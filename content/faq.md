    question_list:
        - question: How do I sign up for QuickTakes?
          answer: You can sign up using the web application on this site or download the mobile app from either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store and then sign up when you open the app.
        - question: How do I record a class lecture?
          answer: To record a class lecture press the record button at the bottom of the app. It will pulsate letting you know that it is actively recording.
        - question: Can I pause the recording and then resume it?
          answer: Currently stopping the recording will complete the record process and then AI-generated materials will be returned. Recordings that are less than 5 minutes tend to have lower quality information than longer recordings. In the near future we will offer the ability to pause a recording and then resume.
        - question: Can I record my professor or teacher’s entire lecture?
          answer: Yes, if that lecture is under 60 minutes. We also limit the weekly number of classes you can record. Recordings will automatically stop at the 60 minute mark and then AI-generated materials will be published back to the QuickTakes app. In the future longer recording times per class and expanded limits on total QuickTakes per week will be available via subscription.
        - question: How long does it take to publish the AI-generated learning materials i.e. “QuickTake” after my recording ends?
          answer: Getting the AI-generated materials back to the app can take up to 15 minutes after the recording has completed. The native mobile apps will send a notification once the process has completed. The web app will have a message in the message center that alerts you to new materials available.
        - question: What do I get when I record a lecture and create a new QuickTake?
          answer: Once you have recorded the lecture through the app, we return a "QuickTake" to you that includes a transcript of the lecture , study guide, glossary of definitions, outline, practice problems and even recommended videos all determined by our prompts to an AI engine. We also provide an AI chatbot that can converse with you about the lecture subject matter if the referenced learning materials aren't enough or if you have more specific questions about the lecture topics. I hope that helps!
        - question: Can I share a QuickTake from my class lecture with other classmates?
          answer: Yes, we provide standard sharing functionality that allows students to share via text, email, social media, etc. The shared QuickTake will be available to them with an internet connection in the app. Then, they can sign up and start using QuickTakes on their own!
        - question: What is the AI Chatbot?
          answer: The AI Chatbot is your connection to an artificial intelligence that knows a lot about the topics discussed in the QuickTakes of your lecture. Ask more detailed questions about those topics to benefit from millions of other data points the chatbot has collected. The AI-Chatbot is available 24/7 and can provide more detail on the topics covered during the lecture. This is your chance to have a virtual conversation with a knowledgeable bot specifically about your lecture.
        - question: Are there copyright restrictions to using QuickTakes?
          answer: Please refer to the Terms of Use for detailed information. QuickTakes does not share or distribute the recordings and creates secondary materials for students to better understand the topics and themes of the lecture recordings. If your school or professor does not allow recordings of lectures you are required to follow school and professor policies.
        - question: How can I get quickTakes for pre-recorded lectures (like youtube videos)?
          answer: To record a non-live lecture (such as a Youtube video or audio lecture) we have a work-around while we develop the ability to insert a video/audio URL. You'll need to have another (second) device such as a computer - one for playing the pre-recorded lecture and one for using QuickTakes. We recommend downloading the QuickTakes app to your phone (available in both Apple App Store and Google Play Store). Launch the QuickTakes app and press record keeping the phone near your computer where you are playing the pre-recorded online audio. End the recording when the online audio is over and you should get a QuickTake returned to you.
        - question: Can I listen to the lecture I recorded to receive a QuickTake?
          answer: While we do make recordings, those recordings are fed into an AI-engine to produce a transcript, study guide, practice problems, outline, and glossary of the recorded lecture. So, while you get returned all these valuable study aids, we don't actually provide the ability to hear the recording after it is uploaded to create these documents. We are looking into possibly doing this and will update our QuickTakes users if we're able to implement this functionality.
        - question: Does QuickTakes support multiple languages?
          answer: Yes, we currently support English, French, Chinese and Spanish. After you press the record button you will see a drop down menu on the left-hand side where you can choose one of these languages. The default is English but you can change that to your chosen language that we currently support. We will add new languages over time.
        - question: Is QuickTakes free to use?
          answer: The basic QuickTakes app is free to use. We will be introducing paid features in the near future. So please stay tuned! We've found that our student users get a lot of value by being able to focus on the lecture and not spend as much time taking notes - which leads to better understanding of the material and hopefully better grades - so some aspects of QuickTakes will always be free.
        - question: My QuickTakes “errored out” or the QuickTake was inaccurate. Why?
          answer: When there is an error processing a recording the QuickTake will come back errored out with no learning materials. Or if the quality of the recording was poor the QuickTake due to either a poor internet connection or obstruction of the mic, you may get back a QuickTake that has inaccurate information. Please try again with another lecture and be sure to be close to the lecturer so that your mic can get a quality recording.
        - question: I had other problems/issues using QuickTakes. What should I do?
          answer: If the QuickTakes app is not working for you, we recommend signing out (under Settings) and then signing in again. If that doesn't work, try deleting the app and reinstalling it. Also, you can use the web browser version from your mobile device or computer by opening your web browser and going to QuickTakes.io and signing in via the web.
