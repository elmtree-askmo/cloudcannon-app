      - question: How do I sign up for QuickTakes?
        answer: >-
          <p>You can sign up using the web application on this site or download
          the mobile app from either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store
          and then sign up when you open the app.</p>
      - question: How do I record a class lecture?
        answer: >-
          To record a class lecture press the record button at the bottom of the
          app. It will pulsate letting you know that it is actively recording.
      - question: Can I pause the recording and then resume it?
        answer: >-
          <p>Yes, you can click “pause” to pause the recording if your professor
          takes a break and then click “resume” to restart when the lecture starts
          back up. To stop the recording click the red record button and the
          recording will complete the record process, then the AI-generated
          materials (your QuickTake) will be returned.&nbsp;</p>
      - question: Can I record my professor or teacher’s entire lecture?
        answer: >-
          <p>Yes, you can. We provide 90 free weekly recording minutes (Sunday -
          Saturday) every week. If you need more time for recording an individual
          lecture or multiple lectures you can purchase QT Boost in increments of
          90 minutes for $1.99 each. QT Boost minutes are good for 30 days so they
          won’t go to waste if you don’t use them all in any given week. We do not
          limit the amount of time you can record on a per session basis - so if
          you have a two hour lecture and more than 120 available weekly recording
          minutes then you can record the entire lecture!</p>
      - question: >-
          How long does it take to publish the AI-generated learning materials
          i.e. “QuickTake” after my recording ends?
        answer: >-
          Getting the AI-generated materials back to the app can take up to 15
          minutes after the recording has completed. The native mobile apps will
          send a notification once the process has completed. The web app will
          have a message in the message center that alerts you to new materials
          available.
      - question: What do I get when I record a lecture and create a new QuickTake?
        answer: >-
          Once you have recorded the lecture through the app, we return a
          "QuickTake" to you that includes a transcript of the lecture , study
          guide, glossary of definitions, outline, practice problems and even
          recommended videos all determined by our prompts to an AI engine. We
          also provide an AI chatbot that can converse with you about the lecture
          subject matter if the referenced learning materials aren't enough or if
          you have more specific questions about the lecture topics. I hope that
          helps!
      - question: Can I share a QuickTake from my class lecture with other classmates?
        answer: >-
          Yes, we provide standard sharing functionality that allows students to
          share via text, email, social media, etc. The shared QuickTake will be
          available to them with an internet connection in the app. Then, they can
          sign up and start using QuickTakes on their own!
      - question: What is the AI Chatbot?
        answer: >-
          The AI Chatbot is your connection to an artificial intelligence that
          knows a lot about the topics discussed in the QuickTakes of your
          lecture. Ask more detailed questions about those topics to benefit from
          millions of other data points the chatbot has collected. The AI-Chatbot
          is available 24/7 and can provide more detail on the topics covered
          during the lecture. This is your chance to have a virtual conversation
          with a knowledgeable bot specifically about your lecture.
      - question: Are there copyright restrictions to using QuickTakes?
        answer: >-
          Please refer to the Terms of Use for detailed information. QuickTakes
          does not share or distribute the recordings and creates secondary
          materials for students to better understand the topics and themes of the
          lecture recordings. If your school or professor does not allow
          recordings of lectures you are required to follow school and professor
          policies.
      - question: >-
          How can I get quickTakes for pre-recorded lectures (like youtube
          videos)?
        answer: >-
          <p>To record a non-live lecture (such as a Youtube video or audio
          lecture) we have a work-around while we develop the ability to insert a
          video/audio URL. You'll need to have another (second) device such as a
          computer - one for playing the pre-recorded lecture and one for using
          QuickTakes. Download the QuickTakes app to your phone (available in both
          Apple App Store and Google Play Store). Launch the QuickTakes app on
          your mobile device and press record keeping the phone near your computer
          where you are playing the pre-recorded online audio. End the recording
          when the online audio is over and you’ll get a QuickTake returned to
          you.</p>
      - question: Can I listen to the lecture I recorded to receive a QuickTake?
        answer: >-
          While we do make recordings, those recordings are fed into an AI-engine
          to produce a transcript, study guide, practice problems, outline, and
          glossary of the recorded lecture. So, while you get returned all these
          valuable study aids, we don't actually provide the ability to hear the
          recording after it is uploaded to create these documents. We are looking
          into possibly doing this and will update our QuickTakes users if we're
          able to implement this functionality.
      - question: Does QuickTakes support multiple languages?
        answer: >-
          Yes, we currently support English, French, Chinese and Spanish. After
          you press the record button you will see a drop down menu on the
          left-hand side where you can choose one of these languages. The default
          is English but you can change that to your chosen language that we
          currently support. We will add new languages over time.
      - question: Is QuickTakes free to use?
        answer: >-
          <p>The basic QuickTakes app is free to use up to 90 minutes per week,
          every week! If you need more time for recording an individual lecture or
          multiple lectures you can purchase QT Boosts in increments of 90 minutes
          for US$1.99 each. Boost minutes are good for up to 30 days so they won’t
          go to waste if you don’t use them all in any given week and will
          rollover into the next week. We will be providing additional paid
          subscription features in the near future.</p><p>We've found that our
          student users get a lot of value by being able to focus on the lecture
          and not spend as much time taking notes - which leads to better
          understanding of the material and hopefully better grades - so some
          aspects of QuickTakes will always be free.</p>
      - question: My QuickTakes “errored out” or the QuickTake was inaccurate. Why?
        answer: >-
          When there is an error processing a recording the QuickTake will come
          back errored out with no learning materials. Or if the quality of the
          recording was poor the QuickTake due to either a poor internet
          connection or obstruction of the mic, you may get back a QuickTake that
          has inaccurate information. Please try again with another lecture and be
          sure to be close to the lecturer so that your mic can get a quality
          recording.
      - question: I had other problems/issues using QuickTakes. What should I do?
        answer: >-
          If the QuickTakes app is not working for you, we recommend signing out
          (under Settings) and then signing in again. If that doesn't work, try
          deleting the app and reinstalling it. Also, you can use the web browser
          version from your mobile device or computer by opening your web browser
          and going to QuickTakes.io and signing in via the web.
