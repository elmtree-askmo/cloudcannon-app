            To record a class lecture press the record button at the bottom of the
            app. It will pulsate letting you know that it is actively recording.

            <p>Yes, you can click “pause” to pause the recording if your professor
            takes a break and then click “resume” to restart when the lecture
            starts back up. To stop the recording click the red record button and
            the recording will complete the record process, then the AI-generated
            materials (your QuickTake) will be returned.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, you can. We provide 90 free weekly recording minutes (Sunday -
            Saturday) every week. If you need more time for recording an
            individual lecture or multiple lectures you can purchase QT Boost in
            increments of 90 minutes for $1.99 each. QT Boost minutes are good for
            30 days so they won’t go to waste if you don’t use them all in any
            given week. We do not limit the amount of time you can record on a per
            session basis - so if you have a two hour lecture and more than 120
            available weekly recording minutes then you can record the entire
            lecture!</p>

            How long does it take to publish the AI-generated learning materials
            i.e. “QuickTake” after my recording ends?

            Getting the AI-generated materials back to the app can take up to 15
            minutes after the recording has completed. The native mobile apps will
            send a notification once the process has completed. The web app will
            have a message in the message center that alerts you to new materials
            available.

            Once you have recorded the lecture through the app, we return a
            "QuickTake" to you that includes a transcript of the lecture , study
            guide, glossary of definitions, outline, practice problems and even
            recommended videos all determined by our prompts to an AI engine. We
            also provide an AI chatbot that can converse with you about the
            lecture subject matter if the referenced learning materials aren't
            enough or if you have more specific questions about the lecture
            topics. I hope that helps!

            Yes, we provide standard sharing functionality that allows students to
            share via text, email, social media, etc. The shared QuickTake will be
            available to them with an internet connection in the app. Then, they
            can sign up and start using QuickTakes on their own!

            The AI Chatbot is your connection to an artificial intelligence that
            knows a lot about the topics discussed in the QuickTakes of your
            lecture. Ask more detailed questions about those topics to benefit
            from millions of other data points the chatbot has collected. The
            AI-Chatbot is available 24/7 and can provide more detail on the topics
            covered during the lecture. This is your chance to have a virtual
            conversation with a knowledgeable bot specifically about your lecture.

            Please refer to the Terms of Use for detailed information. QuickTakes
            does not share or distribute the recordings and creates secondary
            materials for students to better understand the topics and themes of
            the lecture recordings. If your school or professor does not allow
            recordings of lectures you are required to follow school and professor
            policies.

            <p>To record a non-live lecture (such as a Youtube video or audio
            lecture) simply upload your audio/video file, pdf or paste a Youtube
            URL and you'll get returned a QuickTake! PDFs are free to upload
            without taking any of your recording time (your'e welcome!).</p>

            While we do make recordings, those recordings are fed into an
            AI-engine to produce a transcript, study guide, practice problems,
            outline, and glossary of the recorded lecture. So, while you get
            returned all these valuable study aids, we don't actually provide the
            ability to hear the recording after it is uploaded to create these
            documents. We are looking into possibly doing this and will update our
            QuickTakes users if we're able to implement this functionality.

            Yes, we currently support English, French, Chinese and Spanish. After
            you press the record button you will see a drop down menu on the
            left-hand side where you can choose one of these languages. The
            default is English but you can change that to your chosen language
            that we currently support. We will add new languages over time.

        answer: 
          en: >-
            <p>The basic QuickTakes app is free to use up to 90 minutes per week,
            every week! If you need more time for recording an individual lecture
            or multiple lectures you can purchase QT Boosts in increments of 90
            minutes for US$1.99 each. Boost minutes are good for up to 30 days so
            they won’t go to waste if you don’t use them all in any given week and
            will rollover into the next week. We will be providing additional paid
            subscription features in the near future.</p><p>We've found that our
            student users get a lot of value by being able to focus on the lecture
            and not spend as much time taking notes - which leads to better
            understanding of the material and hopefully better grades - so some
            aspects of QuickTakes will always be free.</p>

            When there is an error processing a recording the QuickTake will come
            back errored out with no learning materials. Or if the quality of the
            recording was poor the QuickTake due to either a poor internet
            connection or obstruction of the mic, you may get back a QuickTake
            that has inaccurate information. Please try again with another lecture
            and be sure to be close to the lecturer so that your mic can get a
            quality recording.

            If the QuickTakes app is not working for you, we recommend signing out
            (under Settings) and then signing in again. If that doesn't work, try
            deleting the app and reinstalling it. Also, you can use the web
            browser version from your mobile device or computer by opening your
            web browser and going to QuickTakes.io and signing in via the web.
