Preparing to live at college, whether you are going to college in or out of state, begins far before move-in day.

### **Clothes, Shoes, and Accessories**

Going through my clothes is always the lengthiest task, so it’s generally where I start. Now, if you are someone with a packed closet (like me), you will have to come to terms with the fact that you will not be able to take all of your clothes with you. Even if you could, let’s be honest, you will not use all of your clothes. This is a great time to clean out your closet and pick out the clothes you feel best in, and potentially donate some that you have outgrown.

College dorms normally only provide a small closet and a drawer. I start off by picking out my favorite bottoms; 5-7 pairs of jeans, 2-3 skirts, and 2-3 pairs of shorts. Now that our bottoms are picked, I will choose 2-3 tops that I know I will wear with each of the bottoms. As for jackets, you only really need one heavy jacket for colder seasons (unless you go to school where it snows) and 2-3 light jackets/sweatshirts. Keeping your packing frugal and intentional will help you pick outfits that you know you will wear and can later form a sort of rotation. This works especially well if you are running short on time in the morning - you just pick out a bottom and its corresponding top and run out the door.

Bring ALL of your socks and undergarments! You can never have too many. You will lose socks or forget to do laundry. These are the pieces of clothing that you do not want to run out of. In fact, go buy an extra pack of each.

Now we can factor in special occasions. I would bring one professional outfit (whether that be a suit, slacks and button up, dress) for internship interviews or class presentations, and one formal outfit (nice dress or suit) for any events that require formal attire.

For shoes, we want to have a similar system as we do with clothes. You will want to pick shoes that fit most of the outfits you have put together and have a diversity of shoe types. This will consist roughly of one pair of each of the following: nice sneakers, ‘party’ shoes, sandals, shower shoes, running/gym shoes, and heels/dress shoes. Trust me, you will not need ten pairs of shoes.

Finally, if you love to accessorize, this is where you may be able to bring it all. Jewelry, head pieces, hats, glasses, bags, etc. Unless you have an overflow closet of accessories, you should be able to bring whatever you’d like from this category.

### **School Supplies**

As much as I love the nostalgic feeling of going to Walmart or Target and picking out a ton of cute back-to-school supplies like I did in K-12, this isn’t necessary when you are packing for college.

My freshman year of college, I bought so many sparkly pens, every color highlighter and sticky note, cute folders, colorful paperclips, a binder, etc. Well… I hate to say that I used none of it. You truly do not need much for your classes. If you decide to take notes on your iPad or laptop, then you only need a notebook and some pens. If you like taking written notes, then you will only need 2-3 notebooks a year to write things down, pens, pencils, and maybe some highlighters. A planner is another useful tool, whether it’s on your electronic device or in physical form. You won’t need a large backpack to fit these things - any comfortable bag/tote/backpack will do.

Other than that, having tape, scissors, and a small stapler are the only other office supplies that will be handy on your desk. Remember to bring all of your chargers and extension cords. If you don’t like to use a laptop when working in your room, pick a good monitor, speaker, keyboard, and mouse for your set up!

### **Room Set-Up**

Unless you are okay with having to pack up boxes of decorations at the end of the year, I don’t recommend bringing an excess of decorations. I personally like to slowly build up a wall where I tape pictures, receipts, flyers, etc. of the events I attend and the memories I make as the school year progresses; it makes for some great conversations if you invite anyone into your room and gives others a glimpse into your personality and interests.

The same thing goes for having many pillows or plushies. My freshman year, I brought a large garbage bag full of decorative pillows and plushies, and it ultimately became a hassle having to throw them onto the floor each night to sleep comfortably and then arrange them in the morning. Bring one pillow to sleep on and 2-3 plushies if that’s your style. Having a lot of things on your bed makes it harder to maintain in the long run.

Finally, if you have a hard time keeping track of your activities, classes, sections, and assignment due dates, I would suggest having a whiteboard calendar in your room near your desk or a place where you can clearly see it. You can color code your assignments with different markers or create little symbols for appointments and events. Every 1st of the month, I look forward to setting up my calendar, and it is a great way to reset if the last month did not go as you expected. Having a visual reminder also helps me not procrastinate on assignments; oh how satisfying it is to cross out that little square at the end of the day!

### **Conclusion**

I hope these tips have been helpful and wish you the best in your college experience, whether it is your first year or any one that follows. Below you will find a basic college packing list curated by me if you need any extra help. Good luck!
