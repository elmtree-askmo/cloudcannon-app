Flashcards are a tried and true method of studying, depending on your learning style. While for some learners, writing and rewriting their notes helps them learn best, others seek more time-efficient strategies. Though online flashcard solutions aren’t a new development, manual creation can be time-consuming. Using AI to generate flashcards from your detailed lecture materials is not just futuristic—it's a practical solution available today.

Using platforms like QuickTakes, which use live lecture recordings, Youtube videos, PDFs, and more to generate a variety of study materials, you’ll almost instantly have not only study guides and outlines available post-lecture, but also auto-generated flashcards to deepen your understanding. You may be wondering, how are flashcards beneficial for me? Do they really help me ace my test? Here are a few ways that flashcards can be a highly effective study tool for students:

### Active Recall

Active recall is a key tenet of flashcards, and means actively retrieving information from your memory without looking at the source material. It strengthens your memory pathways by reinforcing retention of information, as well as helps identify areas where your understanding is lacking. By using flashcards or answering practice questions, you engage your brain more deeply than passive review such as reading a textbook.

### **Ease of Use**

Having flashcards and your lecture notes all within one app makes studying easier and more accessible than it’s ever been. You won’t have to worry about forgetting your flashcards in your dorm or having them be out of order. No more jumping back and forth between your notebook and your online flashcards, either. Simply open up QuickTakes on your phone or laptop whenever you have a moment in your busy schedule, and start studying wherever you left off. Not to mention, it’s easy to switch between subjects as well as include formulas, definitions, and more.

### **Repetition & Reinforcement**

Repetition is another important part of studying that leads to the reinforcement of information in the mind. Spaced repetition is when you review concepts at increasing intervals, which strengthens your long-term retention of the material. Say you cram for 7 hours one day before your test. Your test performance is likely to be worse than if you study for 1 hour each day over the course of 7 days. Regularly reviewing your flashcards over a period of time helps the information transfer from short-term to long-term memory, thereby solidifying the concepts and helping you ace your exam.

Flashcards offer a multifaceted approach to test preparation through active recall, ease of use, and repetition. Using tools like QuickTakes to auto-generate flashcards from lecture materials makes studying more efficient and effective. By incorporating these techniques into your study routine, you’ll be better prepared to retain information and bolster your performance and grades.
