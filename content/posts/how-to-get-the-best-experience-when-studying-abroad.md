Studying abroad is an amazing experience if you have the opportunity. Getting to immerse yourself in a new culture is something many people won’t have the chance to do during their lives, but one that can majorly expand your world views and give you new perspectives. There are a lot of uncertainties that can come with moving to a different country, so read on for advice from QuickTakes on how to get the best experience out of studying abroad.

### **Do your best to learn the language**

Wherever you land, one or multiple other languages could be spoken than what you grew up speaking. Taking language classes a few months to a few years ahead of time can set you up with a good foundation to be able to communicate with the locals where you’re studying. There’s a commonly said phrase when learning a new language - the best way to learn is to immerse yourself in the culture. Studying abroad offers this perfect opportunity, as you may run into scenarios when nobody around speaks your native language, and you have to figure out other ways to communicate. This challenge is a great way to accelerate your language learning journey.

### **Travel, but keep sight on your schoolwork**

You’re in a different country - take advantage! Whether it be taking the train to neighboring cities or flights to other states and countries, you have the opportunity to see a variety of new places. However, be aware of your school schedule and make sure to give priority to your classwork and mandated events. You can suffer big penalties for missing too many classes while studying abroad, so don’t overbook yourself when you travel. Make sure to account for some downtime in your city of study as well, as there is also a lot to learn and explore without going too far!

### **Do an internship if you can**

Doing an internship in another country is an awesome chance to get a more worldly view of the career you hope to go into. Additionally, it lets you make connections around the globe that could secure you recommendations, a future job, or simply some great life advice and resources that you otherwise wouldn’t have. Say you are from Los Angeles and are studying abroad in Milan. Those are two fashion capitals of the world, but ones that differ greatly in brands, practice, and style, to name a few. Your future career can benefit greatly from the exposure to more than one way of thinking, designing, and overall doing.

### **Don’t go overboard on the drinking**

It’s the elephant in the room, particularly for American foreign exchange students. While many other countries have 18+ drinking ages, the U.S. is more stringent with a 21+ drinking age. Thus, when many American students go to study abroad, drinking and going out is one of the more pressing thoughts on their minds. We get it - the QuickTakes team doesn’t shy away from a little fun, too. However, don’t discount the cautions of your parents and school administrators. Oftentimes, when things are newly and overwhelmingly accessible, there is a great possibility to abuse them. Don’t be the student that loses your apartment keys or gets in trouble at school the first few weeks of your study abroad program. Trust in moderation, don’t go out alone, and use good judgment when in new social situations. Alcohol will be there for the rest of your life… this experience will not.

Studying abroad is a next-level adventure that you don’t want to miss out on if you can help it. By learning the language, you can immerse yourself in the culture and really get the most out of your time abroad. Traveling is an obviously attractive part of studying internationally, but remember to not sacrifice your grades and set yourself back in your academic career because of it. Work towards your future by taking part in an internship, not only to bolster your resume but also to gain a more worldly view of the industry you hope to be part of long-term. Lastly, be smart. We won’t lecture you like an elder, but take it to heart, if only because we know people who have (or have ourselves!) made the same mistakes we caution you about. Enjoy every minute, make good choices, and you’ll come back with amazing memories and a fresh outlook on life.
