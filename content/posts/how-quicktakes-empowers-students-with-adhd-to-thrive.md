Whether you have ADHD or not, you have probably heard of some of the most common symptoms - difficulty with attention, hyperfocus, task switching, fidgeting, to name a few. With an estimated 8.7 million adults in the U.S. diagnosed with ADHD, it’s no surprise that multiple students in each class may be diagnosed (or undiagnosed) with it. However, what many people fail to comprehend is that these symptoms can make class time and studying a daunting and difficult task, and that often there are not adequate support systems and resources provided by universities. Let’s dive into the unique challenges faced by students with ADHD, and how apps like QuickTakes are pioneering a more inclusive and enjoyable learning environment that’s making a difference in their academic lives.

### Notetaking

For ADHD students who struggle to maintain focus during long lectures, note taking services can be a gamechanger for them. Instead of worrying about missing important information while their attention wanders, students can trust in apps like QuickTakes to capture every word said, and focus on taking the notes that matter most to them. Many professors speak quickly, are hard to understand if their native language isn’t the same as yours, or present slides that have minimal information compared to what they share verbally. Even for students without ADHD, this pace can be difficult to keep up with in a grueling semester. However, students with ADHD may get left behind if they can’t capture relevant lecture information in a timely fashion.

### Study Materials

When you have ADHD, sitting down to study can feel like a battle against endless distractions—everything from the laundry to unanswered texts seems more pressing. With a binder full of notes, handouts, and class material, how do you begin to make sense of it all and distill it down into something meaningful to study for your exams? Note taking may be the first hurdle, but an equally important and stressful one can be fashioning those notes into study materials. QuickTakes addresses this struggle directly by automatically generating study materials, allowing you to focus on learning rather than the tedious task of creating flashcards, study guides, or outlines. Whether you need help digesting a PDF assigned for reading or the lecture as a whole, there is a wealth of information and ways to study it available in each QuickTake. For incoming college students still developing their study habits, having immediate access to various learning materials is an invaluable tool, allowing them to discover what works best without the added stress of figuring it out on their own.

### How QuickTakes Empowers Students with ADHD

QuickTakes sat down with a few college students diagnosed with ADHD who wanted to share the transformative impact QuickTakes has had on their academic journey. They shared similar struggles with keeping up with the fast pace of lectures or staying engaged in virtual classes, but noticed a tangible shift when they integrated QuickTakes into their daily routine. One student explained how QuickTakes helped him break down long, tedious videos and lectures, making it easier to understand the material without sitting through overwhelming content. Another student highlighted that QuickTakes’ study guides and visual aids allowed her to engage with her coursework in a way traditional methods could not, significantly boosting her grades and her confidence.

These insights underscore the importance of accessible study tools tailored to the needs of students with ADHD. QuickTakes not only provides detailed transcripts and summaries but also organizes information in manageable formats, helping students stay on top of their coursework without feeling lost or frustrated. By capturing lectures and turning them into structured, easy-to-understand study materials, QuickTakes is not just a tool—it's a lifeline that empowers students with ADHD to succeed academically.
