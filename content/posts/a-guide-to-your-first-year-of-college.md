You made it! You’ve been accepted into college, and now the road begins. It is a time filled with so many mixed feelings - excitement to be done with high school, nervousness to leave family and friends behind, curiosity for all you will learn, fear to move to a new place. At QuickTakes (an app made *for* college students!) we have all been to college in different eras and different places around the world. Below, we’ll explore some tips on how to embrace your first year of college and all it has to offer.

### Take advantage of orientation

You’re moving into your dorm. You’re going to a million different meetings. You’re meeting a seemingly endless sea of people and professors. Orientation can be overwhelming! But it can also set the foundations for your college experience if you let it. Many people meet their lifelong friends in these first few days before school starts, but if that’s not your journey, don’t sweat it. You’ve still got many years to find your people! A plethora of information will be thrown at your during this time, whether it be school policies, how to register for classes, clubs to join, and activities to participate in. Look over your orientation schedule in advance and familiarize yourself with what is required and what voluntary events you want to attend. There is a little something for everyone, so whether you’re a socialite, a bookworm, an athlete, or anything in between, seek out what helps you feel most at home.

### **Pay attention to important dates and deadlines**

Class registration dates are one of the most important deadlines you’ll need to pay attention to throughout your years of college. Generally, there will be a registration window and you’ll get slotted into it based on a variety of factors such as number of credits completed, special standings (such as honors or student athletes), any holds you have on your account, etc. Classes fill up QUICK, so being on top of it is important to make sure you get the classes relevant to your major, and the teachers that you prefer.

### **Make use of academic and peer advisors**

On this note, it’s important to utilize your academic advisors and peer counselors. Academic advisors can take a look at your major as a whole and plan out where you should slot in classes each year. They can run degree audits, view major/minor requirements, explain policies such as add/drop, and overall make the confusing world of class registration a bit less daunting. Peer counselors can also be an invaluable resource, as they may have been in your shoes just a year or two ago, so can give you insider tips on the best professors to choose, what electives are most fit to your interests, and other on-the-ground perspectives that a staff member might not have.

### **Get involved with students clubs and organizations**

This is some of the most common advice current and former students have. College goes by quick, and it’s easy to get caught up in classes and social life. However, even joining 1 club or organization can be invaluable for your future. Whether it’s an academic or social sorority/fraternity, an organization related to your major, or a club related to one of your interests/hobbies, it’s a great way to meet more people on campus, learn more, and leverage connections in the future.

### **Keep an eye on networking and career development opportunities**

We may be jumping the gun here - you just started college, after all! However, it’s never too early to start networking, and your future self will thank you. Colleges offer a variety of networking opportunities, whether they be club/organization events or fireside chats with a visiting company. They also will host workshops such as to build resumes or cover letters, or to discuss interview tips for internships and post-grad positions. It can be easy to let all your college years go by without attending a single one - speaking from experience. But when you’re thrown in the sea of young professionals looking for their first job, you’ll be seeking out these resources, guaranteed. It may just be a little bit harder to find them without the support of your school. So whether you’re a freshman or a senior, set a goal to attend even one event a quarter, and you’ll be ahead of the game.

<br>We understand that your nervousness may not be abated after some of these *big* tips, but nobody, including us, ever had it figured out since day 1. We go through life, we learn what we could have done better, and we try to adapt our lives and impart that knowledge on the next generation. Lucky for you, you live in the age of AI and endless information and possibilities at your fingertips. You’ll always have these resources at the ready, so whether you listen to our blog today or when you’re a college senior or 10 years after you’ve graduated, you’re never too late to make valuable connections and a valuable impact on the world. You got this, and QuickTakes has got your back, too.
