Summer often feels like the finish line at the end of a long school year, but many of your peers may be signed up for summer sessions. While you may opt to spend the summer unwinding or diving into an internship, summer classes can be a beneficial way to keep your degree on track, or even accelerate it! Below are a few reasons to consider signing up for your university’s summer session. Note that this information will vary by school, and it’s important to check with your academic advisor to see what the best solution is for you.

### Cost Effective

Oftentimes summer courses will have reduced fees compared to regular-term courses. Some ways that universities may lower the cost is by offering a discount, such as a 25% reduction in tuition fees over summer, or by refunding campus-based fees for a select number of courses. This makes summer sessions particularly attractive as well as more accessible for families of a variety of income levels.

### Shorter Timespan

The length of summer sessions can majorly differ depending on the university and the specific course. While some sessions may be closer to a regular term length (i.e. 10+ weeks), many sessions are offered at a shortened term length (i.e. 4, 6, or 8 weeks). This can make the course more rigorous, as a full term’s material is covered within an abbreviated amount of time, but generally the number of hours spent in class per week is higher than it would be during a regular term. The shortened terms may be an attractive option for students hoping to vacation or participate in an internship/job, as they can dedicate half or less of their summer to classes, and the other half where they please.

### Accelerated Graduation Timeline

If you are hoping to graduate in a shorter period of time than your major designates, summer courses are a great way to achieve this. Doing 1 summer course every year could give you the opportunity to graduate a quarter/semester early. Or in the case of having to take a reduced course load during one year of school, you can help catch back up to your planned graduation date. If you want to be more aggressive in your approach and take multiple summer courses each year, you could shave off an entire year from your estimated graduation date.

All in all, whatever pace you choose to go at for your academic journey is the right one, because it’s tailored to your needs. Summer school can offer an attractive option for those looking to catch up or get ahead on their course material, as well as potentially save money.
