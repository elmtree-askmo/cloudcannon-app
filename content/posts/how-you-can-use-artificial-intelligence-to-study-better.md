Artificial intelligence has been the new wave of the world since ChatGPT’s emergence in the end of 2022. With it has come many questions and new implications for students, working professionals, and everyone in between. Primary and higher education institutions are quickly trying to navigate what this means for them in and out of the classroom. While some teachers or universities opt for a zero tolerance policy for AI, others are encouraging their students to use it to their advantage (think: *study smarter, not harder*).

That begs the question - how can you use AI to make your minutes count more, to improve your workflow, and to refine your overall study habits? Read on for some of our suggestions.

### **Sort through the relevant and irrelevant**

‘The Ezra Klein Show’ (an Apple Podcast) released an episode titled [“How Should I Be Using A.I. Right Now?”](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-should-i-be-using-a-i-right-now/id1548604447?i=1000651164959) which offered some interesting insights on ways that AI can be brought to the table in a real and *ethical* way. One point discussed in an academic setting was how to sort through the most relevant information for a reader (i.e, your professor reading your paper). Whether that be digging through citations for the most important & quality sources or simply asking if your point is understandable and useful to your end goal or not, AI is perfectly poised to do it.

### **Develop your critical thinking by asking the right questions**

To sort through what is relevant and get the outputs that you want, you will need some understanding of prompt engineering. In layman's terms, this means asking the right questions to the AI to get relevant, quality answers. Without context, AI can give you general but not subject-specific information. Prompt engineering will only become more relevant as AI becomes more intertwined with our society, so it’s a core competency to learn as soon as possible. Not only will it help you get more out of your prompts, but it will also help you better understand what critical questions to ask online and offline. In the digital age where information overload is a common challenge, these skills are more crucial than ever.

### Structure your notes into quality study materials

You’re certainly not alone if you’ve been in a lecture scribbling notes as fast as possible before your professor changes the slide or goes off on a tangent. By the end of class, your once color-coded and painstakingly organized notes may look more like a first grader’s attempt at writing, or a series of incomplete bullet points hastily typed into your computer. Besides worrying about getting every relevant point down, you’re now left to decipher your own notes and try to make something useful out of them to study. AI offers a few solutions to this issue.

First, apps such as QuickTakes offer transcription services based on audio recordings, which helps relieve the burden of getting every word said written down and instead lets you actively participate in class and take the notes that matter most to you. Secondly, AI can easily ingest your notes to create structured outlines, study guides, and more. Instead of spending hours just *preparing* to study, spend that time *actually studying!*

As AI keeps rapidly evolving, don’t be left behind while the rest of the world adapts. Students have more opportunities than ever to use AI to their advantage, not to cut corners or replace the need to learn, but to bolster their education and finetune their studying to be more efficient and effective than ever. From organizing information to developing critical thinking skills, AI is a supertool that will help you navigate each class, grade level, and particularly your post-grad life.

By embracing AI as a partner in your academic journey, you can unlock new possibilities for success.
