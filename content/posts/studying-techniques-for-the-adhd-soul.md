Studying can be a hurdle for anyone at any age. For many students, the challenge can be carving out the time to study while putting life on the back burner. For others, this challenge can be finding the right method; they might be reading and re-reading the same information repeatedly without absorbing any of the information. While reading is beneficial and crucial to the learning process, simply re-reading class materials hinders the absorption process rather than benefiting it. To gain the most from your classes and study sessions, you must participate in what we call “active studying,” where you construct and deconstruct the materials and make real-life connections that will stay with your brain for a longer duration.

&nbsp;

Many of us need help with our attention span and staying motivated in our work and studies. The Pomodoro technique helps build repetition and routine and rewards students with small breaks to rest their brains. A simple and effective technique, the student selects a singular task to hone in on. Then, a timer is set for 15-30 minutes; beginners can start as small as they need, and more advanced users of this technique may take advantage of longer durations of time. When the timer is finished, the student may take a water, rest, or exercise break. One tip many students have for others is to stay off your phone. Find another rewarding activity to do during that break, and lock your phone away until the end of your study session. Repeat this process several times, and then take a much-deserved 30-minute break before diving back in!
