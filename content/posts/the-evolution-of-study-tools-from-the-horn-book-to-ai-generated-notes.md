With tools like Chat-GPT in circulation for all to use and the overwhelming presence of laptops and the internet in our everyday lives, it is hard to think of a time when schools did not use these means as tools to improve their students’ knowledge . Despite the normalization of screens in our classrooms, it was not until the 2020 pandemic that many schools were pushed to provide a laptop or tablet as an educational tool for all students. Let us take a closer look at the study tools and educational resources that came before:

### The “Horn-Book"

Dating back to the Colonial years, a common tool that was used in schools was the Horn-book. The term ‘horn-book’ (although applied to different study materials in different fields) became a common name for wooden tablets with a handle that held a single sheet of paper and a protective translucent covering of horn (as the name would indicate). This tool was used as a primer for children’s education, and the sheet of paper often consisted of the alphabet, vowel combinations, numerals, religious text, or short verse. These horn-books are thought to be the foundation to the way reading is taught in schools today.

Although not always known as the ‘horn-book,’ this type of study tool can be dated even before the Colonial years to medieval times and a continuing trend up until the mid-nineteenth century when it was ultimately replaced by cardboard ABC books. A magazine founded in 1924 (The Horn Book Magazine) that recommended children’s literature to teachers helped establish the tool as synonymous with children’s education. In law schools, ‘horn-books’ have become a small volume of a larger article of writing that is seen as a stepping stone to law education. Most horn-books were destroyed with time, the few in existence today are found in museums or are referenced in paintings and literature.

### The “Magic Lantern”

A tool that became popular in classrooms in the late-nineteenth century was the ‘Magic Lantern,’ an early type of projector that used paintings, photographs, prints, and pictures on transparent plates of glass, a lens (or multiple), and a light source. It was common for the glass plates to be hand painted, first only in black and white and slowly incorporating colors. The plates normally had to be inserted upside down as the images were inverted by the lens.

This type of projector was seen as a natural successor to the microscope and telescope and was used in classrooms from the late-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century when it eventually was replaced by box televisions and the overhead projector in 1930.

### The Calculator

The calculator was first created in 1960, but it was not until the seventies that the portable calculator entered the classroom when integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. Calculators can be found in the simplest of models today, solving basic arithmetic or they can be bought for specific purposes. A scientific calculator, for example, includes trigonometric and statistical calculations. While a graphing calculator can be used to graph a variety of equations on its tiny screen.

We may take for granted being able to carry our phones in our pockets, but the calculator was the first portable device that was allowed in the classroom. Similar to the radio, the calculator served as a stepping stone for the creation of cell phones and the very first computer models which were made to serve as a calculator at a much larger scale, answering complex mathematical problems.

### The Laptop Computer

In the twenty-first century, it is fair to assume that everyone knows what a laptop is. You may walk into a coffee shop or a college classroom and encounter a variety of models. However, the earliest model of the portable laptop was far from the ones we see today. The IBM 5100 was released in 1975 and it weighed fifty-five pounds - imagine carrying that around with you! At the time it cost around nine to twenty thousand dollars (which would be forty-five to ninety-five thousand dollars today), not making it very accessible to the public. It took another eight years of development before laptops were used as an educational tool in 1983 when Drexel University required every student to buy one.

Today, laptops are the most purchased portable device (outside of cell phones) beating tablets and desktop computers. The laptop’s portability and battery life make productivity possible almost anywhere, especially as most can connect to the internet, cellular networks, or other devices with Bluetooth. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the government funded most public schools to provide Chromebooks and internet hotspots to their students to allow for at-home online education, increasing the use of laptops in K-12 education.

### Classroom Websites and Applications

<br>As laptops and other electronic devices became prominent in classrooms, websites and applications were created for teachers and students to use in the classroom following the social media boom of Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. A popular application for teachers to use in motivating their students and maintaining an organized classroom is *ClassDojo*. It is often used with younger students to promote following rules through the use of a point system which the teacher can then use to provide rewards. In recent years, the app has expanded to include communication with parents about their children’s learning.

Other popular websites include *Kahoot!* and *Duolingo*. *Kahoot!* allows for in-class quizzes where students compete with each other as they answer questions. These quizzes are often created for teachers to understand how well students are comprehending the material or simply for fun. While *Duolingo* is an application that provides materials for in-class and at-home learning of foreign languages. The application itself provides various quizzes, questions, and practice exercises of the chosen language.

### Artificial Intelligence

It was only natural that through the development of software engineering and the invention of various applications and websites, that artificial intelligence would become a presence in our lives. It started first with Siri on Apple devices and then in November of 2022 ChatGPT was released. With the release of ChatGPT, the use of artificial intelligence in the workforce and education skyrocketed calling for the creation of many websites and applications implementing it.

QuickTakes is one of the applications that has developed as a part of this movement, providing AI-generated study materials including an outline, study guide, flashcards, and more. It is a study tool and resource that we hope becomes a staple in your education. It is just one more step towards more accessible, personalized, and fun learning .

What do you think the next study tool will look like?
