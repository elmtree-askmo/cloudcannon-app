## 1\. Prompting Skill: Precision Prompting for Targeted Literature Reviews

Prompting Tips: Specificity is key. Vague prompts yield broad results. Precise prompts pinpoint information.

Example Prompts & Application:

Instead of: "Summarize articles on diabetes." (Too broad)

Use: "Summarize research on Type 2 Diabetes management in elderly patients, focusing on the efficacy of metformin vs. newer SGLT2 inhibitors."

Benefit: Focused summaries on narrow research questions, saving time filtering irrelevant information.

Instead of: "Find gaps in research about heart disease." (Too vague)

Use: "Identify gaps in current research on ischemic heart disease related to preventative interventions in women under 50 years old."

Benefit: Pinpoints niche research areas, directly informing article focus.

Actionable Tip: Incorporate specific medical terms, patient demographics, interventions, and outcomes into prompts for targeted literature review assistance.

## 2\. Prompting Skill: Structured Prompts for Clear Data Interpretation

Prompting Tips: Structure prompts to guide AI data analysis. Provide context and desired output format.

Example Prompts & Application:

Prompt: "Summarize statistical findings on BMI and hypertension correlation in 500 patients over 65. Focus on correlation coefficients and p-values."

Benefit: Summaries highlighting specific statistical measures for results sections.

Prompt: "Explain these results \[Paste findings: increased inflammatory markers in rheumatoid arthritis after drug regimen\] in plain language for healthcare professionals; emphasize clinical significance."

Benefit: AI output tailored for healthcare professionals, focusing on practical implications.

Actionable Tip: Structure prompts to specify data context, analytical focus (statistics, clinical significance), and target audience.

## 3\. Prompting Skill: Outline-Driven Prompts for Article Structure

Prompting Tips: Utilize prompts to generate structured article outlines for efficient organization. Request specific sections and subsections.

Example Prompts & Application:

Prompt: "Create a journal article outline: telehealth impact on medication adherence in rural heart failure patients. Sections: Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion. Discussion subheadings: limitations, future research, clinical implications."

Benefit: Ready-to-use structure, saving organizational planning time.

Prompt: "Develop introduction paragraph: rising antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pneumonia. Highlight public health significance, need for novel treatments."

Benefit: Assistance crafting impactful introductions.

Actionable Tip: Request detailed outlines specifying key journal article sections and subheadings to create a structured writing roadmap.

## 4\. Prompting Skill: Refinement Prompts for Academic Tone

Prompting Tips: Employ prompts to refine drafted text for academic tone, clarity, and precision.

Example Prompts & Application:

Prompt: "Refine for academic tone and clarity: \[Paragraph on patient satisfaction with discharge process\]."

Benefit: Enhanced formality and readability.

Prompt: "Rephrase for conciseness, healthcare journal impact: \[Sentence describing complex surgical technique\]."

Benefit: Improved sentence precision.

Prompt: "Check grammar, spelling, medical terminology: \[Section on drug pharmacokinetic properties\]."

Benefit: Ensured accuracy and professional language.

Actionable Tip: Use refinement prompts focused on academic tone, conciseness, and medical terminology accuracy to polish drafted sections effectively.

Ethical and Accuracy Imperatives

Remember, AI augments, not replaces, expertise. Verification, citation, and ethical data handling are crucial in AI-assisted healthcare writing.

Conclusion: Mastering concise AI prompting skills offers healthcare students a significant advantage in journal article writing, enhancing efficiency and quality.

Explore these prompting skills to elevate your healthcare publications.
