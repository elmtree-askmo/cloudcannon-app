Artificial intelligence has been all anyone is talking about in the last few years, but did you know that it’s been around for much longer than most of us have thought? [Ben Shapiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benshapyro/), a young entrepreneur based in Southern California, began working with AI in 2019, focusing on smart homes, assistants, and automation. Today he leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), agents, and custom Machine Learning (ML) models to speed up his personal and professional workflows.

From college dropout to successful AI director, students and professionals alike have an opportunity to learn from his story.

### **How Did Ben Get to Where He Is Today?**

Ben's path to entrepreneurship was far from linear. Initially attending San Diego State University (SDSU), he faced a lack of motivation and direction that led to him failing out of school and spiraling into a pit of uncertainty and depression. Months later on a backpacking trip in Peru, Ben had the moment of self-reflection and inspiration he needed to turn his life onto a better path. After securing a job that sparked his interest in entrepreneurship as well as building up his credits at a community college, he returned to SDSU as a business major with a specialization in entrepreneurship. While this time was anything but easy, Ben credits his moments at ‘rock bottom’ for the reason he is where he is today.

His goals of turning his ideas into profitable ventures and surrounding himself with innovative thinkers led him to SDSU’s Lavin Center and Entrepreneurship Club, amongst other tech-focused societies. There, he met kindred spirits who have been transformational in his career. His first professional foray into AI came with his inaugural startup, TekMate, which focused on digital education and enablement for seniors. Here, he taught a course on ‘the next 10 years in technology’, with AI playing a forefront role. Many years later, Ben moved on to start his own AI consulting and development business, before landing in his current role as Director of AI at Tide Rock, a holding company that scales B2B businesses using AI.

### **What Are the Implications for Students?**

Ben believes that students should absolutely utilize AI, but they must do so mindfully. In general, AI helps people do things faster, and sometimes even better. However, the output of any AI tool, such as an LLM, should still be viewed as a draft—something that requires fact-checking, proofreading, and editing to become unique, accurate, and refined. This process is crucial for maintaining quality and developing critical thinking skills.

When using AI to learn a topic, students should first ask themselves whether they need a deep, first-principles understanding or just a high-level overview. Without mastering the fundamentals, it becomes difficult to truly innovate. True innovation stems from a deep understanding of how a system works, enabling students to improve or integrate it with other technologies.

Ben also points out that AI is making education more accessible. Today, everyone already has access to 1:1 tutoring through tools like ChatGPT, Khanmigo, or Duolingo Max, making personalized learning more affordable and scalable than ever before. Educational institutions have a responsibility to teach students how to effectively integrate AI into their personal and professional workflows, while also covering critical areas like data privacy, security, and ethics.

As for concerns about AI, particularly around cheating or over-reliance, Ben acknowledges that these are valid and must be addressed. However, history shows us that disruptive technologies—like calculators and computers—faced similar concerns. Over time, these tools became standard parts of everyday life, and Ben believes AI will follow the same trajectory, becoming a common tool that enhances productivity and learning. While he doesn’t agree with all of the legislation being pushed by governments, he is happy that they are being proactive and taking action.

### **What Is Interesting in AI Today?**

“Today, the most exciting thing about AI is that anyone with the internet has access to a general assistant immediately. And, with a little bit of work, they can make that assistant useful in most domains”, Ben says. While most people aren’t using chatGPT even on a weekly basis, there is a whole world awaiting people who use these tools. Before Ben chatted with the QuickTakes team, he said he spent an hour of his day using an AI code editor tool, [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and was able to get a web app up and running in that time. It’s pretty amazing what a little knowledge combined with a powerful tool can do.

To conclude our chat, we asked Ben what emerging technologies or trends deserve our attention. Quantum & Biological computing are some of the most interesting things on his mind today, and he believes that when they can be cracked at scale, we will be a major step closer to figuring out what consciousness is. In turn, we’ll be able to process complex problems exponentially faster. If you’re finding it difficult to wrap your head around, you are not alone! These impossibly large problems are the kind of things that keep entrepreneurs like Ben up at night, searching for the answer.

### **Conclusion**

Ben's journey and insights offer a compelling narrative of the transformative power of AI. As tools like QuickTakes continue to evolve, they promise to enhance learning experiences, making education more accessible, personalized, and effective. Ben's perspective highlights the vast potential of the ed-tech market, particularly in AI-driven solutions that address the evolving needs of modern learners and educators.
