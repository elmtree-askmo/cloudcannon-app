    QuickTakes, a rising player in the education and career-tech space, is
    aiming to change that with the launch of its  Career Center, a new tool
    designed to streamline the job search for students and early-career
    professionals. The feature uses artificial intelligence to match users with
    relevant roles based on their résumé, skills, location, major and salary
    expectations, cutting through the clutter that often defines traditional job
    platforms.
