For millions of students preparing to enter an increasingly competitive job market, the search for internships and entry-level positions has become a demanding and often discouraging process. Long hours spent scrolling through job boards, inconsistent salary information and a lack of clarity about which roles actually align with one’s major or experience have become routine obstacles in the path to early career success.

QuickTakes, a rising player in the education and career-tech space, is aiming to change that with the launch of its **Career Center**, a new tool designed to streamline the job search for students and early-career professionals. The feature uses artificial intelligence to match users with relevant roles based on their résumé, skills, location, major and salary expectations, cutting through the clutter that often defines traditional job platforms.

> “We built this because students are overwhelmed,” said George Chen, president of QuickTakes “The process is confusing, the results are inconsistent and most job boards weren’t created with early-career talent in mind. We wanted to build something that does the heavy lifting for them.”

**Matching Students With Roles That Make Sense**

Unlike large job platforms that rely on broad filters and generic recommendations, the Career Center prioritizes roles that align closely with a user’s background and goals. Internships and entry-level opportunities receive special emphasis, reflecting a common complaint from students who struggle to identify jobs suitable for their stage of experience.

Students testing the feature have already taken notice.

> **“QuickTakes showed me better job matches in 30 seconds than I found in a week,”** said Sofia, a business major who began searching for summer internships this fall.

**Salary Transparency, Localized and Realistic**

One of the biggest challenges for early-career applicants is understanding what a job should pay, especially when salaries vary dramatically by city. The Career Center incorporates localized salary intelligence, highlighting the highest-paying regions, fastest-growing job markets and emerging hotspots in each field.

The feature also includes real-time industry trends, giving students ongoing insight into the health and direction of their chosen field.

> **“I didn’t realize my major had such different salaries by location,”** said Jordan, a computer science student. **“It helped me decide where to target my applications.”**

**Career Context Without the Noise**

Instead of requiring students to search for updates themselves, the Career Center aggregates news and developments relevant to a user’s job category or major. The goal: to help applicants stay informed about the industries they hope to enter, without asking them to sift through dozens of newsletters, feeds or reports.

**Lowering the Barrier for Students Without Résumés**

Recognizing that many students have not yet built a formal résumé, QuickTakes allows users to upload a simple PDF outlining their major and any work, volunteer or project experience. The AI fills in the gaps and delivers targeted job matches regardless of résumé polish.

**A Shift in How Students Approach Early Career Steps**

Career specialists say tools like this could help level the playing field for students who lack professional networks or guidance.

Early data from QuickTakes suggests the tool significantly reduces the time students spend searching for roles each week. Company leadership says the goal is not only to simplify the job hunt but to give students a clearer sense of direction at a time when the pathway from education to employment is often daunting.

“Students are told to ‘go figure it out,’ but the process is full of friction,” said Chen. “Your future shouldn’t hinge on how much time you can spend doom-scrolling for jobs. It should hinge on opportunity.”

With the Career Center now live, QuickTakes says it’s focusing on expanding role coverage, deepening industry insights and building tools that support students well beyond the application stage.
