For college students, finals season is always around the corner, regardless of whether your school runs on semesters, trimesters, or quarters. As a senior at Stanford University, I’ve been through the ups and downs of this process more than a few times, and I’ve learned that a little preparation can make a huge difference in how finals go. Here are my tips to make this intense season more manageable and maybe even a little bit less stressful.

**1\. Do Not, I repeat, Do Not Procrastinate**

Now, I know this may be something that you hear all the time, but you will hear it again from me. Trust me, I used to be the worst procrastinator. I would wait until the day a paper was due to write it and once for a computer science class, I waited until the night before to review the lectures for an exam. And I would like to say that I got an A on those papers and passed that exam, but I did not. It wasn’t until I took time to plan my prep for finals that I began to get straight A’s again. Therefore, I will say it again: DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Use this blog as your guide to begin preparing today!

**2\. Map Out Your Timeline Early**

It might sound simple, but creating a finals timeline (or calendar) is powerful. Mark down every exam and project due date, then work backward to plan out your study schedule. Personally, I start this a month out, dedicating specific days to review materials, re-reading any novels for papers, and practice exams. This helps me visualize everything at once, so nothing sneaks up on me.

**3\. Divide and Conquer Your Study Materials**

Breaking down what you need to study is crucial. Let’s say you’re tackling subjects with dense reading lists or cumulative exams. Split each topic into digestible parts and focus on one at a time, instead of cramming everything at once. I find that dedicating specific days or even just hours to each topic lets me build a more solid understanding without feeling overwhelmed. You can do the same thing when it comes to writing a term paper; set out specific days and times to free-write and eventually edit/revise.

**4\. Prioritize Active Study Methods**

Passive reading isn’t going to cut it when finals come around. Try using active study techniques: quiz yourself, teach the material to a friend, or create a study guide. There are many applications that are free online to help with these (like QuickTakes!!). These methods reinforce the information in a way that sticks, and they help identify areas where you might need extra review. I always find that explaining concepts or reading especially dense material out loud is especially useful—my roommates might think I’m talking to myself, but it’s worth it!

**5\. Find Study Spaces That Work for You**

When you’re preparing for finals, the environment matters. If you’re someone who thrives in quiet spaces, hit up the library. If you need a bit of background noise, try a café. I like to mix it up between my dorm room and a few quiet spots on campus, just to keep the monotony at bay. Having a designated study space helps me switch into “focus mode” more easily. If you feel more productive with others around, consider inviting them to your favorite study spots!

**6\. Keep a Consistent Sleep Schedule**

Finals often bring late nights, but pulling all-nighters isn’t a sustainable way to prepare. Studies show that a steady sleep schedule helps with memory and focus. I always aim for at least seven hours of sleep during finals—your brain needs rest to function at its best, especially when you’re packing in so much information.

**7\. Take Breaks and Recharge**

Studying for long stretches can lead to burnout. Breaks are essential to let your brain rest and reset. Whether it’s a walk outside, a workout, or even just a quick coffee break, giving yourself time to recharge will help you come back with a fresh mind. When I’m preparing for finals, I like to reward myself with small breaks throughout the day—it makes studying feel less intense. If you think you need a whole evening to reset, then don’t be afraid to take the night off!

**8\. Stay Flexible and Kind to Yourself**

Not every study plan goes perfectly, and that’s okay. Finals are challenging, but they’re not everything. If things don’t go as expected or you need to adjust your plan, go easy on yourself and focus on what’s achievable. As a senior, I’ve realized that a balanced approach and keeping a sense of perspective make a huge difference.

Finals are a big deal, but with a little preparation and the right mindset, they don’t have to be overwhelming. By planning ahead, using effective study techniques, and making time to recharge, you’ll set yourself up for success without burning out. Good luck!
