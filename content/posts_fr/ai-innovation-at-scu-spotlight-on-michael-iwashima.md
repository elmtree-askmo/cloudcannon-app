Artificial intelligence isn’t just for the biggest and baddest of the tech world. It’s becoming an everyday tool, an endless dictionary of knowledge that is always at our fingertips. College students in particular have a unique opportunity to harness the power of AI for their studies and impending careers. QuickTakes recently had the pleasure of interviewing a junior from Santa Clara University (SCU), Michael Iwashima, who has been a trailblazer in fostering AI education and real-world applications on his campus through the AI Collaborate club. Read on to learn more about Michael, AI Collaborate, and his thoughts on the future of AI .

Michael didn’t anticipate his passion for AI before starting a research position he landed with a SCU professor. While he had been gradually familiarizing himself with the concept of it through Youtube videos, he had yet to learn *how* to really use AI or to code with it. His research, which focused on using AI to create a replacement for antibiotics, sparked his interest in diving deeper into how AI can be applied to everyday problems. As a bioengineering major, his interest post-college nestles well into his degree and curiosity around AI. Michael hopes to someday work on brain-computer interfaces, similar to cutting-edge companies such as Neuralink.

After concluding his research, Michael was inspired to look around his campus for an AI club where he could explore and learn more. While SCU offers courses on AI, practical application in real-world scenarios remained a gap that Michael sought to fill - thus was born AI Collaborate. Since their inception in Spring of 2022, they’ve grown from only 6 to nearly 200 members. Students get to learn from guest speakers, collaborate on projects, and explore further learning opportunities through platforms such as Kaggle. Michael detailed a few projects in process this last year, one being a robot homework assistant that helps students stay focused. [Dr. Maria Kyrarini](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/kyrarini-maria/), a professor and pioneer in human-machine interaction research, advises the club and occasionally assists in student-led projects.

When asked about his opinions regarding AI’s impact on education, Michael shared some thoughts that rang true to us and our mission at QuickTakes. He’s very optimistic about AI’s potential impact on students, and thinks that an amazing opportunity lies ahead to truly customize learning to each individual. While many college students are just 1 of 50 or sometimes hundreds in a class, AI can address them all as 1 of 1. Catering to individual learning styles and needs will cultivate curiosity amongst students and peak interest in learning instead of just going through the motions. While widespread access to AI does create the opportunity for people to do work that isn’t theirs, that should start the conversation about what type of work should be given in the first place. Michael thinks, ‘maybe work shouldn’t be given unless it really resonates with the student’. While to some that may feel like a far-out idea, this could be another avenue where AI fills in the gaps. If we can one day cater learning to each individual, could we not cater the types of assessments that they do, to what will truly test their knowledge and turn them into a true learner, not just a test taker?

AI Collaborate’s journey at SCU is a testament to the power of curiosity and the drive to fill educational gaps. Many students are seeking to take AI deeper than using chatGPT as the new Google - they seek to leverage the power of machine learning to change the world. Will we much longer have a tolerance for human error when perfect robots exist? Will education as we know it be upended and rewritten? What will happen to the workforce, to our jobs? All questions yet to be answered - though thinkers like Michael are sure to stay ahead of the curve and learn how to adapt to the seemingly endless changes coming our way.
