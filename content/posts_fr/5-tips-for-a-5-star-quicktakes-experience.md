Hey, QuickTaker! We’re happy to have you, and excited to teach you more about the world of AI in education. We know AI is a new and exciting, but also sometimes daunting tool. Learning the ins and outs of rapidly changing technology can make people turn back towards the traditional. But rest assured that there are many apps, like QuickTakes, that make AI an easily-learnable, user-friendly experience.

Since our launch in late 2023, we’ve disrupted the way students and educators alike have thought about note taking and studying as a whole. Our AI-powered platform not only transcribes your live or pre-recorded lectures, but also Youtube videos & PDF documents. Cue the….\*but wait, there’s more\*... infomercial moment. In addition to a full transcript, you get a variety of study materials within minutes, including an outline, practice problems, flashcards, an AI chatbot, and more. So here’s where we arrive at the question: how do I make the most of my QuickTakes experience?

### **Record a Sufficient Length**

When using live audio recordings to create your QuickTake, you should have 5 or more minutes in length to give the AI sufficient content to process your study materials. Oftentimes, users will try out our app by doing a ‘Testing… 1, 2, 3’ into the mic. This will inevitably return an error, as the recording is too short in length. So leave the heavy lifting and long lectures to us - go ahead and hit record!

### **Make Use of All of the Study Material**

QuickTakes generates a lot of study material for you! While it may be overwhelming upon first glance, we recommend that you start familiarizing yourself with the various tabs and see where QuickTakes can help you save time. Instead of making your own flashcard deck, utilize our flashcard feature! Spending hours creating your own study guide from your notes? Try ours out to learn key terms, review core concepts, and more. Missed something your professor said during class? Know that our transcript has you covered with every word. The cherry on top - our AI chatbot who is there for you 24/7 to answer lecture-specific questions.

### **Too Much Background Noise**

Even though AI is realllyyyy smart, it can only encounter so many obstacles. When it comes to live or pre-recorded audio/video files, competing sound plays a big role in the success of your QuickTake. Think about it like this: you’re trying to write down everything the professor says; how will you be most likely to do this? <br>A) Listening to the professor in a silent room.<br>B) Listening to the professor in a room where 2 people are having a conversation, the person next to you is whispering in your ear, and there is construction going on outside.

I can tell you that AI will choose option A. So try and help your virtual sidekick succeed by recording as close to the speaker as possible, and eliminating interfering background noise whenever you can.

### **Personalize Your Study Materials**

Did you know that all of your QuickTakes can be edited by you? Highlight to your heart’s galore, insert equations or photos, add in your own additional notes - the possibilities are endless. No more copy and pasting back and forth from doc to doc. Have all your notes compiled in one place, easily organized and personalized to your learning needs.

### **Share with Your Classmates or Colleagues**

By now, you’re loving QuickTakes. Glad we’re on the same page. So share us with your friends, classmates, and colleagues! Did you attend a lecture or meeting that someone else missed? Share the full transcript with them within the touch of a button. Want to export your study materials to your Google Drive? Done in the blink of an eye. Everyone should be able to study smarter, and learn better (with QuickTakes)!
