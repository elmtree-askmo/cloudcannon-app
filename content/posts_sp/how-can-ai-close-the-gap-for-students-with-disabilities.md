In the present day, learning disabilities are not a new phenomenon for universities and educators worldwide, but artificial intelligence (AI) still relatively is. With many colleges long utilizing physical notetakers or long-standing closed-captioning software, disabilities student centers are now turning to emerging AI companies as a way to bridge the learning gap for students with disabilities.

With 1 in 5 undergraduate students having a disability \[[1](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=60)\], but only 37% of them actually reporting it to their college \[[2](https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/4_26_2022.asp)\], there is a desperate need for accessible and inclusive technology in and outside of campus disability centers. Below, QuickTakes will explore some of the core AI capabilities that have the potential to help level the educational playing field for students around the world.

### **Notetaking / Transcription**

Physical notetakers have been the longstanding method for helping students with ADHD, dyslexia, and more. But it likely doesn’t come as a surprise that relying on humans means relying on perfect attendance to class, decipherable handwriting, quality all-encompassing notes - leaving much room for human error. Enter: AI. Various platforms have emerged that use speech to text transcription to produce accurate lecture notes for students who struggle to pay attention during class. For students, this may not only be a ‘gamechanger’, but indeed a ‘lifesaver’, enabling them to finally get detailed notes that capture their professor’s lecture from start to finish.

### **Live Captioning**

While closed-captioning has long been utilized by disability services, its reliance on completed recordings often limits its usefulness to students during their live class sessions. AI has revolutionized real-time transcription so deaf and hard-of-hearing students are able to see captions for live videos, enabling them to actively engage in classroom discussions and follow along seamlessly with their peers. While a seemingly simple development, live captioning levels the playing field for students with disabilities, fostering deeper comprehension and enhancing their overall learning experience.

### **Text to Speech**

Text-to-speech AI capabilities offer invaluable support to students with visual impairments, providing them with access to content in a format that is the most digestible for them. Since visually impaired students often have difficulties reading textbooks, seeing slides in class, and engaging with online resources assigned by their professors, verbal transcription enables them to engage with all class resources. Another key feature of text-to-speech tools is the ability to customize reading speeds and voice preferences, allowing students to tailor the experience to their individual needs, thus increasing their confidence and overall academic autonomy.

### **Targeted Study Materials**

While custom study materials are a newer development in the disabilities services field, they are an invaluable one. A CDC study showed that 1 in 54 8-year old children have autism \[[3](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/an-easy-read-summary.html)\], a neurodevelopmental condition categorized by difficulties with social interaction and communication. While on a high level, this may not be inherently associated with studying, on a micro level, we see that a majority of students rely upon study groups, office hours, and overall peer-to-peer interaction to help them thrive in school and their studies. For students that struggle with social interaction, many of these commonly utilized options may feel daunting or completely undoable. Using products like QuickTakes, students can have lecture-specific study materials generated within minutes, and even the option to utilize an AI chatbot to ask questions to in lieu of going to office hours. It must be noted that these apps don’t aim to replace talking to professors or TAs altogether, but instead offer more accessible options for students that may choose to not ask questions due to anxiety or learning disabilities.

The acknowledgement and accommodation of physical and learning disabilities has long been part of the discourse in higher education. However, there is still much work to be done, given that anywhere between 15-43% of students who report their disability don’t receive accommodations from their school \[[4](https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/4_26_2022.asp)\]. The recent advancements in AI offer promising potential to aid disability support services in closing this accessibility gap for students. The momentum in the last few years as AI becomes more commonplace in society signals a palpable shift in learning environments. From transcription services to targeted study materials, students are already harnessing the power of AI on their own, and it’s up to their universities to follow suit.
