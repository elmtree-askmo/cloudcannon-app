    How does a hypothesis differ from a prediction in scientific research?
answer: >-
    In scientific research, a hypothesis and a prediction serve distinct but interconnected roles within the scientific method.\n\n1. **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a tentative, testable explanation for a specific observation or phenomenon. It is formulated based on prior knowledge, observations, and background research. A good hypothesis is characterized by its ability to be tested through experimentation and is often framed in a way that allows for falsification. For example, if a researcher observes that plants in sunlight grow taller than those in the shade, they might hypothesize that "increased sunlight exposure leads to greater plant growth."\n\n2. **Prediction**: A prediction, on the other hand, is a specific statement that forecasts the outcome of an experiment based on the hypothesis. It is derived from the hypothesis and outlines what the researcher expects to observe if the hypothesis is correct. Continuing with the previous example, the prediction might be, "If plants are exposed to more sunlight, then they will grow at least 20% taller than those kept in the shade after four weeks."\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that a hypothesis provides a broader explanation for an observation, while a prediction specifies the expected results of testing that hypothesis. The hypothesis guides the research, and the prediction helps in designing the experiment to test the hypothesis.
