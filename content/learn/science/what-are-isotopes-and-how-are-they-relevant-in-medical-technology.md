    What are isotopes, and how are they relevant in medical technology?
answer: >-
    Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons, leading to variations in their atomic masses. For example, carbon has several isotopes, including carbon-12 (with 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (with 8 neutrons). While carbon-12 is stable, carbon-14 is radioactive and decays over time.\n\nIn medical technology, isotopes play a crucial role, particularly in the fields of medical imaging and treatment. Here are some key applications:\n\n1. **Medical Imaging**: Radioactive isotopes are used in various imaging techniques, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. In this process, a patient is administered a radioactive tracer that emits positrons. When these positrons encounter electrons in the body, they annihilate each other, producing gamma rays that can be detected by the imaging equipment. This allows for detailed visualization of metabolic processes and can help in diagnosing conditions like cancer.\n\n2. **Radiotherapy**: Certain isotopes are used in the treatment of cancer. For instance, iodine-131 is used to treat thyroid cancer. The radioactive iodine is absorbed by the thyroid gland, where it emits radiation that destroys cancerous cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: Isotopes are also used in various diagnostic tests. For example, technetium-99m is widely used in nuclear medicine for imaging bones, organs, and tissues. Its short half-life makes it ideal for diagnostic purposes, as it minimizes the patient's exposure to radiation.\n\n4. **Research**: Isotopes are used in biological and medical research to trace the pathways of substances in biological systems, helping scientists understand metabolic processes and the effects of drugs.\n\nIn summary, isotopes are not only fundamental to understanding atomic structure and stability but also have significant practical applications in medical technology, enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in healthcare.
