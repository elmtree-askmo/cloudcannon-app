    Differentiate between acidic and basic R-groups.
answer: >-
    To differentiate between acidic and basic R-groups in amino acids, we can look at their chemical properties and behaviors:\n\n### Acidic R-Groups\n- **Charge**: Acidic R-groups are negatively charged at physiological pH (around 7.4). This is because they contain carboxyl groups (-COOH) that can donate protons (H+), resulting in a negatively charged carboxylate ion (-COO⁻).\n- **Examples**: Common amino acids with acidic R-groups include aspartic acid (Asp, D) and glutamic acid (Glu, E).\n- **Function**: The negative charge of acidic R-groups allows them to participate in ionic interactions with positively charged molecules, which can be crucial for enzyme activity and protein stability.\n\n### Basic R-Groups\n- **Charge**: Basic R-groups are positively charged at physiological pH. They typically contain amino groups (-NH2) that can accept protons, resulting in a positively charged ammonium ion (-NH3⁺).\n- **Examples**: Common amino acids with basic R-groups include lysine (Lys, K), arginine (Arg, R), and histidine (His, H).\n- **Function**: The positive charge of basic R-groups enables them to interact with negatively charged molecules, contributing to the overall stability and functionality of proteins.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Acidic R-groups**: Negatively charged, act as proton donors, and include amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid.\n- **Basic R-groups**: Positively charged, act as proton acceptors, and include amino acids like lysine, arginine, and histidine.\n\nThese differences in charge and behavior are essential for the interactions that occur within proteins, influencing their structure, stability, and biological functions.
