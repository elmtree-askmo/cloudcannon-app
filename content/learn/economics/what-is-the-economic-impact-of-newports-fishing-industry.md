    What is the economic impact of Newport's fishing industry?
answer: >-
    The economic impact of Newport's fishing industry is significant, contributing to both local income and employment. According to the "Fishing Industry Economic Activity Trends in the Newport, Oregon Area" report, commissioned by the Lincoln County Commission and the Midwater Trawlers Cooperative, the fishing industry in Newport has shown a growing impact on the area's economy.\n\nIn 2019, the total income generated from the fishing industry, including direct income and related marine activities, was approximately $346 million. This figure encompasses both commercial and recreational fishing sectors. Specifically, the commercial fishing industry alone contributed an estimated $155 million in income, supporting around 3,300 jobs and generating an output of $328 million in the local economy. Additionally, marine recreational fishing, which includes activities such as finfish and crabbing, contributed about $21 million in income and supported 444 jobs, with an output of $57 million.\n\nNewport is home to the largest commercial fishing fleet and the most active recreational marina on the Oregon Coast, underscoring its central role in the state's fishing industry. The report highlights that the top 47 vessels, which represent only 14% of the fleet, accounted for 67% of the total onshore harvest value in 2019, indicating a concentration of economic activity among a smaller number of high-revenue vessels.\n\nOverall, the fishing industry in Newport not only provides substantial economic benefits but also plays a crucial role in the community's identity and sustainability. The ongoing efforts to understand and enhance this sector are vital for maintaining its contributions to the local economy.
