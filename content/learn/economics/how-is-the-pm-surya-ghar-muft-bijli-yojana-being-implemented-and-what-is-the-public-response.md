    How is the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana being implemented and what is the public response?
answer: >-
    The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is a significant initiative launched by the Government of India on February 13, 2024, aimed at promoting the use of solar energy among residential households. The scheme is designed to provide free electricity to one crore households that opt to install rooftop solar electricity units, allowing them to receive up to 300 units of electricity free each month. The total outlay for the scheme is Rs 75,021 crore, and it is set to be implemented until March 31, 2027.\n\nThe implementation of the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is overseen by a National Programme Implementation Agency (NPIA). The project has a maximum duration of 18 months, with the possibility of extension or reduction based on the Selection Committee's decisions. The guidelines for the scheme stipulate that all applications received on the National Portal from the launch date will be considered for Central Financial Assistance.\n\nPublic response to the scheme has been overwhelmingly positive. As of now, more than 25 lakh households have applied for rooftop solar installations under the scheme. However, it is noted that only about 23.8% of these applications have been approved so far. This indicates a significant interest in the program, with 18 lakh applications already approved for subsidies since its launch.\n\nThe PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is seen as a transformative step towards sustainable energy and economic empowerment in India, as it not only aims to reduce household electricity costs but also contributes to the broader goal of enhancing renewable energy capacity in the country.
