    What are the different types of FDI?
answer: >-
    Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can be categorized into several distinct types, each reflecting different strategies and objectives of the investing entities. The main types of FDI include:\n\n1. **Horizontal FDI**: This is the most common type of FDI, where a company invests in a foreign company that operates in the same industry as the investor. The goal is to replicate the business model in a different country. For example, a fast-food chain opening a new outlet in another country is engaging in horizontal FDI.\n\n2. **Vertical FDI**: In this type, a company invests in a foreign company that operates at a different stage of the production process. This can be further divided into two subcategories:\n   - **Backward Vertical FDI**: This occurs when a company invests in a foreign supplier to secure the supply of raw materials.\n   - **Forward Vertical FDI**: This happens when a company invests in a foreign distributor to gain better access to the market.\n\n3. **Conglomerate FDI**: This type involves investing in a foreign company that operates in a completely different industry. The primary motivation is diversification and risk reduction. For instance, a technology firm investing in a foreign food processing company would be an example of conglomerate FDI.\n\n4. **Platform FDI**: This occurs when a business expands into a foreign country to manufacture products that are then exported to a third country. An example would be a company setting up a manufacturing facility in one country to produce goods for sale in another market.\n\nThese types of FDI reflect the various strategies companies use to expand their operations internationally, each with its own implications for market entry, risk management, and operational control.
