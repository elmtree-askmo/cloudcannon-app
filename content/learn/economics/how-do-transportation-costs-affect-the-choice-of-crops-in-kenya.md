    How do transportation costs affect the choice of crops in Kenya?
answer: >-
    Transportation costs significantly influence the choice of crops in Kenya, primarily by affecting farmers' access to markets and the profitability of different agricultural products. High transportation costs can deter farmers from engaging in market transactions, leading them to focus on low-yielding food crops for subsistence rather than more profitable cash crops. This phenomenon is particularly evident in rural areas where logistical inefficiencies are prevalent.\n\nResearch indicates that transportation costs account for a substantial portion of final market prices—currently around 28%—and reducing these costs could enhance farmers' profits and lower consumer prices. For instance, improving logistics efficiency could potentially save up to US$1.6 billion, which would have a direct impact on the types of crops that farmers choose to cultivate. If transportation costs were reduced to 13%, it would allow farmers to consider a wider range of crops that may have previously been unviable due to high transport expenses.\n\nMoreover, the Von Thünen model of agricultural land use illustrates how distance from markets influences agricultural decisions. According to this model, as the distance from the market increases, the type of crops grown tends to shift from high-value, perishable goods to lower-value, more durable crops. In Kenya, this means that farmers located further from urban centers may be more inclined to grow staple foods rather than cash crops, which require timely market access to be profitable.\n\nIn summary, transportation costs play a critical role in shaping agricultural choices in Kenya, affecting not only the types of crops that farmers decide to grow but also their overall economic viability and market participation. Improving transportation infrastructure and reducing costs could lead to a more diverse and profitable agricultural sector.
