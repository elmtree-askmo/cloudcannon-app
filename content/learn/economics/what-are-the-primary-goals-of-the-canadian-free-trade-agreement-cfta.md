    What are the primary goals of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)?
answer: >-
    The primary goals of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), which took effect on July 1, 2017, are centered around enhancing trade and economic cooperation among Canadian provinces and territories. The key objectives include:\n\n1. **Reduction of Trade Barriers**: The CFTA aims to reduce and eliminate barriers to the free movement of goods, services, and investments within Canada. This includes addressing regulatory obstacles that may hinder trade between provinces and territories.\n\n2. **Facilitation of Economic Mobility**: The agreement seeks to promote the free movement of persons, allowing for greater economic mobility across the country. This is intended to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce development.\n\n3. **Alignment with International Commitments**: The CFTA is designed to better align with Canada's commitments under international trade agreements, such as the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). This alignment helps reduce compliance costs for Canadian firms operating both domestically and internationally.\n\n4. **Support for Public Policy Objectives**: While promoting trade, the CFTA preserves the ability of governments to implement their own laws and regulations to achieve public policy objectives, including public health, safety, consumer protection, and the promotion of cultural diversity.\n\n5. **Framework for Collaboration**: The CFTA establishes a framework for collaboration among federal, provincial, and territorial governments to develop trade policies that support economic growth, workers, and local communities.\n\nOverall, the CFTA is intended to create a more integrated and efficient internal market in Canada, fostering economic growth and enhancing the competitiveness of Canadian businesses.
