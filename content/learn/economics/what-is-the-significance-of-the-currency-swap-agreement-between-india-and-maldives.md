    What is the significance of the Currency Swap Agreement between India and Maldives?
answer: >-
    The Currency Swap Agreement between India and the Maldives, signed on October 7, 2024, is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Financial Support**: The agreement allows the Maldives to access up to $400 million through the US Dollar/Euro Swap Window and â‚¹30 billion (approximately $357 million) via the Indian Rupee (INR) Swap Window. This financial assistance is crucial for the Maldives, especially as the country faces a foreign currency crunch and declining foreign exchange reserves.\n\n2. **Economic Stability**: By providing this financial lifeline, India aims to help the Maldives stabilize its economy and avoid potential debt defaults. The agreement is part of India's broader strategy to strengthen economic ties with its neighboring countries and support regional stability.\n\n3. **SAARC Framework**: The agreement is made under the SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027, which was established to provide short-term foreign exchange liquidity to member countries. This framework enhances regional cooperation and economic integration among South Asian nations.\n\n4. **Bilateral Relations**: The signing of this agreement follows high-level talks between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu, indicating a commitment to strengthening bilateral relations. It reflects India's role as a key partner in the Maldives' economic development and security.\n\n5. **Long-term Validity**: The agreement is valid until June 18, 2027, providing a longer-term assurance of financial support, which can help the Maldives plan its economic strategies more effectively.\n\nIn summary, the Currency Swap Agreement is a strategic move that not only aids the Maldives in addressing its immediate financial challenges but also reinforces the diplomatic and economic ties between India and the Maldives.
