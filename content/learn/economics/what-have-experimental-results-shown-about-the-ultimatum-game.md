    The Ultimatum Game (UG) is a widely studied experimental design in the field of economics and social sciences, introduced by Werner GÃ¼th and colleagues in 1982. It involves two players: the proposer, who suggests a division of a fixed sum of money (the "pie"), and the responder, who can either accept or reject the offer. If the responder accepts, the proposed split is implemented; if they reject it, neither player receives anything.\n\nExperimental results from a meta-analysis of 37 studies with 75 results indicate that, on average, proposers offer about 40% of the pie to responders. This finding highlights a significant deviation from the predictions of classical economic theory, which would suggest that proposers should offer the minimum possible amount to maximize their own payoff.\n\nThe Ultimatum Game has been noted for its ability to reveal the importance of non-monetary factors in decision-making, such as fairness, social preferences, and emotions. For instance, offers tend to cluster around equal splits, suggesting that proposers are motivated by a sense of fairness rather than pure self-interest. Additionally, the game has shown substantial variability in outcomes based on cultural and demographic factors. For example, offers in the United States tend to be higher than those in Japan, while Israel shows offers that are higher than both.\n\nThe Ultimatum Game serves as a key example of how human behavior often deviates from the "rational" strategies predicted by traditional game theory. It illustrates that individuals consider not only their own payoffs but also the fairness of the offers made, which can lead to rejections of low offers even at a cost to themselves. This behavior underscores the role of social norms and expectations in economic interactions.\n\nOverall, the Ultimatum Game has become a paradigmatic experiment in behavioral economics, providing insights into human decision-making processes and the complexities of social interactions.
