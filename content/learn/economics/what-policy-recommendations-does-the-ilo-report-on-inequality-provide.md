    What policy recommendations does the ILO report on inequality provide?
answer: >-
    The International Labour Organization (ILO) report on inequality provides several key policy recommendations aimed at addressing persistent wage disparities and promoting a more equitable labor market. Here are the main recommendations highlighted in the report:\n\n1. **Strengthening Wage Policies**: The ILO emphasizes the need for stronger national wage policies that can help ensure fair compensation for workers across all income levels, particularly focusing on those in low-income and informal sector jobs.\n\n2. **Inclusive Economic Growth Strategies**: The report advocates for the development of national strategies that prioritize inclusive economic growth. This involves creating an environment where all workers can benefit from economic advancements, thereby reducing wage inequality.\n\n3. **Social Investments**: The ILO calls for increased social investments in education and health. This is crucial for reversing decades of under-investment in these areas, which can help improve the overall quality of the workforce and reduce income disparities.\n\n4. **Fiscal Policies**: It is recommended that fiscal policies be designed to address inequalities while avoiding exacerbating inflationary pressures. This includes measures that can help rebuild economic buffers to support living standards.\n\n5. **Collective Bargaining and Freedom of Association**: The report stresses the importance of promoting freedom of association and collective bargaining as essential tools for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions.\n\n6. **Addressing Informal Employment**: Given that a significant portion of workers in low- and middle-income countries are self-employed and often work in the informal economy, the ILO suggests policies that can help transition these workers into formal employment, thereby improving their wage conditions.\n\nThese recommendations aim to create a more equitable global labor market and address the ongoing challenges of wage inequality, particularly in low-income countries where disparities are most pronounced.
