    What is India's position on fisheries subsidies at the World Trade Organization (WTO)?
answer: >-
    India's position on fisheries subsidies at the World Trade Organization (WTO) is characterized by a strong emphasis on sustainability and the protection of its artisanal fishing community. During the recent negotiations at the Abu Dhabi Ministerial Conference-13, India reiterated its commitment to responsible and sustainable fishing practices, which are deeply rooted in the traditions of its diverse fishing communities.\n\nIndia has highlighted that it is one of the lowest subsidizers in the fisheries sector, despite having a large population dependent on fishing. The country has called for a moratorium on subsidies provided by Distant Water Fishing Nations for activities beyond their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) for a period of at least 25 years. This request reflects India's concern that such subsidies could exacerbate unsustainable fishing practices and threaten the livelihoods of small-scale fishers in developing countries.\n\nFurthermore, India has expressed its apprehensions regarding the WTO Agreement on Fisheries, which it views as potentially unjust and detrimental to the interests of fishers in developing nations. The country has urged other developing countries to unite in ensuring that the agreement does not impose unfair burdens on them.\n\nOverall, India's stance balances the need for sectoral growth with the welfare of its artisanal fishers, advocating for measures that protect local fishing communities while addressing the challenges posed by industrial fishing practices.
