    What are the recommendations for improving tax devolution to address VFI?
answer: >-
    To address the issue of Vertical Fiscal Imbalance (VFI) in India, several recommendations have been proposed, particularly in the context of the upcoming 16th Finance Commission (FC16). Here are the key recommendations aimed at improving tax devolution:\n\n1. **Increase Tax Devolution**: One of the primary recommendations is to raise the share of taxes allocated to states from the current levels to 49%. This increase would help reduce the financial dependency of states on the Union government and enable them to better meet their expenditure needs.\n\n2. **Modify Tax Devolution Criteria**: The Finance Commission should consider revising the criteria for tax devolution to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources among states. This would involve targeting the inter-state distribution of transfers more effectively, taking into account the unique needs and circumstances of different states.\n\n3. **Empower Local Governments**: Strengthening the financial autonomy of local governments can also play a crucial role in addressing VFI. By empowering local bodies with greater revenue-generating capabilities, the reliance on state and central transfers can be reduced.\n\n4. **Restructure Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)**: Reforms should focus on restructuring CSS to ensure that they are more aligned with the fiscal capacities of states. This would help in reducing the financial burden on states and allow for better allocation of resources.\n\n5. **Address Goods and Services Tax (GST) Issues**: The implementation of GST has been a significant factor in the fiscal landscape. Addressing the challenges and inefficiencies related to GST can enhance the revenue base for states, thereby mitigating VFI.\n\n6. **Promote Fiscal Consolidation**: The Finance Commission should recommend measures for fiscal consolidation that encourage states to improve their revenue collection and expenditure management practices.\n\nThese recommendations aim to create a more balanced fiscal framework that enhances the financial independence of states, thereby addressing the challenges posed by VFI and promoting effective governance and public service delivery.
