    How is Pareto Efficiency determined in game theory?
answer: >-
    In game theory, Pareto efficiency, also known as Pareto optimality, is a crucial concept used to evaluate the outcomes of strategic interactions among players. An allocation of resources is considered Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation that can make at least one player better off without making at least one other player worse off. This means that once an outcome is reached, any attempt to improve the situation for one player would necessarily harm another player.\n\nTo determine whether an allocation is Pareto efficient, one can ask whether there exists any alternative allocation that would result in a Pareto improvement. A Pareto improvement occurs when at least one individual’s payoff increases while no one else’s payoff decreases. If no such alternative exists, the current allocation is deemed Pareto efficient.\n\nFormally, an outcome $ z' $ Pareto dominates another outcome $ z $ if the payoffs for all players in $ z' $ are greater than or equal to those in $ z $, with at least one player receiving a strictly higher payoff. An outcome $ z $ is Pareto efficient if it is not Pareto dominated by any other outcome $ z' $.\n\nIn summary, Pareto efficiency is determined by evaluating whether it is possible to reallocate resources in a way that improves at least one player's situation without negatively impacting others. This concept is fundamental in analyzing the effectiveness of resource allocation in various strategic settings, including economics and social dilemmas.
