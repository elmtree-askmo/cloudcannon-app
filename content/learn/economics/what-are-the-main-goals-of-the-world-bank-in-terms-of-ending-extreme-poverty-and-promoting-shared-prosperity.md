    What are the main goals of the World Bank in terms of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity?
answer: >-
    The World Bank has established two primary goals aimed at addressing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, which are crucial for global economic development and social equity.\n\n1. **Ending Extreme Poverty**: The World Bank aims to reduce the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 a day to no more than 3% of the global population by 2030. This goal reflects the Bank's commitment to eradicating deep poverty, which affects over 1 billion people worldwide. The World Bank considers this situation morally unacceptable given the available resources and technology. By focusing on this target, the Bank seeks to galvanize international and national efforts to eliminate extreme poverty within a generation.\n\n2. **Promoting Shared Prosperity**: The second goal of the World Bank is to promote "shared prosperity," which involves fostering sustainable income growth for the bottom 40% of the population in each country. This goal recognizes that economic growth should benefit all segments of society, not just the privileged few. By enhancing the living standards of the poorer segments, the World Bank aims to reduce inequality and social exclusion, which often accompany rising prosperity.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the World Bank provides financial resources, technical assistance, and policy advice to developing countries. This includes low-interest loans, zero-interest credits, and grants aimed at supporting economic development in areas such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and private-sector development. The World Bank also emphasizes the importance of investing in human capital to create a better society and economy, which is essential for long-term poverty reduction and economic stability.\n\nIn summary, the World Bank's main goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity are interconnected and reflect a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of life for the world's most vulnerable populations.
