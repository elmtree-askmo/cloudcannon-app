    What economic policies and reforms have been implemented in Sri Lanka to address the crisis?
answer: >-
    Sri Lanka has been navigating a significant economic crisis that began in 2019 and escalated dramatically in 2022, leading to a contraction of 8.7% in GDP. In response to this crisis, the government has implemented several economic policies and reforms aimed at stabilization and recovery.\n\n1. **Debt Restructuring**: A critical component of Sri Lanka's recovery strategy involves restructuring its unsustainable debt, which exceeded $83 billion, with a significant portion owed to foreign creditors. The government has been engaged in negotiations with international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to facilitate this process.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy Adjustments**: The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has made significant cuts to policy rates, reducing the Standing Deposit Facility rate to 11% and the Standing Lending Facility rate to 12% by mid-2023. These measures aim to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment.\n\n3. **Fiscal Policy Reforms**: Despite an increase in the overall fiscal deficit due to rising interest payments, the government has focused on enhancing domestic revenue mobilization. This includes efforts to improve tax collection and reduce unnecessary expenditures to stabilize the fiscal situation.\n\n4. **Promotion of Exports and Tourism**: To address the current account deficit, the government is working to boost merchandise export earnings and enhance the resilience of the export sector. The recovery of tourism, which is vital for foreign exchange earnings, is also a priority, especially as global travel restrictions ease.\n\n5. **Social Protection Measures**: Recognizing the widespread impact of the crisis on the population, the government has emphasized the importance of social protection programs to support vulnerable groups. This includes ensuring that the benefits of economic recovery are equitably shared among the population.\n\n6. **Investment in Key Sectors**: The government is looking to involve the private sector in various initiatives, including vocational education and infrastructure development, to stimulate job creation and economic growth.\n\n7. **Transparency and Communication**: The Central Bank has committed to improving the transparency and credibility of its monetary policy by publishing bi-annual reports on inflation and economic growth outlooks, which is intended to better inform the public and build confidence in economic management.\n\nOverall, while Sri Lanka's economic policies and reforms are aimed at stabilizing the economy and fostering growth, the country faces significant challenges, including political instability, external financing constraints, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The path to recovery remains complex and requires sustained efforts across multiple fronts.
