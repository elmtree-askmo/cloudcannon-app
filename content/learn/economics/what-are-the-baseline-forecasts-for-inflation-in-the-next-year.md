    What are the baseline forecasts for inflation in the next year?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the baseline forecasts for inflation in the next year (2024) indicate a global inflation rate expected to ease to 6.6%. This is a decrease from previous higher rates, reflecting a trend of moderating inflation as supply chain issues resolve and economic growth slows due to monetary policy tightening. \n\nIn the United States, consumer inflation expectations for the year ahead are steady at around 3%, which aligns with broader trends of declining inflation rates across various sectors, including medical care and housing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), a preferred measure of inflation, has already shown a significant drop from a peak of 7% year-over-year in June 2022 to approximately 3% as of October 2023.\n\nOverall, the forecasts suggest a continued moderation in inflation rates, with expectations for further declines as economic conditions stabilize and supply-side pressures diminish.
