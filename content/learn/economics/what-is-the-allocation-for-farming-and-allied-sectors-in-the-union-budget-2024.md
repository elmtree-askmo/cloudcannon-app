    What is the allocation for farming and allied sectors in the Union Budget 2024?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, the government has allocated ₹1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and allied sectors. This allocation aims to enhance various aspects of agriculture, including research and development (R&D), improving supply chains, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. \n\nThe budget reflects a focus on increasing productivity and resilience in the agricultural sector, with specific initiatives such as the introduction of 109 new high-yielding and climate-resilient varieties of crops. Additionally, the government plans to initiate 1 crore farmers into natural farming, providing them with certification and branding over the next two years.\n\nThe allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare is ₹1.22 trillion, which represents a 5% increase, although this increase is seen as barely offsetting inflation. Furthermore, the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairy has received a significant increase of 27% in its allocation compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\nOverall, the budget aims to bolster the agricultural sector while addressing the challenges faced by farmers and promoting sustainable practices.
