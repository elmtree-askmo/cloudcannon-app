    Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives by comparing estimated costs and benefits. It relates closely to utilitarianism, aiming to maximize overall utility by focusing on outcomes and their impact on well-being, while also facing critiques about capturing qualitative aspects.

    What is cost-benefit analysis and how is it related to utilitarianism?
answer: >-
    Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives in decision-making. It involves comparing the estimated costs and benefits associated with a particular decision, project, or policy to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs. This analysis is crucial for informed decision-making, especially in business and public policy contexts, as it helps assess the financial feasibility of projects and avoid potential losses.\n\nThe relationship between cost-benefit analysis and utilitarianism is significant. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that posits that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, typically defined as that which produces the greatest well-being for the greatest number of people. CBA aligns closely with utilitarian principles, as it seeks to quantify and compare the benefits and costs of different actions or policies to identify the option that maximizes overall utility.\n\nIn essence, CBA can be seen as a practical application of utilitarianism, providing a framework for decision-making that emphasizes the importance of outcomes and their impact on overall happiness or well-being. By relying on a structured analysis of costs and benefits, CBA aims to replace intuitive judgments with a more objective assessment, which is a core tenet of utilitarian thought.\n\nHowever, critiques of utilitarianism also extend to cost-benefit analysis, highlighting limitations such as the potential inadequacy in capturing all relevant costs and benefits, particularly those that are qualitative or difficult to quantify. This raises ethical concerns about the appropriateness of using CBA as a sole decision-making tool, especially in complex moral dilemmas where human values and experiences may not be easily reducible to numerical values.
