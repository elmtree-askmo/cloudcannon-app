    How do libertarians defend their stance against redistribution?
answer: >-
    Libertarians defend their stance against redistribution primarily on the grounds of individual property rights and the belief that coercive redistribution undermines personal responsibility and economic incentives. Here are some key arguments that encapsulate the libertarian perspective on this issue:\n\n1. **Violation of Property Rights**: Libertarians argue that redistributive taxation is a form of coercion that infringes upon individual property rights. They believe that individuals have the right to keep the fruits of their labor and investments, and any attempt by the state to redistribute wealth is seen as a violation of these rights.\n\n2. **Moral Duty vs. Political Obligation**: Philosopher Robert Nozick, a prominent libertarian thinker, posits that while individuals may have a moral duty to help the poor, this duty should be fulfilled through voluntary acts of charity rather than through state-enforced redistribution. He argues that the obligation to assist others does not extend to coercive measures imposed by the government.\n\n3. **Entitlement Theory**: Nozick's entitlement theory outlines principles of justice in acquisition and transfer, asserting that individuals are entitled to their holdings if they have acquired them justly. This theory emphasizes that wealth should not be redistributed unless it is done through voluntary transactions, which aligns with libertarian values of freedom and autonomy.\n\n4. **Consequences of Redistribution**: Libertarians often critique the utilitarian arguments for redistribution, which suggest that it can lead to better overall outcomes by addressing inequalities. They argue that such policies can create disincentives for hard work and innovation, ultimately harming economic progress and individual freedom.\n\n5. **Free Market Advocacy**: Libertarians advocate for a free market as the optimal system for respecting individual freedom and promoting economic growth. They believe that voluntary exchanges and competition in a free market lead to better outcomes for society as a whole, as opposed to government interventions that aim to redistribute wealth.\n\n6. **Justice in Acquisition and Transfer**: Libertarians emphasize the importance of just acquisition and transfer of property. They argue that as long as individuals acquire their holdings through fair means, they have the right to retain them, and any form of redistribution that does not respect these principles is unjust.\n\nIn summary, libertarians maintain that redistribution is not only a violation of individual rights but also counterproductive to the principles of freedom, responsibility, and economic efficiency. They advocate for a system where individuals are free to make their own choices regarding wealth and charity, without coercive interference from the state.
