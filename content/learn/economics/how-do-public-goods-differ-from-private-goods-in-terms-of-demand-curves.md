answer: >-
    Public goods and private goods differ significantly in terms of their demand curves due to their inherent characteristics of excludability and rivalry.\n\n1. **Public Goods**: These goods are characterized by non-excludability and non-rivalry. This means that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using them, and one person's use does not diminish another's ability to use the same good. The demand curve for public goods is derived by vertically summing the individual demand curves of all consumers. This vertical summation reflects the total marginal benefit that all individuals derive from each additional unit of the public good. Therefore, the aggregate demand curve for public goods is a representation of the total willingness to pay for each quantity of the good provided.\n\n2. **Private Goods**: In contrast, private goods are excludable and rivalrous. This means that ownership can restrict access to the good, and one person's consumption of the good reduces the amount available for others. The demand curve for private goods is derived by horizontally summing the individual demand curves. This horizontal summation reflects the total quantity demanded by all consumers at each price level. Essentially, the market demand for private goods is the sum of the quantities that individual consumers are willing to purchase at various prices.\n\nIn summary, the demand curve for public goods is vertical, reflecting the aggregate willingness to pay for each unit, while the demand curve for private goods is horizontal, reflecting the total quantity demanded at each price. This fundamental difference in how demand is aggregated for public versus private goods is crucial for understanding their economic implications and the necessity for government intervention in the provision of public goods.
