    How did the phases of the 2008 International Credit Crisis unfold, and what were the key turning points?
answer: >-
    The 2008 International Credit Crisis unfolded in several distinct phases, marked by key turning points that significantly impacted the global financial landscape. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of these phases and turning points:\n\n1. **Meltdown of the Subprime Mortgage Market (2007)**: The crisis began with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, where banks issued high-risk loans to borrowers with poor credit histories. As defaults surged, the value of mortgage-backed securities plummeted, leading to significant losses for financial institutions.\n\n2. **Spillover into Broader Credit Markets (Early 2008)**: By early 2008, the effects of the subprime crisis began to spill over into broader credit markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that potential losses from the credit crunch could reach $1 trillion, affecting various sectors including commercial property and consumer credit.\n\n3. **Liquidity Crisis (Mid-2008)**: The liquidity crisis intensified, exemplified by the failures of major financial institutions such as Northern Rock and Bear Stearns. The situation escalated in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15, marking a critical turning point. This event triggered panic in the financial markets, leading to a severe tightening of credit and a loss of confidence among investors.\n\n4. **Government Intervention (Late 2008)**: In response to the escalating crisis, the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve implemented significant measures to stabilize the financial system. On September 20, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson submitted a proposal for a $700 billion bailout to Congress. By November 26, the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase $800 billion in mortgage-backed securities to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which helped to calm the markets temporarily.\n\n5. **Global Recession (2008-2009)**: The culmination of these events led to a global recession, with stock markets plunging and economies contracting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) responded by dramatically lowering the federal funds rate to near zero by October 29, 2008, in an effort to stimulate economic activity.\n\nThroughout these phases, the crisis highlighted systemic risks within the financial system, including the interconnectedness of financial institutions and the impact of deregulation. The political repercussions were significant, leading to widespread calls for regulatory reform and changes in financial oversight to prevent future crises.\n\nIn summary, the 2008 International Credit Crisis unfolded through a series of phases characterized by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, a liquidity crisis, significant government intervention, and ultimately, a global recession. Key turning points included the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent government bailouts, which reshaped the financial landscape and prompted a reevaluation of financial regulations.
