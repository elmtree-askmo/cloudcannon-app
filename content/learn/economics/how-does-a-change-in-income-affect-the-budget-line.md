    How does a change in income affect the budget line?
answer: >-
    A change in income significantly affects the budget line in consumer choice theory. The budget line represents all possible combinations of two goods that a consumer can purchase given their income and the prices of those goods.\n\n1. **Increase in Income**: When a consumer's income increases, the budget line shifts outward (to the right) without changing its slope. This outward shift indicates that the consumer can now afford more combinations of the two goods. For example, if a consumer's income rises from $50 to $70 while the prices of the goods remain constant, the new budget line will allow for a greater quantity of both goods to be purchased.\n\n2. **Decrease in Income**: Conversely, if the consumer's income decreases, the budget line shifts inward (to the left). This inward shift signifies that the consumer can afford fewer combinations of the two goods. For instance, if the income drops from $50 to $30, the budget line will reflect a reduced capacity to purchase the same quantities of goods as before.\n\n3. **Parallel Shift**: It is important to note that the slope of the budget line, which is determined by the relative prices of the two goods, remains unchanged when only income changes. Thus, the budget line shifts parallelly, maintaining the same angle but moving to a new position based on the new income level.\n\nIn summary, a change in income results in a parallel shift of the budget line: an increase in income shifts it outward, while a decrease shifts it inward, allowing consumers to adjust their consumption choices accordingly. This dynamic illustrates how income levels directly influence consumer purchasing power and the range of feasible consumption options.
