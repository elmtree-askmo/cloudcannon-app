    Which sectors contributed most to the decline in India's core sector output?
answer: >-
    The decline in India's core sector output in August 2024 was primarily attributed to significant decreases in the production of natural gas and coal. The overall output from the eight core industries fell by 1.8% in August 2024, a stark contrast to the 13.4% growth recorded in August 2023. This marked the first instance of contraction at an aggregate level in 42 months.\n\nWhile natural gas and coal were the main contributors to this decline, it is noteworthy that the steel and fertilizer sectors experienced positive growth during the same period. The core sector's performance for the April-August timeframe stood at a growth rate of 4.6%, indicating some resilience despite the contraction in August.\n\nIn summary, the sectors that contributed most to the decline in India's core sector output were natural gas and coal, while steel and fertilizers showed positive growth amidst the overall downturn.
