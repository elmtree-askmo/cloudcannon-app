Additionally, India has provided substantial financial aid, including budgetary support and currency swap agreements, to help stabilize the Maldivian economy.\n\n6. **Digital and Financial Cooperation**: The two nations are also focusing on enhancing digital and financial cooperation, which is vital for modernizing trade practices and improving economic ties.\n\nOverall, the India-Maldives relationship is characterized by a commitment to expanding trade and economic cooperation, with significant potential for growth in various sectors, including renewable energy and sustainable tourism.
