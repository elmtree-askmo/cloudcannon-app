    What are the potential economic risks of not including undocumented workers in relief programs?
answer: >-
    The potential economic risks of not including undocumented workers in relief programs are significant and multifaceted. A recent study highlighted that the exclusion of undocumented residents and their families from the $1,200 stimulus payments during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a loss of approximately $10 billion in potential economic output. This exclusion not only affects the undocumented workers themselves but also has broader implications for the economy as a whole.\n\n1. **Loss of Economic Output**: The aforementioned study indicates that extending relief measures to undocumented workers could have generated over $10 billion in economic activity, supporting around 82,000 jobs nationally and 17,000 in California alone. By not including these workers, the economy misses out on substantial contributions that could help stimulate recovery.\n\n2. **Increased Unemployment Rates**: The national unemployment rate for undocumented workers reached 29% in May 2020, significantly higher than that of other demographic groups. This high unemployment rate among a critical segment of the workforce can lead to decreased consumer spending, further exacerbating economic downturns.\n\n3. **Reduced Purchasing Power**: Undocumented workers and their families contributed more than $1.6 trillion to the nationâ€™s GDP in 2018 through their shopping and workforce activities. Their exclusion from relief measures diminishes their purchasing power, which can lead to a decrease in demand for goods and services, negatively impacting businesses and the overall economy.\n\n4. **Public Health and Economic Crisis**: The reduced economic stability of undocumented workers amid a looming recession poses both a public health and economic crisis. The lack of financial support can lead to increased stress and health issues, which can further strain public health systems and economic resources.\n\n5. **Long-term Economic Consequences**: The exclusion of undocumented workers from relief programs can create a cycle of economic instability. As these workers struggle to meet basic needs, their ability to contribute to the economy diminishes, leading to long-term negative effects on economic growth and recovery.\n\nIn summary, not including undocumented workers in relief programs poses significant economic risks, including lost output, increased unemployment, reduced purchasing power, and broader public health implications. Addressing these issues through inclusive economic policies could not only aid in recovery but also enhance overall economic stability.
