    What is the Reserve Bank of India's stance on core inflation?
answer: >-
    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has expressed concerns regarding core inflation, which is defined as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy items. Recent reports indicate that while overall inflation has shown signs of moderation, core inflation remains elevated. For instance, core inflation softened to a four-year low of 3.8% in December 2023, but it increased to an average of 3.4% during July-August 2024, influenced by rising core services inflation and mobile phone tariff revisions.\n\nThe RBI has a target inflation rate of 4% for sustainable economic growth, and it has adjusted its monetary policy stance in response to inflation trends. In its recent monetary policy meetings, the RBI has maintained an accommodative stance while monitoring core inflation closely. The central bank's decisions are influenced by the inflation outlook, global financial conditions, and liquidity situations.\n\nOverall, the RBI's stance on core inflation reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for economic growth with the imperative of price stability. The central bank continues to assess core inflation as a critical component in its monetary policy framework, recognizing its implications for broader economic conditions.
