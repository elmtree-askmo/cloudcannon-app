    Who are the recent Nobel Prize awardees in Economics and what are their contributions?
answer: >-
    The recent Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for 2023 was awarded to Claudia Goldin, an American economist and professor at Harvard University. She received the prize "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes." Goldin's research has significantly contributed to the understanding of the causes of wage and labor market inequality between men and women, highlighting key drivers of gender differences in the labor market.\n\nAt the age of 77, Goldin became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics since its inception in 1969 and the first woman to receive the award solo. Her work has been influential in shedding light on the evolving role of women in the workforce, particularly in high-income countries where women have increasingly pursued higher education and career opportunities.\n\nThe award is presented annually in Stockholm on December 10, commemorating the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. As of 2023, the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded 56 times to 96 individuals.
