    How have these diplomatic tensions affected bilateral trade and economic relations between India and Canada?
answer: >-
    The ongoing diplomatic tensions between India and Canada have had a notable impact on their bilateral trade and economic relations. While the overall trade figures indicate a significant volume of exchange, the political climate has raised concerns within the business community.\n\nIn 2023, total bilateral trade in goods between India and Canada was valued at approximately USD 9.36 billion, with India's exports to Canada amounting to USD 7.53 billion and imports from Canada at CAD 5.12 billion. Despite these figures, the tensions have led to a cautious approach among businesses, particularly in sectors such as IT, education, and tourism, which heavily depend on Indian workers, students, and tourists. Ritesh Malik, Chair of the Canada-India Business Council, noted that Canadian businesses are feeling the strain due to the diplomatic fallout.\n\nThe political implications of the tensions are significant, as they have led to the suspension of negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which was expected to enhance bilateral trade by an estimated USD 4.4-6.5 billion. The diplomatic rift, particularly following allegations regarding India's involvement in the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, has further complicated the relationship, leading to the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.\n\nWhile Canada comprises a small fraction of India's total trade—less than one percent—this relationship is crucial for certain sectors. The ongoing tensions have raised concerns about potential long-term effects on trade and investment connections, as both nations navigate the complexities of their diplomatic relations. The situation remains fluid, and the future of economic engagement between India and Canada will likely depend on the resolution of these diplomatic issues.
