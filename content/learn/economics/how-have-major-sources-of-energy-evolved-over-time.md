    How have major sources of energy evolved over time?
answer: >-
    The evolution of energy sources over time has been significantly influenced by economic and technological developments, leading to a gradual shift towards higher energy content sources. This evolution can be categorized into several key phases:\n\n1. **Prehistoric and Early Use of Biomass**: For thousands of years, early humans relied on traditional biomass, primarily wood, crop waste, and animal waste, as their main energy source. The controlled use of fire marked the first significant step in harnessing energy for heating and cooking.\n\n2. **Industrial Revolution**: The advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about a major transformation in energy use. The development of the steam engine, particularly through innovations by Thomas Newcomen and James Watt, allowed for the mechanization of industries and transportation, leading to increased demand for coal, which became the dominant energy source.\n\n3. **Transition to Fossil Fuels**: By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of coal began to decline as oil and natural gas emerged as more efficient and cleaner alternatives. The peak of petroleum consumption in the U.S. occurred in the 1970s, after which natural gas started to gain prominence. As of 2023, natural gas has become the leading energy source in the U.S., accounting for 38.2% of energy production, followed by crude oil at 26.1%.\n\n4. **Electricity Generation**: The 20th century saw a remarkable growth in electricity generation, which expanded from 66.4 TWh in 1900 to 29,165 TWh by 2022. Fossil fuels maintained a stable share of around 60% throughout this period, but the late 20th and early 21st centuries marked a significant rise in renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, driven by technological advancements and a growing emphasis on sustainability.\n\n5. **Current Trends and Future Projections**: Today, there is a strong push towards clean and renewable energy sources as societies seek to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels due to environmental concerns, including climate change and pollution. The transition to low-carbon energy sources, such as hydropower, wind, solar, and nuclear energy, is seen as essential for achieving energy security and sustainability in the future.\n\nOverall, the evolution of energy sources reflects a complex interplay of technological advancements, economic needs, and environmental considerations, with a clear trend towards cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions.
