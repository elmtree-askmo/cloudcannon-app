    What are the current seafood consumption patterns in Germany?
answer: >-
    As of 2023, seafood consumption patterns in Germany indicate a positive trend, with per capita consumption averaging 13.7 kilograms per person, which reflects a 1.5 percent increase compared to the previous year. This growth is notable given that Germans have shown a consistent appreciation for seafood, even amidst rising prices. In total, Germans spent over â‚¬5.0 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) on seafood, marking a 3.7 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nSalmon has emerged as the most popular seafood choice among Germans, with a per capita consumption of 2.4 kilograms in 2023, reclaiming its top position from Alaska pollock. Overall, the total consumption of salmon reached 198,128 tonnes. \n\nLooking ahead, the seafood market in Germany is projected to grow by 2.94% from 2024 to 2029, with an expected market volume of approximately $9.49 billion by 2029. This growth is anticipated to be driven by a rising emphasis on sustainable and ethical seafood sourcing, as consumers become more aware of the environmental and social impacts associated with fishing and aquaculture.\n\nIn summary, the current seafood consumption patterns in Germany reflect an increasing trend, with a strong market outlook driven by consumer preferences for sustainability and popular seafood choices like salmon.
