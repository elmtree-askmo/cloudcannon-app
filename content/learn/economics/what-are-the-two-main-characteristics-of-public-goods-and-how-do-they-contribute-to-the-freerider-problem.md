    What are the two main characteristics of public goods, and how do they contribute to the free-rider problem?
answer: >-
    Public goods are characterized by two main features: **non-excludability** and **non-rivalry**.\n\n1. **Non-excludability**: This means that it is not possible to prevent individuals from using the good, regardless of whether they have paid for it. For example, once a public good like national defense is provided, everyone benefits from it, and it is impossible to exclude anyone from its protection.\n\n2. **Non-rivalry**: This characteristic indicates that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce its availability to others. For instance, when one person enjoys a public park, it does not diminish the ability of others to enjoy the same park simultaneously.\n\nThese characteristics contribute to the **free-rider problem**. Since individuals cannot be excluded from using public goods, they may choose not to pay for them, knowing they can still benefit from them without contributing. This behavior leads to underfunding and underproduction of public goods, as private entities are often unwilling to provide these goods due to the inability to charge consumers effectively. Consequently, the free-rider problem results in market failure, where the socially optimal level of provision for public goods is not achieved, necessitating government intervention to ensure these goods are available to all.
