    What are the main types of direct and indirect taxes in the Philippines?
answer: >-
    In the Philippines, the taxation system is primarily divided into two main types: direct taxes and indirect taxes.\n\n### Direct Taxes\nDirect taxes are levied directly on individuals and corporations based on their income or wealth. The main types of direct taxes in the Philippines include:\n\n1. **Personal Income Tax**: This tax is imposed on the income earned by individuals. The rates are progressive, meaning they increase with higher income levels, with rates reaching up to 35% for the highest income brackets.\n\n2. **Corporate Income Tax**: Corporations are subject to income tax on their profits, with rates varying between 20% to 25% depending on the company's net taxable income.\n\n3. **Estate Tax**: This tax is levied on the transfer of the estate of a deceased person. The rates can vary based on the value of the estate.\n\n4. **Donorâ€™s Tax**: This tax applies to gifts made during a person's lifetime, with certain exemptions available for specific types of gifts.\n\n### Indirect Taxes\nIndirect taxes are imposed on goods and services and are typically collected at the point of sale. The main types of indirect taxes in the Philippines include:\n\n1. **Value-Added Tax (VAT)**: A consumption tax levied at a standard rate of 12% on most goods and services, including imports. Businesses are responsible for collecting VAT on their sales and remitting it to the government.\n\n2. **Excise Taxes**: These are taxes imposed on specific goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, and petroleum products. The rates vary depending on the type of product.\n\n3. **Customs Duties**: Taxes imposed on goods imported into the country, which vary based on the type of goods and their value.\n\nOverall, both direct and indirect taxes play a crucial role in the Philippines' fiscal system, contributing to government revenue and funding public services and infrastructure development.
