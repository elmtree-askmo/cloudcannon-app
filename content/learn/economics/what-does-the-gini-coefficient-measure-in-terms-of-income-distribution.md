    What does the Gini Coefficient measure in terms of income distribution?
answer: >-
    The Gini Coefficient, also known as the Gini Index or Gini Ratio, is a statistical measure that quantifies income or wealth distribution within a population. It is primarily used to assess economic inequality. The Gini Coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n\n- A Gini Coefficient of 0 indicates perfect equality, meaning that everyone in the population has the same income or wealth.\n- A Gini Coefficient of 1 signifies perfect inequality, where one individual has all the income or wealth, and everyone else has none.\n\nThe Gini Coefficient is derived from the Lorenz Curve, which illustrates the cumulative distribution of income or wealth across the population. The calculation involves determining the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz Curve, expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nG = \frac{A}{A + B}\n$$\n\nwhere $ A $ is the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz Curve, and $ B $ is the area under the Lorenz Curve.\n\nThis measure is particularly useful because it summarizes the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution into a single statistic. It allows for comparisons of income inequality across different countries and over time. However, it is important to note that the Gini Coefficient is a relative measure; it can increase in a developing country even if the absolute number of people living in poverty decreases, as it reflects the relative distribution of income rather than absolute wealth levels.\n\nIn summary, the Gini Coefficient serves as a critical indicator of income inequality, providing insights into how income is distributed among the population of a nation or social group.
