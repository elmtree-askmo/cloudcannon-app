    How has de-industrialization affected economic indicators in India?
answer: >-
    De-industrialization in India, particularly during the colonial period from 1757 to 1947, had profound effects on various economic indicators. The term refers to a significant reduction in industrial activities, which can be traced back to the policies of the British East India Company and the subsequent British colonial rule. \n\n1. **Historical Context**: At the beginning of the 18th century, India was a major player in global manufacturing, contributing approximately 25% of the world's industrial output. However, by 1900, this figure had plummeted to around 2%. This drastic decline was largely attributed to British protectionist policies that favored British goods over Indian products, severely restricting the growth of local industries.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators**: The impact of de-industrialization can be observed through several economic indicators:\n   - **Manufacturing Output**: India's share in total world manufacturing output decreased significantly, from 24.5% in 1750 to 19.7% in 1800, and further down to a mere fraction by the end of the colonial period.\n   - **GDP Growth**: The period of de-industrialization coincided with stagnation in GDP growth. For instance, during the post-independence period from 1950-51 to 1979-80, the growth rate of GDP was only 3.5% per annum, which was relatively low compared to the potential growth that could have been achieved with a robust industrial base.\n   - **Employment**: The decline in industrial activities also led to reduced employment opportunities in manufacturing sectors, pushing a significant portion of the workforce back into agriculture or informal sectors, which typically offer lower wages and less job security.\n\n3. **Long-term Implications**: The long-term implications of de-industrialization have sparked extensive debates among economists. The narrative suggests that the colonial policies not only stunted industrial growth but also created a legacy of economic imbalance that India continues to grapple with. The shift from a predominantly agrarian economy to a service-oriented economy, bypassing a strong industrial phase, has led to structural challenges in economic development.\n\nIn summary, de-industrialization has had a lasting impact on India's economic indicators, contributing to a legacy of low industrial output, slow GDP growth, and employment challenges that have shaped the country's economic landscape even post-independence.
