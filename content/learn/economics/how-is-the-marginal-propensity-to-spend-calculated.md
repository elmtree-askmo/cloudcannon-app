    How is the marginal propensity to spend calculated?
answer: >-
    The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a key concept in Keynesian economics that measures the proportion of additional income that a consumer spends on consumption rather than saving. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nMPC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}\n$$\n\nwhere $\Delta C$ represents the change in consumption and $\Delta Y$ represents the change in income. \n\nTo illustrate, if an individual's income increases by $5,000 and their consumption rises by $4,500, the calculation for the MPC would be:\n\n$$\nMPC = \frac{4,500}{5,000} = 0.9\n$$\n\nThis means that the individual spends 90% of any additional income on consumption. Conversely, if the MPC is lower, it indicates that the individual is saving a larger portion of their income increase.\n\nThe MPC is significant because it helps economists understand consumer behavior and the overall impact of fiscal policy on the economy. A higher MPC suggests that consumers are likely to spend more of their income, which can stimulate economic growth, while a lower MPC indicates a tendency to save more, potentially leading to slower economic growth.
