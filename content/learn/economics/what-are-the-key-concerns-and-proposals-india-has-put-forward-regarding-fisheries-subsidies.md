    What are the key concerns and proposals India has put forward regarding fisheries subsidies?
answer: >-
    India has raised several key concerns and proposals regarding fisheries subsidies at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Opposition to Subsidy Curbs**: India has firmly opposed any restrictions on subsidies provided to poor fishermen, emphasizing the importance of these subsidies for the livelihoods of small-scale and artisanal fishers. The country argues that these subsidies are essential for the growth and sustainability of the fishing sector.\n\n2. **Moratorium on Distant Water Fishing Subsidies**: India has called for a moratorium on subsidies provided by Distant Water Fishing Nations for activities beyond their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) for a period of at least 25 years. This proposal aims to protect local fisheries from the impacts of large-scale industrial fishing fleets.\n\n3. **Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)**: India advocates for the principle of CBDR, which recognizes that different countries have varying capabilities and responsibilities. It proposes a 25-year transition period for developing countries to adapt to new regulations, ensuring that their livelihood and food security concerns are addressed.\n\n4. **Focus on Small-Scale Fishers**: The negotiations should prioritize the protection of small-scale, artisanal, and indigenous fishers, as they are directly impacted by the outcomes of the WTO discussions. India emphasizes that responsible and sustainable fishing practices are integral to the ethos of its diverse fishing communities.\n\n5. **Regulatory Framework**: India supports the establishment of regulations under the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement (FSA) that effectively check large-scale industrial fishing while not inhibiting the growth of small-scale fisheries. This approach aims to balance sustainability with the economic needs of local fishers.\n\n6. **Support from Developing Nations**: India's proposals have garnered substantial backing from numerous developing nations and least developed countries (LDCs), indicating a collective interest in ensuring that fisheries subsidies regulations are fair and equitable.\n\nThese concerns and proposals reflect India's commitment to protecting its fishing communities while advocating for sustainable practices in the global fisheries sector.
