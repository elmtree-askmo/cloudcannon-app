    What is the current level of U.S. military expenditure and how does it compare globally?
answer: >-
    As of 2023, the United States military expenditure is approximately $820.3 billion, which constitutes about 13.3% of the entire federal budget for that fiscal year. The Department of Defense (DoD) has requested an increase to $842.0 billion for the fiscal year 2024, reflecting a 2.6% rise in spending. This positions the U.S. as the largest military spender globally, accounting for nearly 40% of total military expenditures by countries around the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nIn comparison to other nations, U.S. military spending is significantly higher. For instance, in 2023, the total global military expenditure reached $2,443 billion, marking a 6.8% increase from the previous year. The U.S. alone represents a substantial portion of this total, with its defense budget being more than that of any other country. Notably, China, the second-largest military spender, is estimated to have a military budget of around $407.9 billion, which is roughly half of the U.S. expenditure.\n\nThis disparity highlights the U.S.'s dominant position in global military spending, with all other nations, except for China, spending less than a tenth of what the U.S. allocates for its military. The U.S. military budget not only supports a large active-duty force of nearly 1.3 million troops but also encompasses various categories of spending, including operation and maintenance, personnel compensation, and modernization efforts.
