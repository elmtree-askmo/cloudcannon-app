    What economic impact has the floriculture initiative had on farmers in Odisha?
answer: >-
    The floriculture initiative in Odisha has had a significant economic impact on farmers in the region. This initiative represents a pioneering effort by a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) in Odisha to integrate institutional applied research into its operational model. The goal is to adapt to climate change while enhancing flower production and marketing, which ultimately empowers farmers economically.\n\nOdisha has approximately 6,500 hectares dedicated to floriculture, producing around 24,800 metric tons of flowers. The demand for various flowers, such as roses, marigolds, and lotuses, is increasing both domestically and internationally. This growing market presents substantial opportunities for farmers, who are transitioning from traditional paddy farming to flower cultivation. \n\nThe economic benefits of this initiative are notable; flower cultivation can yield returns that are five times greater than traditional crops. The local market currently meets only 20% to 30% of the daily demand for flowers, indicating a significant opportunity for farmers to capitalize on this gap. Additionally, the initiative has attracted small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, further stimulating economic activity in the region.\n\nOverall, the floriculture initiative not only enhances the livelihoods of farmers in Odisha but also contributes to the broader economic landscape by fostering entrepreneurial opportunities and addressing the increasing demand for flowers.
