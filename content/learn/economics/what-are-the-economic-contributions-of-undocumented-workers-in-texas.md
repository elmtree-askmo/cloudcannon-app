    What are the economic contributions of undocumented workers in Texas?
answer: >-
    Undocumented workers in Texas make significant economic contributions that are often highlighted in various studies and assessments. Here are some key points regarding their economic impact:\n\n1. **Spending Power**: Undocumented immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, hold substantial spending power. In Texas, more than 1 million Mexican undocumented immigrants have an estimated spending power of over $82.2 billion. This spending supports local economies through purchases of housing, consumer goods, and services.\n\n2. **Labor Force Participation**: Immigrants, including undocumented workers, constitute a vital part of Texas's labor force, making up nearly 23% of the workforce. This translates to approximately 3.3 million workers, with undocumented immigrants representing about 8% of the total workforce. Their contributions are particularly pronounced in sectors such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing, where they help fill critical labor shortages.\n\n3. **Fiscal Contributions**: According to a cost-benefit analysis conducted by the Baker Institute, for every dollar spent by the Texas state government on public services for undocumented immigrants, the state collects approximately $1.21 in revenue. This indicates that the economic benefits of undocumented workers outweigh the costs associated with the public services they utilize.\n\n4. **Tax Contributions**: In 2022, undocumented Texans contributed around $4.9 billion in state and local taxes. The majority of this revenue came from sales and excise taxes (58%), followed by property taxes (37%). If undocumented immigrants were granted work authorization, their tax contributions could increase by an additional $474 million annually.\n\n5. **Economic Output**: The overall contribution of immigrants to the Texas economy is estimated at $119 billion in personal income annually. This figure underscores the significant role that both documented and undocumented immigrants play in driving economic growth in the state.\n\nIn summary, undocumented workers in Texas are integral to the state's economy, contributing significantly through their labor, spending, and tax payments. Their presence not only supports various industries but also generates fiscal revenue that benefits the state.
