    How do poverty levels vary between different countries?
answer: >-
    Poverty levels vary significantly between different countries, influenced by various economic, social, and political factors. The measurement of poverty can be approached in two primary ways: the percentage of people living below a national poverty line and the international poverty line set by organizations like the World Bank.\n\nFor instance, in the United States, the poverty rate is approximately 17.8%, while the United Kingdom and Canada have rates of 18.6% and 11.6%, respectively. In contrast, countries like China and Ukraine report much lower poverty rates, at 0.6% and 1.1%, respectively. These figures highlight the diverse strategies and policies implemented in different nations to combat poverty.\n\nGlobally, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $2.15 a day (in 2017 international dollars). This benchmark is used to assess poverty levels across various countries. The global poverty rate was estimated at 44.90% in 2022, reflecting a slight decline from previous years. However, the situation remains dire in many regions, particularly in the world's poorest countries, where economic growth is weak, and extreme poverty persists.\n\nAdditionally, the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality within a country, can provide further context to poverty levels. For example, South Africa has the highest Gini coefficient at 63.0%, indicating significant income disparity, while countries like Slovenia and the Czech Republic have much lower coefficients, suggesting more equitable income distribution.\n\nOverall, the variation in poverty levels across countries is a complex issue, influenced by local economic conditions, government policies, and international aid efforts. Organizations such as the United Nations and World Vision are actively working to improve access to essential services for impoverished populations, aiming to break the cycle of poverty and promote sustainable development.
