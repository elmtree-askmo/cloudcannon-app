answer: >-
    An example of comparative advantage can be illustrated using the hypothetical production capabilities of New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK) in two goods: machinery and wool.\n\nAssume the following production possibilities for each country:\n\n- **New Zealand** can produce:\n  - 30,000 metric tonnes of wool per year\n  - 6,000 units of machinery per year\n\n- **United Kingdom (UK)** can produce:\n  - 20,000 metric tonnes of wool per year\n  - 10,000 units of machinery per year\n\nTo determine comparative advantage, we need to calculate the opportunity cost for each country when producing one good over the other.\n\n1. **New Zealand's Opportunity Cost**:\n   - To produce 1 unit of machinery, New Zealand gives up the opportunity to produce 5 metric tonnes of wool (30,000 wool / 6,000 machinery).\n   - Conversely, to produce 1 metric tonne of wool, New Zealand gives up the opportunity to produce 1/5 (or 0.2) units of machinery.\n\n2. **UK's Opportunity Cost**:\n   - To produce 1 unit of machinery, the UK gives up the opportunity to produce 2 metric tonnes of wool (20,000 wool / 10,000 machinery).\n   - Conversely, to produce 1 metric tonne of wool, the UK gives up the opportunity to produce 0.5 units of machinery.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that:\n\n- New Zealand has a lower opportunity cost for producing wool (0.2 machinery per wool) compared to the UK (0.5 machinery per wool). Therefore, New Zealand has a comparative advantage in wool production.\n- The UK has a lower opportunity cost for producing machinery (5 wool per machinery) compared to New Zealand (2 wool per machinery). Thus, the UK has a comparative advantage in machinery production.\n\nIn conclusion, New Zealand should specialize in wool production, while the UK should specialize in machinery production. By trading, both countries can benefit from their respective comparative advantages, leading to increased overall efficiency and gains from trade.
