    How are fertilizer and food subsidies being addressed in the latest budget?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, the government has made significant adjustments to fertilizer and food subsidies. The food subsidy budget is projected at ₹2,05,250 crore, which represents a 3.34% decrease from the revised estimates for the fiscal year 2024. Meanwhile, the fertilizer subsidy has been reduced by ₹1 lakh crore, or 13.18%, bringing it down to ₹1,64,000 crore compared to the actual expenditure in FY 2022-23.\n\nOverall, the budget reflects a 7.8% reduction in subsidies for food, fertilizer, and fuel, with a total allocation of ₹3,81,175 crore. This includes ₹2,05,250 crore for food subsidies, ₹1,64,000 crore for fertilizer subsidies, and ₹11,925 crore for petroleum subsidies, primarily for LPG. These changes aim to balance fiscal prudence with welfare measures, although they have raised concerns among farmers regarding the impact on agricultural productivity and food security.\n\nAdditionally, the budget emphasizes a higher allocation for agriculture, which is intended to improve productivity and revolutionize agricultural research, despite the cuts in subsidies. The government is also expanding the application of Nano DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate) in Indian agriculture, which may help mitigate some of the adverse effects of reduced fertilizer subsidies.\n\nIn summary, while the budget aims to maintain fiscal discipline, the reductions in fertilizer and food subsidies have sparked concerns about their potential impact on the agricultural sector and food security in the country.
