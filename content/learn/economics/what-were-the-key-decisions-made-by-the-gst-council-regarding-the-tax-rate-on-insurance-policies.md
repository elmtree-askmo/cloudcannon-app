    What were the key decisions made by the GST Council regarding the tax rate on insurance policies?
answer: >-
    The key decisions made by the GST Council regarding the tax rate on insurance policies, particularly life and health insurance, include the following:\n\n1. **Reduction of GST Rate**: The GST Council has reached a broad consensus on reducing the GST rate on life and health insurance premiums from the current rate of 18%. However, a final decision on this reduction is expected to be made in the next council meeting.\n\n2. **Formation of a Group of Ministers (GoM)**: During the 54th GST Council meeting, a GoM was established to evaluate the current GST rates for life and health insurance. This group is tasked with reviewing the tax structure and is expected to submit a report by the end of October 2024.\n\n3. **Postponement of Final Decision**: The decision on the reduction of the GST rate on health insurance premiums has been postponed to November, pending the GoM's report.\n\n4. **Previous Meeting Outcomes**: In the 53rd GST Council meeting, significant relief was provided to the reinsurance and general insurance industry, including the classification of co-insurance premiums as "no supply" under GST law, meaning no tax will be levied on these premiums.\n\n5. **Specific Tax Rate for Cancer Drugs**: Additionally, the GST Council decided to reduce the tax rate on cancer drugs to 5%, which reflects a broader effort to make healthcare more affordable.\n\nThese decisions indicate the GST Council's ongoing efforts to address concerns regarding high tax rates on health and life insurance, with the aim of providing relief to policyholders and the insurance industry.
