    What are the different types of price elasticity of demand?
answer: >-
    Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to changes in its price. There are several types of price elasticity of demand, which can be categorized based on the degree of responsiveness. Here are the main types:\n\n1. **Perfectly Elastic Demand** ($E_P = \infty$): Demand is perfectly elastic when any small change in price leads to an infinite change in quantity demanded. In this case, consumers will only buy at a specific price, and any increase in price will cause the quantity demanded to drop to zero.\n\n2. **Perfectly Inelastic Demand** ($E_P = 0$): Demand is perfectly inelastic when the quantity demanded does not change regardless of price changes. This means that consumers will purchase the same amount of the good no matter how much the price increases or decreases. Essential goods, such as life-saving medications, often exhibit this type of demand.\n\n3. **Relatively Elastic Demand**: This occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price (i.e., $E_P > 1$). In this case, consumers are quite responsive to price changes, and a small decrease in price leads to a significant increase in quantity demanded.\n\n4. **Relatively Inelastic Demand**: This type of demand is characterized by a percentage change in quantity demanded that is less than the percentage change in price (i.e., $E_P < 1$). Here, consumers are less responsive to price changes, meaning that even a significant increase in price will result in only a small decrease in quantity demanded.\n\n5. **Unitary Elastic Demand**: Demand is unitary elastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price (i.e., $E_P = 1$). In this scenario, total revenue remains constant when the price changes, as the increase in price is exactly offset by the decrease in quantity demanded.\n\nUnderstanding these types of price elasticity helps businesses and economists predict consumer behavior and make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies and revenue optimization.
