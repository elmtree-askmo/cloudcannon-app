    How is India addressing energy and infrastructure needs?
answer: >-
    India is actively addressing its energy and infrastructure needs through a combination of government policies, significant investments, and ambitious targets aimed at enhancing economic growth and sustainability.\n\n### Energy Initiatives\n\n1. **Investment in Clean Energy**: India has seen a surge in clean energy investments, reaching approximately USD 68 billion in 2023, which is a nearly 40% increase from the 2016-2020 average. A substantial portion of this investment is directed towards low-emissions power generation, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. In contrast, fossil fuel investments grew by 6% to USD 33 billion during the same period.\n\n2. **Government Support and Subsidies**: To mitigate the impact of rising fossil fuel prices, the Indian government has implemented measures such as capping retail prices of petrol, diesel, and domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In FY 2023, total energy subsidies surged to INR 3.2 lakh crore (USD 39.3 billion), with renewable energy subsidies increasing to INR 14,843 crore (USD 1.8 billion), marking an 8% rise from the previous fiscal year.\n\n3. **Advanced Energy Solutions**: India is setting ambitious targets for deploying advanced energy solutions, including clean hydrogen, energy storage, and carbon capture technologies. By 2030, the country plans to invest over USD 35 billion annually in these areas, positioning itself as a leader in the global renewable energy supply chain.\n\n### Infrastructure Development\n\n1. **National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)**: Launched in December 2019, the NIP outlines a comprehensive framework for infrastructure development, emphasizing social and economic projects worth INR 102 lakh crores. The funding is expected to come from a mix of government (39% from the Centre and 40% from States) and private sector contributions (21%).\n\n2. **Focus on Urban Infrastructure**: More than half of India's urban infrastructure needs, including housing, electricity, transportation, water, and waste management, remain unmet. To address this, India must invest approximately USD 4.5 trillion in infrastructure by 2030 to support economic growth and societal well-being.\n\n3. **Budget Allocations**: In the Union Budget for 2022-23, the Indian government allocated INR 7,327 crores for the solar power sector and introduced sovereign green bonds to support renewable energy projects. The government is also focusing on enhancing transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, and aviation, to meet the demands of a growing population and economy.\n\n4. **Rural Connectivity Initiatives**: The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Phase IV aims to provide connectivity to 25,000 rural habitations, highlighting the government's commitment to improving infrastructure at the grassroots level.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIndia's approach to addressing its energy and infrastructure needs is multifaceted, involving substantial investments in renewable energy, strategic government policies, and a focus on both urban and rural infrastructure development. These initiatives are crucial for achieving the country's economic growth targets, including the goal of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, while also ensuring sustainability and energy security.
