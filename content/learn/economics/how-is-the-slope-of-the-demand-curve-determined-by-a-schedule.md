    How is the slope of the demand curve determined by a schedule?
answer: >-
    The slope of the demand curve is determined by the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, which can be illustrated through a demand schedule. A demand schedule is a tabular representation that shows how much of a product consumers are willing to purchase at various price levels. \n\nTo visualize this relationship, the demand schedule can be plotted on a graph, with price on the vertical axis (y-axis) and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis (x-axis). Each point on the graph corresponds to a price-quantity pair from the demand schedule. The demand curve typically slopes downward from left to right, indicating that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. This negative slope reflects the law of demand, which states that, all else being equal, higher prices lead to lower quantities demanded.\n\nMathematically, the slope of the demand curve can be calculated using the formula for slope, which is defined as the change in the vertical variable (price) divided by the change in the horizontal variable (quantity). This can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}\n$$\n\nWhere $\Delta P$ is the change in price and $\Delta Q$ is the change in quantity demanded. \n\nIf the demand curve is a straight line, its slope remains constant across all price levels. However, if the demand curve is not linear (for example, a rectangular hyperbola), the slope will vary, and the elasticity of demand will change as well. In such cases, while the slope may decrease, the elasticity can remain constant at 1, indicating unitary elasticity.\n\nIn summary, the slope of the demand curve is derived from the demand schedule by plotting the price and quantity pairs on a graph and calculating the slope based on the changes in these variables. This graphical representation helps to illustrate the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, which is fundamental to the concept of demand in economics.
