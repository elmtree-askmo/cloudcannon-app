    What are the characteristics of public goods?
answer: >-
    Public goods are characterized by two main properties: non-excludability and non-rivalry. Here are the key characteristics of public goods:\n\n1. **Non-Excludability**: This means that it is not possible to prevent individuals from accessing the good once it has been provided. For example, national defense protects all citizens regardless of whether they have paid for it or not. This characteristic often leads to the "free rider problem," where individuals may benefit from the good without contributing to its cost.\n\n2. **Non-Rivalry**: The consumption of a public good by one individual does not reduce the availability of the good for consumption by others. For instance, one person's enjoyment of a public park does not diminish the ability of others to enjoy the same park.\n\n3. **Collective Consumption**: Public goods are typically consumed collectively, meaning that they are available for use by all members of society. This collective nature is what distinguishes public goods from private goods, which are consumed individually and can be depleted.\n\n4. **Underprovision in Free Markets**: Because of their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature, public goods are often underprovided in a free market. Private firms may not find it profitable to produce these goods, leading to a reliance on government provision or funding through taxation.\n\n5. **Examples**: Common examples of public goods include national defense, public parks, street lighting, and clean air. These goods are essential for societal welfare but may not be adequately supplied by the market.\n\nIn summary, public goods are essential for the functioning of society, and their unique characteristics necessitate government intervention to ensure they are provided adequately.
