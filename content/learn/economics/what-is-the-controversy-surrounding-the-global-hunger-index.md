    What is the controversy surrounding the Global Hunger Index?
answer: >-
    The controversy surrounding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) primarily stems from India's ranking and the methodology used to assess hunger levels. In the 2023 GHI report, India was ranked 111 out of 125 countries, which sparked significant debate and criticism from the Indian government. The government accused the GHI of having "mala fide intent" and raised concerns about the methodology, particularly regarding the use of the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) and the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) surveys. \n\nCritics argue that the GHI is a comprehensive tool that reflects multiple dimensions of hunger, utilizing data from UN and other multilateral agencies. However, the Indian government contends that the GHI does not accurately represent the country's hunger situation and that it is designed to report hunger levels rather than conduct an audit of food security.\n\nThe 2023 report indicated that India's GHI score of 28.7 categorizes the level of hunger as "serious," and it highlighted that India ranked lower than several neighboring countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. This ranking has raised alarms about the state of food security and nutrition in India, especially in light of the country's economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, the GHI has faced scrutiny for its perceived lack of attention to other surveys, such as those conducted by UNICEF, which may provide different insights into hunger and malnutrition. The ongoing debate reflects broader concerns about food insecurity and the effectiveness of government initiatives aimed at addressing these issues.\n\nIn summary, the controversy surrounding the Global Hunger Index involves disputes over its methodology, the implications of India's ranking, and the broader context of food security challenges in the country.
