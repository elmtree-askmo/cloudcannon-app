    What strategies are used to manage economic exposure?
answer: >-
    To manage economic exposure, companies can employ two primary strategies: operational strategies and currency risk-mitigation strategies.\n\n1. **Operational Strategies**: These strategies focus on adjusting the company's operations to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations. Key operational strategies include:\n   - **Diversifying Production Facilities**: By spreading production across different geographical locations, companies can reduce their reliance on any single currency and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations.\n   - **Market Diversification**: Expanding into multiple markets can help balance the effects of currency changes, as losses in one market may be offset by gains in another.\n   - **Flexible Sourcing Policies**: Companies can maintain flexibility in sourcing materials and components from different countries, allowing them to take advantage of favorable exchange rates.\n\n2. **Currency Risk-Mitigation Strategies**: These strategies involve using financial instruments to hedge against currency risks. Common techniques include:\n   - **Currency Hedging**: This involves using financial instruments such as forward contracts, options, or currency swaps to lock in exchange rates for future transactions. By doing so, companies can provide certainty regarding their cash flows and reduce exposure to adverse currency movements.\n   - **Matching Currency Flows**: Aligning revenues and expenses in the same currency can help mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations affecting cash flows.\n\nThe main objective of managing economic exposure is to stabilize cash flows in the face of fluctuating exchange rates, thereby protecting the company's financial performance and market value. Given the complexities of economic exposure, which is often long-term and difficult to quantify, a combination of these strategies is typically employed to effectively manage the associated risks.
