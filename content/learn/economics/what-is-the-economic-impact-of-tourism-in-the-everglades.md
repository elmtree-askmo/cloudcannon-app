    What is the economic impact of tourism in the Everglades?
answer: >-
    The economic impact of tourism in the Everglades is significant, contributing to both local and state economies. According to a National Park Service (NPS) report, in 2014, approximately 1,110,900 visitors to Everglades National Park spent around $104.5 million in nearby communities. This spending supported approximately 1,552 jobs and generated a cumulative economic benefit of about $155.5 million for the local economy.\n\nIn previous years, tourism figures have shown similar trends. For instance, in 2011, tourism related to Everglades National Park generated an economic benefit of $146.8 million, providing 2,408 jobs. In 2010, 915,538 visitors spent about $135.5 million, supporting 1,956 jobs in the area. These figures highlight the importance of the Everglades as a destination for ecotourism, which is a major component of Florida's broader tourism industry.\n\nThe overall economic impact of tourism in Florida is substantial, with the tourism sector contributing approximately $85.9 billion to the state's economy and supporting 1.5 million jobs statewide. The health of the Everglades ecosystem is crucial for sustaining this economic activity, as clean water and a healthy environment are foundational to outdoor recreation, tourism, and related sectors.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while tourism brings economic benefits, it can also pose challenges to the environment. Sustainable tourism practices are essential to ensure that the ecological integrity of the Everglades is maintained, allowing for continued economic benefits without compromising the health of this unique ecosystem.
