    What assumptions are made in the key forecast assumptions regarding domestic factors?
answer: >-
    In the context of inflation forecasts and economic growth, key forecast assumptions regarding domestic factors typically include several critical elements:\n\n1. **Real GDP Growth**: The Administration forecasts an average real GDP growth rate of 2.0 percent (fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter) from 2024 to 2034. This projection is slightly higher than other estimates, such as the 1.8 percent average from Blue Chip and the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant, and the 1.9 percent average from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for the same period.\n\n2. **Inflation Rate Projections**: The long-term Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) inflation rate is projected at 2.3 percent, which aligns with the CBO's long-term projection and is consistent with the FOMC's target for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation of 2.0 percent.\n\n3. **Impact of Federal Spending**: The projections incorporate assumptions about federal spending, particularly that caps on discretionary funding set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act will limit the growth of discretionary outlays and public debt. This slower growth in federal spending is expected to dampen overall economic growth, leading to decreased consumer spending, increased unemployment, lower inflation, and reduced interest rates.\n\n4. **Labor Market Dynamics**: The forecasts consider the strength of the labor market, which has shown stronger performance than previously projected. However, rising delinquency rates on credit cards and consumer loans indicate that some consumers may have exhausted their savings, potentially affecting future spending.\n\n5. **Investment Trends**: Real business fixed investment is projected to increase by only 1.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting cautious business sentiment amid economic uncertainties.\n\n6. **Potential Output Growth**: The economy's potential output is expected to grow more slowly over the 2028â€“2033 period compared to historical trends, primarily due to a long-term slowdown in labor force growth and productivity.\n\nThese assumptions are crucial for understanding the broader economic outlook and the potential risks associated with inflation and growth forecasts. They highlight the interconnectedness of federal policy, consumer behavior, and macroeconomic indicators in shaping the economic landscape.
