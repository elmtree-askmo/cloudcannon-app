answer: >-
    In August 2023, India's core sector output experienced significant growth, increasing by 12.1% on an annual basis. This marked a notable improvement compared to the previous month, July 2023, when the growth rate was recorded at 8.4%. The positive performance was driven by all eight core industries, which include Cement, Coal, Crude Oil, Electricity, Fertilizers, Natural Gas, Refinery Products, and Steel, all of which recorded positive growth during this period.\n\nAmong the sectors, the Cement industry showed the highest growth at 18.9%, followed closely by Coal at 17.9% and Steel at 10.9%. Additionally, when compared to pre-pandemic levels (February 2020), the core sector growth was 17.0% higher, indicating a strong recovery trajectory. The month-on-month seasonally adjusted core sector growth also demonstrated robust momentum, with a sequential expansion of 2.7% in August 2023, the sharpest since December 2022.\n\nOverall, the performance of India's core sector in August 2023 was a positive indicator of economic recovery and growth, reflecting strong production levels across key infrastructure sectors.
