    How does a price decrease affect total revenue when demand is elastic?
answer: >-
    When demand is elastic (where the price elasticity of demand, PED, is greater than 1), a decrease in price leads to a proportionally larger increase in the quantity demanded. This relationship has significant implications for total revenue (TR), which is calculated as:\n\n$$\nTR = \text{Price} \times \text{Quantity Sold}\n$$\n\nIn the case of elastic demand, the following occurs:\n\n1. **Price Decrease**: When a firm lowers its price, the price reduction results in a higher quantity demanded. Since the demand is elastic, the percentage increase in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage decrease in price.\n\n2. **Total Revenue Increase**: Because the increase in quantity sold outweighs the decrease in price, total revenue increases. This can be summarized as:\n   - If PED > 1 (elastic demand), then a decrease in price results in an increase in total revenue.\n\nFor example, if a company sells a product for $10 and lowers the price to $8, and as a result, the quantity sold increases from 100 units to 150 units, the total revenue before and after the price change can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Before price decrease:\n  $$ \n  TR = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \n  $$\n\n- After price decrease:\n  $$ \n  TR = 8 \times 150 = 1200 \n  $$\n\nIn this scenario, total revenue increased from $1000 to $1200 due to the price decrease, demonstrating the positive relationship between price decreases and total revenue when demand is elastic.\n\nIn summary, when demand is elastic, a price decrease will lead to an increase in total revenue, as the increase in quantity sold compensates for the lower price.
