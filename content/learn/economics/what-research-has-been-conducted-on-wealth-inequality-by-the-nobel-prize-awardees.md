    What research has been conducted on wealth inequality by the Nobel Prize awardees?
answer: >-
    The 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for their significant research into wealth inequality between nations. Their work focuses on understanding the persistent global inequality, particularly in countries affected by corruption and dictatorship. \n\nThe laureates have explored how the formation and nature of societal institutions play a crucial role in determining economic prosperity. Their research highlights that the disparities in wealth among nations are not merely a result of economic factors but are deeply intertwined with the political and institutional frameworks that govern these countries. \n\nAcemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's contributions have had a profound impact on the fields of economics and political science, providing insights into why some nations thrive economically while others struggle. Their findings emphasize the importance of effective institutions in fostering economic growth and reducing inequality, thereby influencing policy discussions and academic research on global wealth disparities. \n\nThis recognition underscores the relevance of their work in addressing critical issues related to economic inequality and the role of governance in shaping economic outcomes.
