    How does utility influence property value?
answer: >-
    Utility plays a crucial role in determining property value, as it refers to the usefulness and functionality of a property. For a property to hold value, it must meet the needs and desires of potential buyers or users. Here are several key points on how utility influences property value:\n\n1. **Functional Utility**: Appraisers consider the functional utility of a property when determining its market value. A property that effectively serves its intended purpose—whether residential, commercial, or industrial—will generally be valued higher than one that does not.\n\n2. **Easements and Restrictions**: Utility easements, which allow utility companies access to install and maintain essential services like power lines and water pipes, can impact how a property is used. While many residential properties have utility easements, they typically do not adversely affect property value unless they impose significant restrictions on the owner's ability to use or develop the land. Strict easements can make a property less desirable, potentially leading to a decrease in value.\n\n3. **Impact of Utility Installations**: Upgrades to utilities can enhance property value by improving functionality and lowering operating costs. For instance, modernizing electrical systems or plumbing can make a property more appealing to buyers.\n\n4. **Negative Impacts of Proximity to Utilities**: Studies have shown that properties located near high-voltage power lines or utility-scale solar installations may experience a decrease in value. For example, a study indicated that vacant lots near high-voltage power lines sold for approximately 44.9% less than comparable lots not near such lines. This suggests that while utility is essential, the type and proximity of utility installations can negatively influence property value.\n\n5. **The Four Essentials of Value**: Utility is one of the four foundational pillars of property valuation, alongside demand, scarcity, and transferability. A property must not only be useful but also scarce and in demand to achieve a higher market value.\n\nIn summary, utility significantly influences property value by determining how well a property meets the needs of its users, the presence of easements, the impact of utility installations, and its alignment with the essential elements of value. Understanding these factors is crucial for property owners, buyers, and investors alike.
