    What recent monetary policy decisions have been made to address inflation?
answer: >-
    Recent monetary policy decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to address inflation have included a series of interest rate increases and a reduction in the central bank's securities holdings. As of March 2023, inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), had decreased from a peak of 7.0% in June 2022 to 5.4% in January 2023. However, this rate remained significantly above the FOMC's long-term objective of 2%.\n\nIn response to the persistent inflation, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate multiple times, totaling over 500 basis points since early 2022. Despite this aggressive tightening, the Committee slowed the pace of rate increases during its December 2022 and January 2023 meetings, indicating that ongoing increases would still be necessary to achieve a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance aimed at returning inflation to the 2% target over time.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve has been actively reducing its holdings of Treasury and agency securities, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT). This began in June 2022, with principal payments from these securities being reinvested only to the extent that they exceeded monthly caps. The FOMC's decisions reflect a careful assessment of the balance of risks, including potential impacts on the financial system.\n\nOverall, the FOMC's recent monetary policy actions have been characterized by a combination of interest rate hikes and a strategic reduction of the balance sheet, aimed at curbing inflation while considering the lagged effects of these policies on economic activity.
