    What exemptions have been proposed for universities and airlines under the GST framework?
answer: >-
    Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework, several exemptions have been proposed for universities and airlines, particularly highlighted during the 54th GST Council meeting held on September 9, 2024. Here are the key exemptions:\n\n1. **Exemptions for Universities**:\n   - Academic institutions, particularly those that receive research grants, are exempt from GST. This exemption is aimed at promoting research and development activities across various sectors.\n   - Specifically, state-provided funding to universities and research centers for research purposes is exempt from GST. This move is expected to encourage more research initiatives within these institutions.\n   - However, it is important to note that while universities are exempt from GST on certain research grants, services related to affiliation to colleges and educational boards are still subject to an 18% GST, although there is a recent exemption for government schools.\n\n2. **Exemptions for Airlines**:\n   - Foreign airlines operating in India are exempt from GST on services provided by their head offices to branch offices in India. This exemption is intended to ease the tax burden on foreign airlines and facilitate smoother operations.\n   - Additionally, flight training courses that are approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) are also exempt from GST, which supports the aviation training sector.\n\nThese exemptions reflect the government's efforts to reduce the tax burden on educational institutions and foreign airlines, thereby promoting growth and compliance within these sectors.
