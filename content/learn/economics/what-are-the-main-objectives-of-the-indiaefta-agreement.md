    What are the main objectives of the India-EFTA Agreement?
answer: >-
    The India-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), signed on March 10, 2024, aims to establish a comprehensive free trade area between India and the EFTA member statesâ€”namely Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The main objectives of the agreement include:\n\n1. **Liberalization of Trade**: The agreement seeks to achieve the liberalization of trade in goods, in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This involves reducing tariffs and other trade barriers to facilitate smoother trade flows between India and EFTA countries.\n\n2. **Investment Promotion**: A significant aspect of the TEPA is the commitment from EFTA nations to invest $100 billion in India over the next 15 years. This investment is expected to be crucial for enhancing economic ties and creating job opportunities within India.\n\n3. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: The agreement is anticipated to generate approximately 1 million jobs in India, thereby contributing to economic growth and development.\n\n4. **Enhanced Supply Chain Resilience**: The TEPA aims to improve the integration and resilience of supply chains between India and EFTA countries, providing new opportunities for businesses and individuals on both sides.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The agreement encompasses 14 chapters that address various areas, including:\n   - Trade in Goods (including rules of origin and trade facilitation)\n   - Trade Remedies\n   - Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)\n   - Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)\n   - Trade in Services\n   - Investment Promotion\n   - Intellectual Property Rights\n   - Trade and Sustainable Development\n\n6. **Diversification of Trade Partners**: The TEPA is part of India's broader strategy to diversify its trade partners and reduce dependency on specific countries, particularly in light of the ongoing geopolitical dynamics.\n\nOverall, the India-EFTA TEPA represents a significant step towards strengthening economic relations, enhancing trade and investment flows, and fostering sustainable development between India and the EFTA member states.
