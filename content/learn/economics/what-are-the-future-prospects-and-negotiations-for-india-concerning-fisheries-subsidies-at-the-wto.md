    What are the future prospects and negotiations for India concerning fisheries subsidies at the WTO?
answer: >-
    India's future prospects and negotiations concerning fisheries subsidies at the World Trade Organization (WTO) are currently shaped by ongoing discussions and India's strategic positions. As of early 2024, during the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) held in Abu Dhabi, India has reiterated its commitment to responsible and sustainable fisheries practices, which are integral to its diverse fishing communities.\n\nIndia has emphasized the need for a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies that not only addresses overcapacity and overfishing but also protects the interests of small-scale fishers, particularly in developing countries. The country has proposed a 25-year exemption for developing nations from certain subsidy restrictions, arguing that this would prevent an unfair burden on these nations and allow them to develop their fisheries sectors sustainably.\n\nDespite India's relatively low level of fisheries subsidies—estimated at Rs. 22.25 billion in 2019, a 43% increase from 2016—its influence in the negotiations is significant. The country has called for a moratorium on subsidies provided by Distant Water Fishing Nations for activities beyond their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) for at least 25 years. This stance reflects India's concern about the impact of such subsidies on global fish stocks and the livelihoods of local fishers.\n\nThe negotiations have faced challenges, including a major impasse where India blocked progress on a deal, citing concerns that it would disproportionately affect developing countries. As the WTO continues to engage in discussions throughout 2023 and into 2024, the focus remains on achieving a balanced approach that considers the voices of coastal communities and the sustainability of fisheries.\n\nIn summary, India's future negotiations at the WTO regarding fisheries subsidies will likely continue to advocate for the protection of developing nations' interests while striving for sustainable fishing practices. The outcomes of these negotiations will be crucial for the future of global fisheries management and the livelihoods of millions dependent on this sector.
