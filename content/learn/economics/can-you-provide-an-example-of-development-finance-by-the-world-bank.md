answer: >-
    An example of development finance by the World Bank is the issuance of a sustainability-linked bond by the Development Bank of Rwanda, which was the world's first development bank to do so. This initiative is part of the World Bank's broader strategy to support sustainable development and financing mechanisms that align with environmental goals.\n\nAdditionally, the World Bank has approved projects to support institutions like TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey) and the Kenya Development Corporation in establishing green funds aimed at expanding equity financing for green business ventures. These efforts reflect the World Bank's commitment to mobilizing resources for sustainable development and addressing climate change through innovative financial instruments.\n\nAnother notable example is the issuance of a catastrophe bond that provides Jamaica with $185 million of insurance coverage for severe hurricanes. This financial instrument enhances the country's resilience against natural disasters by ensuring immediate access to funds in the aftermath of such events, showcasing the World Bank's role in disaster risk management and financial protection.\n\nThese examples illustrate the World Bank's approach to development finance, which emphasizes collaboration with local institutions and innovative financial solutions to address pressing development challenges.
