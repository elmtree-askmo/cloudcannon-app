    How has the international community reacted to India's stance on fisheries subsidies?
answer: >-
    The international community's reaction to India's stance on fisheries subsidies has been shaped by India's advocacy for the protection of its small-scale fishing communities and its call for equitable practices in global fisheries management. During the recent WTO negotiations, particularly at the Abu Dhabi Ministerial Conference-13, India emphasized its position as one of the lowest fisheries subsidizers despite its large population and the significant role of its artisanal fishing community.\n\nIndia has firmly opposed any restrictions on subsidies for its poor fishermen, arguing that such measures could exacerbate existing inequalities in the fishing sector. The country has called for a 25-year moratorium on subsidies provided by Distant Water Fishing Nations for activities beyond their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). This request highlights India's concern that large-scale industrial fishing practices, often supported by substantial subsidies from developed nations, threaten the sustainability of fish stocks and the livelihoods of small-scale fishers in developing countries.\n\nThe international community, particularly members of the WTO, has been engaged in ongoing discussions about fisheries subsidies since 2001, with the aim of reaching a global agreement to eliminate harmful subsidies. The landmark agreement reached in June 2022 reflects a collective effort to address these issues, but there are concerns that it may inadvertently impact small-scale fisheries in countries like India, which are crucial for poverty alleviation and food security.\n\nIndia's submissions to the WTO have pointed out critical gaps in the proposed agreements that could perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices, particularly among industrial fishing nations. The country has consistently advocated for a balanced approach that supports artisanal and small-scale fisheries while addressing the harmful practices of larger fishing operations.\n\nIn summary, India's stance has garnered attention and support from like-minded nations within the WTO, as it seeks to ensure that the outcomes of fisheries subsidies negotiations provide equitable support for its fishing communities and promote sustainable fishing practices globally.
