    What are the long-term economic benefits of integrating undocumented workers into the formal economy?
answer: >-
    Integrating undocumented workers into the formal economy can yield significant long-term economic benefits. Here are some key points highlighting these advantages:\n\n1. **Increased Tax Contributions**: Legalizing undocumented workers would substantially increase their tax contributions. For instance, estimates suggest that their total tax contributions could rise by $40.2 billion annually, bringing the total to approximately $136.9 billion. This increase is attributed to higher wages associated with legal employment and greater compliance with income tax laws.\n\n2. **Reduction of Long-term Deficits**: Reports indicate that undocumented workers contribute to reducing the long-term deficit of the country. In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid around $97 billion in taxes, including $34 billion in payroll taxes, which fund programs they are often excluded from benefiting from, such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\n3. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Providing a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship for undocumented immigrants could increase Americans' income by $791 billion and generate an additional $184 billion in state and local tax revenue. Furthermore, it is estimated that this integration could add more than 200,000 jobs to the U.S. economy each year.\n\n4. **Contribution to Local Economies**: Undocumented immigrants hold significant spending power, with estimates indicating that Mexican undocumented immigrants alone had over $82.2 billion in spending power after taxes. This spending often circulates within local economies, benefiting various sectors.\n\n5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Research from the Rice Universityâ€™s Baker Institute shows that for every dollar spent on public services for undocumented immigrants, the state collects $1.21 in revenue. This indicates that the economic contributions of undocumented workers outweigh the costs associated with the public services they utilize.\n\n6. **Labor Market Effects**: Granting legal status to undocumented workers is likely to improve their labor market outcomes, leading to better job opportunities and higher wages. This, in turn, can enhance overall economic productivity and growth.\n\nIn summary, integrating undocumented workers into the formal economy not only enhances tax revenues but also contributes to economic growth, job creation, and the overall fiscal health of the state and federal governments. The evidence suggests that the benefits of such integration significantly outweigh the costs, making it a compelling policy consideration.
