    What are the current trends in inflation globally and domestically?
answer: >-
    Current trends in inflation globally and domestically indicate a significant decline from the peaks observed in 2022. \n\n**Global Trends:**\nGlobal inflation is projected to decrease steadily, falling from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023, and further to 5.8% in 2024. This decline is attributed to tighter monetary policies and lower international commodity prices. The global economic growth rate is expected to slow from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024, which is below the historical average of 3.8% from 2000 to 2019. While risks to the economic outlook have become more balanced due to decisive actions by authorities in Switzerland and the U.S. to manage financial turbulence, they still lean towards the downside, indicating limited room for policy errors.\n\n**Domestic Trends (U.S.):**\nIn the United States, inflation has been on a downward trend since peaking in mid-2022. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 3.4% increase from December 2022 to December 2023, reflecting a significant disinflation of nearly 2 percentage points compared to the previous year. Factors contributing to this decline include improvements in supply chains, increased labor supply, and a decrease in retail gas prices, which fell from about $5 per gallon in mid-2022 to around $3. \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised interest rates significantly over the past year, with a cumulative increase of over 500 basis points. However, the pace of tightening has slowed recently, as the effects of previous rate hikes are still being assessed. The FOMC aims to bring inflation back to its target of 2% over time, and current projections suggest that the policy tightening already implemented will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation in the coming quarters.\n\nIn summary, both global and domestic inflation trends are characterized by a notable decline, influenced by monetary policy adjustments and external economic factors. The outlook remains cautious, with ongoing monitoring of economic indicators and potential risks.
