    How is the World Bank organized, and what are the roles of the Board of Governors and Executive Directors?
answer: >-
    The World Bank is organized as a cooperative of 189 member countries, which are also its shareholders. The governance structure of the World Bank consists primarily of two key bodies: the Board of Governors and the Executive Directors.\n\n### Board of Governors\n- **Composition**: The Board of Governors is made up of one governor from each member country, typically the country's minister of finance or minister of development.\n- **Role**: The Board of Governors serves as the ultimate policymaking body of the World Bank. They are responsible for making major decisions regarding the institution's operations and policies.\n- **Meetings**: The governors convene annually at the Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). During these meetings, they discuss current issues in international economics and finance, and they decide on the strategic direction of the World Bank.\n\n### Executive Directors\n- **Composition**: The Executive Directors are 25 in number, with the five largest shareholders (the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France) each appointing an Executive Director. Other member countries are represented by elected Executive Directors.\n- **Role**: The Executive Directors make up the Board of Directors of the World Bank and are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the institution. They oversee the Bank's business, including the approval of loans and guarantees, new policies, the administrative budget, country assistance strategies, and financial decisions.\n- **Meetings**: The Executive Directors typically meet at least twice a week to discuss and manage the Bank's operations. They work closely with the World Bank Group President, who chairs these meetings and is responsible for the overall management of the Bank.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the World Bank's governance structure is designed to ensure that member countries have a voice in its operations through the Board of Governors and the Executive Directors. The Board of Governors sets the strategic direction, while the Executive Directors manage the day-to-day activities, ensuring that the World Bank effectively fulfills its mission of reducing poverty and promoting economic development.
