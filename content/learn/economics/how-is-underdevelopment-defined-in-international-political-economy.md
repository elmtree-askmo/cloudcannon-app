    How is underdevelopment defined in international political economy?
answer: >-
    In the context of international political economy, underdevelopment is defined as a condition where a country or region experiences significant economic, social, and political limitations that prevent it from achieving a standard of living comparable to more industrialized nations. This state is often characterized by high poverty rates, low levels of industrialization, inadequate social services, and poor infrastructure. \n\nUnderdevelopment is frequently linked to historical processes such as colonialism and the exploitation of resources, which have created ongoing inequalities in the global economic system. These historical factors contribute to persistent poverty and hinder sustainable growth and self-sufficiency. The concept of underdevelopment is also critiqued within various theoretical frameworks, including dependency theory, which posits that the economies of poorer countries are structured in a way that keeps them dependent on wealthier nations, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.\n\nMoreover, underdevelopment is often assessed through benchmarks related to human development, such as macroeconomic growth, health, education, and living standards. The term itself has been a subject of debate, particularly in the context of international development policies that emerged after World War II, where it was framed within modernization theory and has since evolved to encompass a broader understanding of global inequalities and the dynamics of international relations. \n\nOverall, underdevelopment reflects a complex interplay of historical, economic, and social factors that continue to shape the experiences of countries in the Global South.
