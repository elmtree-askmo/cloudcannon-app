    What is Vertical Fiscal Imbalance (VFI) and why is it important in fiscal federalism?
answer: >-
    Vertical Fiscal Imbalance (VFI) refers to the discrepancy between the revenue-raising capabilities and expenditure responsibilities of different levels of government, particularly between central and state governments within a country. This imbalance is significant in the context of fiscal federalism, as it can lead to a reliance on intergovernmental transfers and borrowing by subnational governments to meet their expenditure needs.\n\nIn many cases, such as in India, states may incur a substantial portion of revenue expenditure—up to 61%—while only collecting about 38% of revenue receipts. This situation creates a dependency on transfers from the central government, which can distort fiscal federalism by undermining the financial autonomy of states and leading to inefficiencies in public service delivery.\n\nThe importance of VFI in fiscal federalism lies in its implications for accountability and fiscal discipline. Large vertical fiscal imbalances can relax fiscal discipline, making it challenging for subnational governments to maintain responsible budgeting practices. This can result in a lack of accountability, as local governments may not feel the pressure to generate their own revenues or manage their expenditures effectively.\n\nMoreover, addressing VFI is crucial for promoting cooperative federalism, where different levels of government work together efficiently. Reducing VFI can lead to a healthier fiscal environment, encouraging states to enhance their revenue-raising efforts and improve public service provision without excessive reliance on central government support.\n\nIn summary, VFI is a critical concept in fiscal federalism that highlights the need for a balanced approach to revenue and expenditure responsibilities among different levels of government, ensuring accountability and effective governance.
