    What are the projected ranges for inflation in the coming years?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the projected ranges for inflation in the coming years indicate a decline in overall inflation rates. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that overall inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is expected to decrease during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, ultimately reaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% by 2026.\n\nIn more detail, the inflation rate has already fallen from a peak of 7% year-over-year in June 2022 to approximately 3% as of October 2023. The expectation is that this downward trend will continue, driven by the resolution of supply chain issues and a slowdown in economic growth due to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening measures.\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America forecasts stable U.S. GDP growth at 2.3% for 2025, with inflation remaining sticky, suggesting that while inflation may decrease, it may not fall uniformly across all sectors. The overall expectation is for inflation to stabilize and potentially fall within the range of 3% to 4% in the near term, with a longer-term goal of reaching around 2% by 2026.\n\nIn summary, the projected inflation rates suggest a gradual decline, with specific targets indicating a return to the Federal Reserve's goal of 2% inflation by 2026.
