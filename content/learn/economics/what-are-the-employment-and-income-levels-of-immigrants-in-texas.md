    What are the employment and income levels of immigrants in Texas?
answer: >-
    In Texas, the employment and income levels of immigrants reflect their significant role in the state's economy. As of 2023, immigrants make up approximately 17.9% of the Texas population, and they represent a larger share of the workforce, comprising about 21.9% of the state's overall labor force. This indicates that immigrants are crucial to various industries and contribute substantially to the state's economic growth.\n\nNew immigrants arriving in Texas can expect to earn a median wage of around $20,000 per year. In households with two wage earners, the combined income would be approximately $40,000. Furthermore, the median household income for immigrants in Texas was reported to be around $75,500 in 2022, which is slightly higher than that of U.S.-born households, which stood at $74,600.\n\nThe immigrant population in Texas is diverse, with a significant number of undocumented workers. In 2016, undocumented immigrants accounted for about 8% of the Texas workforce. These individuals not only contribute to the economy through their labor but also pay substantial taxes. For instance, undocumented immigrants in Texas paid an estimated $2.6 billion in federal taxes and $1.6 billion in state and local taxes in 2018.\n\nOverall, the employment and income levels of immigrants in Texas highlight their vital contribution to the state's economy, both as workers and consumers, and underscore the importance of immigration in sustaining economic growth in the region.
