    How is price elasticity of demand calculated?
answer: >-
    To calculate the price elasticity of demand (PED), you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\nE_d = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}\n$$\n\nThis can also be expressed in a more detailed form as:\n\n$$\nE_d = \frac{\Delta Q / Q_0}{\Delta P / P_0}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\Delta Q$ is the change in quantity demanded,\n- $Q_0$ is the initial quantity demanded,\n- $\Delta P$ is the change in price,\n- $P_0$ is the initial price.\n\nTo calculate the percentage changes, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial price ($P_0$) and quantity demanded ($Q_0$).\n2. Determine the new price ($P_1$) and new quantity demanded ($Q_1$).\n3. Calculate the changes:\n   - Change in quantity demanded: $\Delta Q = Q_1 - Q_0$\n   - Change in price: $\Delta P = P_1 - P_0$\n4. Calculate the percentage changes:\n   - Percentage change in quantity demanded: $\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_0} \times 100$\n   - Percentage change in price: $\frac{\Delta P}{P_0} \times 100$\n5. Finally, plug these values into the elasticity formula.\n\nThe resulting value of $E_d$ indicates the elasticity of demand:\n- If $E_d > 1$, demand is elastic (consumers are highly responsive to price changes).\n- If $E_d < 1$, demand is inelastic (consumers are less responsive to price changes).\n- If $E_d = 1$, demand is unit elastic (percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price).\n\nFor example, if the price of a product increases from $9 to $7 and the quantity demanded changes from 10 units to 14 units, you would calculate the percentage changes and then apply the formula to find the price elasticity of demand. \n\nThis method provides a clear understanding of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to price changes, which is crucial for businesses and economists in making pricing decisions and understanding market dynamics.
