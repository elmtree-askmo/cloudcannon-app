    What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity when there is a rise in demand?
answer: >-
    When there is a rise in demand, represented by a rightward shift in the demand curve, the equilibrium price and quantity both increase. This phenomenon occurs because, at the original equilibrium price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. As a result, there is upward pressure on prices, prompting sellers to raise their prices. This process continues until a new equilibrium is established at a higher price and a higher quantity.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. **Equilibrium Price**: Increases due to higher demand.\n2. **Equilibrium Quantity**: Increases as suppliers respond to the higher demand by providing more goods or services.\n\nThis relationship can be illustrated as follows:\n\n- **Original Equilibrium**: At the initial price, the quantity demanded (Qd) is less than the quantity supplied (Qs).\n- **New Equilibrium**: As demand increases, the new quantity demanded (Qd') exceeds the original quantity supplied (Qs), leading to a new equilibrium price (P') and quantity (Q').\n\nIn conclusion, a rise in demand results in both a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity in the market.
