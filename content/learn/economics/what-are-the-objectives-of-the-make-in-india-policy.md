    The "Make in India" initiative, launched by the Government of India on September 25, 2014, aims to transform India into a global manufacturing hub by encouraging both domestic and foreign companies to manufacture their products within the country. The initiative is spearheaded by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Make in India policy include:\n\n1. **Boosting the Manufacturing Sector**: One of the main goals is to increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP from 16% to 25% by 2025. This is intended to enhance the overall economic growth of the country.\n\n2. **Job Creation**: The initiative aims to create 100 million new jobs in the manufacturing sector. This is to be achieved through skill development and enhancing the employability of the workforce.\n\n3. **Attracting Investments**: Make in India seeks to promote both domestic and foreign investment in the manufacturing sector, thereby making India a preferred destination for global investors.\n\n4. **Fostering Innovation**: The initiative emphasizes the importance of innovation and aims to create an ecosystem that encourages research and development in various sectors.\n\n5. **Building Infrastructure**: A significant focus is on developing world-class infrastructure to support manufacturing activities, which includes improving transportation, logistics, and industrial facilities.\n\n6. **Promoting Sustainable Practices**: The initiative also aims to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing by promoting the use of green technologies and sustainable practices.\n\n7. **Sectoral Focus**: Make in India covers 27 sectors, including electronics, automobiles, textiles, and defense, among others, to ensure a comprehensive approach to industrial development.\n\nOverall, the Make in India initiative is designed to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities, create jobs, and position the country as a global leader in manufacturing and innovation.
