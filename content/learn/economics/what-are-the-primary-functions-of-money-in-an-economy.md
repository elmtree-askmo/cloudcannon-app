    What are the primary functions of money in an economy?
answer: >-
    The primary functions of money in an economy can be categorized into four main roles:\n\n1. **Medium of Exchange**: Money facilitates transactions by serving as an intermediary in the exchange of goods and services. This function eliminates the inefficiencies of barter systems, where goods must be exchanged directly for other goods. With money, buyers can purchase what they need without having to find someone who wants to trade their goods for what they have.\n\n2. **Unit of Account**: Money provides a standard numerical unit of measure, which allows individuals and businesses to compare the value of different goods and services. This function simplifies pricing and accounting, making it easier to assess the value of items and make informed economic decisions.\n\n3. **Store of Value**: Money can be saved and retrieved in the future, maintaining its value over time. However, this function can be affected by inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of money. In times of high inflation, individuals may prefer to invest in assets that preserve value better than cash.\n\n4. **Standard of Deferred Payment**: Money is used to settle debts and obligations that are to be paid in the future. This function allows for credit transactions, where goods and services can be purchased now and paid for later, facilitating economic growth and investment.\n\nThese functions are fundamental to the operation of modern economies, supporting trade, investment, and overall economic stability.
