    What are the main concerns of Indian states regarding revenue under the GST regime?
answer: >-
    The main concerns of Indian states regarding revenue under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime primarily revolve around revenue shortfalls, fiscal autonomy, and the adequacy of compensation mechanisms. Here are the key issues:\n\n1. **Revenue Shortfalls**: The transition to the GST regime has led to concerns about potential revenue losses for states. The 15th Finance Commission report has acknowledged that the GST regime has not delivered on its early promises, resulting in states facing significant revenue shortfalls, especially during the pandemic. States have struggled to meet their financial obligations, including salary payments and capital expenditures, due to reduced tax revenues.\n\n2. **Compensation Mechanism**: To address initial revenue losses, the central government assured states of compensation through a GST compensation cess for a five-year period following the implementation of GST. However, as this compensation period comes to an end, states are increasingly worried about their ability to maintain revenue levels without this support.\n\n3. **Fiscal Autonomy**: The design of the GST has raised concerns about the fiscal autonomy of states. The subsuming of various state taxes into the GST framework has limited states' ability to generate revenue independently. This has led to apprehensions about the long-term sustainability of state finances and their capacity to fund essential services.\n\n4. **Uneven Consumption Growth**: Recent data indicates that consumption growth is not uniform across Indian states, which has implications for GST revenue collection. Some states may experience slower economic recovery, leading to disparities in revenue generation and further complicating fiscal management.\n\n5. **Impact of GST on State Finances**: The overall impact of GST on state finances is complex. While GST accounts for approximately 42% of states' own tax revenues, the actual revenue collected under the GST regime has been inconsistent. States have expressed concerns that the revenue generated may not be sufficient to cover their expenditures, particularly in light of the economic challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, Indian states are primarily concerned about the sustainability of their revenues under the GST regime, the adequacy of compensation mechanisms, and the implications for their fiscal autonomy and financial health. These issues highlight the need for ongoing dialogue between the central and state governments to address the challenges posed by the GST framework.
