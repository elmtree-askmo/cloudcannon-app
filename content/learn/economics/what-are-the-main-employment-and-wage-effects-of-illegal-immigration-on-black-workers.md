    What are the main employment and wage effects of illegal immigration on black workers?
answer: >-
    The impact of illegal immigration on black workers, particularly in terms of employment and wages, has been a subject of significant analysis and debate. A panel of experts presented evidence to the United States Commission on Civil Rights on April 4, 2008, highlighting the economic losses and job opportunity costs that black workers face due to illegal immigration.\n\nResearch conducted by economists such as George Borjas, Jeffrey Grogger, and Gordon Hanson indicates that illegal immigration has had notably negative effects on the wages and employment opportunities of black male high school dropouts. Their findings suggest that the influx of immigrants between 1980 and 2000 accounted for approximately 20% to 60% of the decline in wages for this demographic, with somewhat smaller effects observed for high school graduates. The study also noted minimal impacts on incarceration rates for either group.\n\nThe competition for jobs and income is intensified by the presence of an estimated 7.4 million illegal immigrant workers, who represent about one-third of the total foreign-born labor force. These workers compete directly with approximately 43 million adult members of the low-skilled labor force, which includes both native-born workers and other foreign-born individuals legally entitled to work.\n\nMoreover, the panelists emphasized that non-economic factors also contribute to the challenges faced by black workers, suggesting that the issue of immigration is multifaceted and cannot be viewed solely through an economic lens. The overall consensus from the panel and various studies indicates that illegal immigration has played a role in the economic struggles of black workers, particularly in low-skilled job markets.\n\nIn summary, the main employment and wage effects of illegal immigration on black workers include:\n\n1. **Wage Declines**: Significant reductions in wages for black male high school dropouts and, to a lesser extent, for high school graduates.\n2. **Employment Opportunities**: Increased competition for low-skilled jobs, leading to diminished job opportunities for black workers.\n3. **Non-Economic Factors**: Additional challenges that exacerbate the economic impact, which are not solely related to immigration.\n\nThese findings underscore the complexity of the relationship between illegal immigration and the labor market dynamics affecting black workers.
