    How has the National Food Security Act (NFSA) impacted PDS coverage?
answer: >-
    The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted in 2013, has significantly impacted the coverage and effectiveness of the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India. The NFSA aims to provide food security by ensuring access to adequate quantities of quality food at affordable prices, primarily through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). \n\nOne of the key features of the NFSA is its provision for individual entitlements, which guarantees 5 kg of food grains per person per month to approximately 82 crore individuals, thereby covering about two-thirds of the population. Specifically, the NFSA extends coverage to 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population, although as of 2022-23, only 59% of the total population was effectively covered by the PDS.\n\nPrior to the NFSA, the PDS faced significant challenges, including high levels of leakages—around 42% in 2011-12—where a substantial portion of the grains released by the Food Corporation of India did not reach the intended beneficiaries. The NFSA has aimed to address these inefficiencies by mandating reforms within the PDS, which include digitization of ration cards, computerized allocation of food grains, and the use of technology for tracking and monitoring the distribution process.\n\nDespite these improvements, challenges remain in the effective implementation of the NFSA and the PDS. Issues such as corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and regional disparities in implementation continue to affect the system's overall effectiveness. The NFSA has marked a paradigm shift in food security policy in India, transitioning the right to food from a general entitlement to a legal right, but ongoing assessments indicate that further reforms and improvements are necessary to fully realize its potential.
