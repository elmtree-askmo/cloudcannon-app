    What are the proposed features of the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) in India?
answer: >-
    The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) was introduced by the Government of India on August 24, 2024, and is set to come into effect from April 1, 2025. It aims to replace the National Pension System (NPS) and incorporates features reminiscent of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS). Here are the key features of the UPS:\n\n1. **Assured Pension**: The UPS guarantees retirees a pension amounting to 50% of their average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to retirement. This is applicable for employees who have completed a minimum qualifying service of 25 years. For those with shorter service periods, the pension will be proportionate, with a minimum requirement of 10 years of service.\n\n2. **Minimum Pension**: The scheme guarantees a minimum pension of â‚¹10,000 per month for employees who retire after completing at least 10 years of service.\n\n3. **Inflation Indexation**: The pension amounts, including the minimum pension and family pension, will be indexed to inflation, specifically linked to the All-India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW). This ensures that the purchasing power of the pension is maintained over time.\n\n4. **Family Pension**: The UPS includes provisions for family pensions, ensuring financial support for the dependents of the pensioner in the event of their death.\n\n5. **Government Contributions**: The government will contribute 18.5% towards the pension fund, enhancing the financial security of the scheme.\n\n6. **Portability and Flexibility**: The UPS is designed to be portable, allowing employees to transfer their pension benefits when they move between different government departments or positions.\n\n7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The UPS aims to consolidate various existing pension schemes into a more equitable and efficient system, benefiting approximately 23 lakh Central Government employees.\n\nThe introduction of the UPS is seen as a response to demands for revising the NPS and aims to provide greater financial security for government employees post-retirement.
