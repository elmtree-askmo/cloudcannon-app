    What were the main causes of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka in 2022?
answer: >-
    The economic crisis in Sri Lanka in 2022 was caused by a combination of several interrelated factors:\n\n1. **High Debt Levels**: Sri Lanka was burdened with unsustainable debt, which significantly strained its economy. The country had accumulated substantial foreign debt, and the inability to service this debt led to a severe balance of payments crisis.\n\n2. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic severely affected Sri Lanka's economy, particularly its tourism sector, which is a major source of revenue. The decline in tourism revenue exacerbated the existing economic vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Agricultural Policies**: The government's abrupt shift to organic farming in 2021, which included a ban on chemical fertilizers, led to a significant drop in agricultural output. This policy decision resulted in food shortages and increased reliance on imports, further straining foreign reserves.\n\n4. **Currency Devaluation**: The Sri Lankan rupee faced significant devaluation, which increased the cost of imports, including essential goods like food and fuel. This devaluation contributed to soaring inflation rates, which reached as high as 69.8% in September 2022.\n\n5. **Natural Disasters**: Sri Lanka experienced adverse weather conditions, including droughts and floods, which negatively impacted agricultural production and the overall economy.\n\n6. **Tax Structure Changes**: Changes to the tax structure in late 2019 reduced government revenue, limiting the fiscal space needed to respond to economic challenges. This lack of revenue made it difficult for the government to manage its debt and fund essential services.\n\n7. **Inflation and Economic Contraction**: The combination of these factors led to a historic contraction of the economy, with severe hardships for individuals and businesses. The crisis prompted widespread protests and calls for political change.\n\nIn summary, the economic crisis in Sri Lanka was a multifaceted issue driven by high debt, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, poor agricultural policies, currency devaluation, natural disasters, and inadequate fiscal management. These elements collectively led to a significant economic collapse, prompting the government to seek assistance from international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
