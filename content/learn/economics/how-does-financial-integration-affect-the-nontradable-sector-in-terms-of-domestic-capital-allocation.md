    How does financial integration affect the nontradable sector in terms of domestic capital allocation?
answer: >-
    Financial integration significantly impacts the non-tradable sector in terms of domestic capital allocation, particularly when considering the capital intensity of the non-tradable sector relative to the tradable sector. Here are the key points regarding this relationship:\n\n1. **Capital Intensity and Gains from Financial Integration**: If the non-tradable sector is relatively capital-intensive, the benefits derived from financial integration tend to increase with the size of this sector within a country. This suggests that a larger non-tradable sector can attract more capital flows, enhancing its growth and productivity.\n\n2. **Resource Allocation**: Financial integration allows for a more efficient allocation of resources between the tradable and non-tradable sectors. Banks and financial institutions can lend funds to both sectors, which can lead to a more balanced development. The ability to access international capital markets can help domestic firms in the non-tradable sector secure the necessary funding for expansion and innovation.\n\n3. **Impact on Capital Stocks and Income**: Studies indicate that capital per worker in a financially integrated country is influenced by the size and relative capital intensity of both sectors. This means that as financial integration deepens, the capital stocks in the non-tradable sector can increase, potentially leading to higher income per capita.\n\n4. **Macroeconomic Stability**: While financial integration can enhance capital allocation, it also introduces risks. The concentration of capital flows can lead to vulnerabilities in the non-tradable sector, especially if there are sudden shifts in investor sentiment or global economic conditions. This can affect macroeconomic stability and the overall health of the domestic economy.\n\n5. **Cross-Border Capital Flows**: Financial integration facilitates cross-border capital flows, which can benefit the non-tradable sector by providing access to a larger pool of investment. This can be particularly advantageous for sectors that are less exposed to international competition and rely more on domestic demand.\n\nIn summary, financial integration can enhance domestic capital allocation to the non-tradable sector, especially if that sector is capital-intensive. However, it is essential to manage the associated risks to ensure that the benefits of integration do not lead to economic vulnerabilities.
