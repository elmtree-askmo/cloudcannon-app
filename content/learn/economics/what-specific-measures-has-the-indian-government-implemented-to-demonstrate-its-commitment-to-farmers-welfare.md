    What specific measures has the Indian government implemented to demonstrate its commitment to farmers' welfare?
answer: >-
    The Indian government has implemented several specific measures to demonstrate its commitment to farmers' welfare, particularly through various schemes and initiatives aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and improving the livelihoods of farmers. Here are some key measures:\n\n1. **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Yojana**: This scheme provides financial assistance of ₹6,000 per year to farmers, disbursed in three equal installments through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). It primarily targets small and marginal farmers, helping them meet their agricultural expenses.\n\n2. **Soil Health Card (SHC)**: The SHC scheme aims to provide farmers with a detailed analysis of the nutrient content of their soil, along with recommendations for improving soil health and productivity. This initiative is crucial for sustainable farming practices.\n\n3. **Formation and Promotion of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)**: Launched in 2020, this scheme aims to form and promote 10,000 FPOs across the country. These organizations help farmers gain better access to markets, improve bargaining power, and enhance their income.\n\n4. **Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS)**: This scheme offers short-term crop loans up to ₹3 lakh at a subsidized interest rate of 7% per annum for one year, making credit more accessible to farmers.\n\n5. **Support for Startups in Agriculture**: The government has initiated the RKVY Agri-Startup Programme, which has provided grants-in-aid to support agricultural startups. This initiative encourages innovation and technology adoption in the agricultural sector.\n\n6. **Budgetary Allocations**: The Union Budget for the Financial Year 2023-24 has made significant provisions for agriculture and farmers' welfare, focusing on inclusive and comprehensive development.\n\n7. **Climate Resilience Initiatives**: The government is also working on preparing farmers for climate change challenges by promoting high-yielding and climate-resilient crop varieties, ensuring the agricultural sector remains robust against environmental shifts.\n\nThese measures reflect the Indian government's ongoing commitment to improving the agricultural sector and supporting farmers' welfare through financial assistance, technological support, and policy initiatives.
