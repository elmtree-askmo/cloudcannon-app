    What government policies affect soya bean procurement in Madhya Pradesh?
answer: >-
    The government policies affecting soybean procurement in Madhya Pradesh are primarily centered around the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the implementation of the Price Support Scheme (PSS). Here are the key aspects of these policies:\n\n1. **Minimum Support Price (MSP)**: For the kharif season of 2024-25, the MSP for soybean has been fixed at â‚¹4,892 per quintal. This price is intended to provide a safety net for farmers against market fluctuations and ensure they receive a fair price for their produce.\n\n2. **Procurement Schedule**: The Madhya Pradesh government has announced that soybean procurement will take place from October 25 to December 31, 2024. Farmers are required to register for procurement by October 15, with the registration process starting on September 25. This structured timeline is designed to facilitate organized procurement and ensure that farmers are aware of the process.\n\n3. **Procurement Centers**: The state government plans to establish 1,400 procurement centers to facilitate the buying of soybeans at the MSP. This initiative aims to make the procurement process more accessible to farmers across the state.\n\n4. **Oversight by Markfed**: The Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation (Markfed) will oversee the procurement process. This includes making necessary arrangements for the storage and handling of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) soybeans, ensuring that the quality standards are met.\n\n5. **Quantity Limits**: Under the PSS, the Madhya Pradesh government will procure a maximum quantity of 13.68 lakh tonnes of soybeans for the kharif 2024-25 season. This cap is set to manage the procurement process effectively and ensure that it aligns with market conditions and state resources.\n\n6. **Farmer Concerns**: There have been concerns among farmers regarding soybean prices falling below the MSP, prompting the government to respond to these issues by ensuring that procurement at the MSP is implemented effectively.\n\nThese policies reflect the Madhya Pradesh government's commitment to supporting soybean farmers and stabilizing the agricultural economy in the state. The implementation of these measures is crucial for addressing the challenges faced by farmers, including market volatility and climate change impacts on crop yields.
