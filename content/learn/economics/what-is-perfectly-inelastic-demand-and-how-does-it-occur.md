    What is perfectly inelastic demand and how does it occur?
answer: >-
    Perfectly inelastic demand refers to a situation where the quantity demanded of a good or service remains constant, regardless of changes in its price. This means that consumers will purchase the same amount of the product no matter how much the price increases or decreases. In graphical terms, this is represented by a vertical demand curve, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is equal to zero ($E_p = 0$).\n\nThis phenomenon typically occurs in cases where the product is a necessity and has no close substitutes. For example, life-saving medications like insulin for diabetics exemplify perfectly inelastic demand. Individuals who rely on insulin must purchase it regardless of price changes, as there are no alternative treatments available. Other examples may include essential goods such as certain types of food or water, where consumers cannot reduce their consumption even if prices rise significantly.\n\nIn summary, perfectly inelastic demand occurs under the following conditions:\n1. The good is a necessity with no substitutes.\n2. Consumers are willing to pay any price to obtain the good, as it is essential for their well-being or survival.\n3. The demand curve is represented as a vertical line, indicating that quantity demanded does not change with price fluctuations.
