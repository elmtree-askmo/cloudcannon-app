answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, a significant adjustment was made to the tax deduction on family pensions for pensioners. The deduction has been increased from ₹15,000 to ₹25,000. This change is expected to benefit over 4 crore salaried individuals and pensioners, providing them with additional financial relief.\n\nThe budget also introduced other tax-related changes, including an increase in the standard deduction for salaried employees from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000. These adjustments reflect the government's efforts to enhance the financial well-being of pensioners and salaried employees amidst a stable inflation environment.\n\nOverall, the increase in the family pension deduction is part of a broader strategy to provide tax relief and support to various segments of the population in the 2024-25 fiscal year.
