    Explain first-degree price discrimination with an example.
answer: >-
    First-degree price discrimination, also known as perfect price discrimination, is a pricing strategy where a seller charges each consumer the maximum price they are willing to pay for a good or service. This approach allows the seller to capture the entire consumer surplus, thereby maximizing profits by tailoring prices to individual customers' willingness to pay.\n\n### Example of First-Degree Price Discrimination\n\nConsider a monopolist selling a product to three different buyers, each with distinct reservation prices (the maximum they are willing to pay):\n\n- **1st buyer:** $10\n- **2nd buyer:** $7\n- **3rd buyer:** $5\n\nIn a scenario of first-degree price discrimination, the monopolist would charge each buyer their respective reservation price:\n\n- The 1st buyer would pay $10.\n- The 2nd buyer would pay $7.\n- The 3rd buyer would pay $5.\n\nBy doing so, the monopolist captures the entire consumer surplus, which is the difference between what each buyer is willing to pay and what they actually pay. In this case, the total revenue generated by the monopolist would be:\n\n$$\n\text{Total Revenue} = 10 + 7 + 5 = 22\n$$\n\nThis strategy is theoretically appealing because it allows the seller to maximize profits by ensuring that no consumer surplus is left unexploited. However, in practice, achieving perfect price discrimination is challenging due to the need for comprehensive consumer information and the difficulty in determining each individual's maximum willingness to pay.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile first-degree price discrimination can lead to higher profits for sellers, it is more of a theoretical concept than a common practice. The implementation requires detailed knowledge of each consumer's preferences and willingness to pay, which is often difficult to obtain. Additionally, consumers may feel unfairly treated if they discover they are paying different prices for the same product, leading to potential dissatisfaction and reputational risks for the seller.\n\nIn summary, first-degree price discrimination is a powerful pricing strategy that allows sellers to maximize profits by charging each consumer their maximum willingness to pay, but it comes with significant practical challenges and ethical considerations.
