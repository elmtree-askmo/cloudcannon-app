    How have recent economic policies in India affected the agricultural sector?
answer: >-
    Recent economic policies in India have had a significant impact on the agricultural sector, reflecting a complex interplay of support and challenges. Here are some key points regarding these effects:\n\n1. **Shift in Focus**: In recent years, India's economic policies have increasingly emphasized industrial advancement, which has led to a decline in agriculture's contribution to the GDP. This shift has raised concerns about the viability of agriculture as an economic option for many farmers, prompting calls for reforms to better support this sector.\n\n2. **Increased Budget Allocation**: The Indian government has demonstrated a farmer-centric focus by significantly increasing the budget for agriculture. From ₹1.37 lakh crore during 2007-14, the allocation rose to ₹7.27 lakh crore for 2014-25. This includes direct financial assistance to farmers through schemes like PM-KISAN, which has benefited over 11.8 crore farmers, providing substantial financial support.\n\n3. **Growth Rates**: The agricultural sector has shown resilience, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 4.6% over the last six years. In the fiscal year 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0%, indicating a steady, albeit modest, growth trajectory.\n\n4. **Support for Small Farmers**: The government's policies have prioritized small farmers, with initiatives aimed at enhancing their income and living standards. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism has also been crucial, with farmers receiving nearly ₹18 lakh crore for paddy and wheat crops over the last decade.\n\n5. **Challenges and Reforms**: Despite these positive developments, challenges remain, including over-exploitation of natural resources and the need for a more sustainable agricultural policy. The introduction of new farm laws in 2020 aimed to provide farmers with greater freedom to sell their produce and enter contracts, but these laws have also led to significant protests and debates about their implications for farmers' livelihoods.\n\n6. **Long-term Goals**: The National Agricultural Policy aims for sustainable development, food security, and increased farmers' income, with a target growth rate of over 4% per annum in the agricultural sector. This reflects a commitment to addressing the key issues facing agriculture in India.\n\nIn summary, while recent economic policies in India have provided substantial support to the agricultural sector, challenges persist that require ongoing reforms and a balanced approach to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of agriculture in the country.
