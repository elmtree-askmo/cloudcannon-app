    Can you elaborate on what causes a change in quantity demanded?
answer: >-
    A change in quantity demanded is primarily caused by a change in the price of the good or service, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus). This relationship is articulated by the law of demand, which states that, all else being equal, an increase in price typically leads to a decrease in quantity demanded, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is represented graphically by a downward-sloping demand curve.\n\nWhen the price of a good rises, consumers tend to buy less of it because the higher price may lead them to seek substitutes or reduce their overall consumption. Conversely, if the price falls, consumers are likely to purchase more of the good, as it becomes more affordable. This movement along the demand curve is what we refer to as a change in quantity demanded.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between a change in quantity demanded and a change in demand. A change in demand refers to a shift of the entire demand curve, which can occur due to various factors other than price, such as changes in consumer income, preferences, the prices of related goods (substitutes and complements), expectations about future prices, and the number of buyers in the market. For example, if consumer incomes increase, the demand curve may shift to the right, indicating an increase in demand at all price levels, while the quantity demanded at a specific price may also increase.\n\nIn summary, the primary cause of a change in quantity demanded is a change in the price of the good or service, while changes in demand are influenced by a broader set of factors.
