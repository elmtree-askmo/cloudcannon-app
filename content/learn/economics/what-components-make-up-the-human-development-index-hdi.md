    What components make up the Human Development Index (HDI)?
answer: >-
    The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic that measures a country's overall development based on three key components:\n\n1. **Health**: This is represented by life expectancy at birth. It reflects the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if current mortality rates continue to apply.\n\n2. **Education**: This component is assessed through two indicators:\n   - **Mean years of schooling**: The average number of years of education received by people aged 25 and older.\n   - **Expected years of schooling**: The total number of years of schooling that a child entering the education system can expect to receive, assuming that the current enrollment ratios remain the same throughout the child's life.\n\n3. **Income**: This is measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). It reflects the average income of a country's citizens and serves as an indicator of economic prosperity.\n\nThe HDI is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nHDI = \frac{1}{3}(I_{health} + I_{education} + I_{income})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $I_{health}$ is derived from life expectancy,\n- $I_{education}$ is based on the mean and expected years of schooling,\n- $I_{income}$ is based on GNI per capita.\n\nA higher HDI indicates a higher quality of life and better overall development in a country, as it encompasses not just economic factors but also health and education.
