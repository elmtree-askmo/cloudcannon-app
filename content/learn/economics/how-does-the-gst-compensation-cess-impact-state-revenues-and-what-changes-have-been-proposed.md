    How does the GST Compensation Cess impact state revenues and what changes have been proposed?
answer: >-
    The GST Compensation Cess was introduced under the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, to address the revenue shortfall experienced by states due to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Initially, this cess was intended to be levied for a period of five years, from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2022. However, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in the compensation requirements for the fiscal year 2020-21, while cess collections dropped.\n\nAs of the 49th GST Council meeting held on February 18, 2023, it was proposed that the compensation cess be extended beyond its original expiration date of March 31, 2026, to continue addressing the revenue gaps faced by states. The Council recommended that the entire outstanding GST Compensation Cess of â‚¹16,982 crores due to the states for June 2022 be cleared from the Central Government's resources and recouped from future cess collections.\n\nAdditionally, there have been discussions about changing the structure of the GST Compensation Cess from an ad valorem basis to a specific tax-based levy on certain products, such as pan masala and tobacco. This change aims to simplify the taxation process and potentially provide a more stable revenue stream for states.\n\nOverall, the consensus among states is that merging the compensation cess with the GST could offer a long-term solution to the impending expiry of the cess, thereby simplifying the taxation framework and ensuring that states continue to receive adequate revenue support. However, extending or embedding the cess into GST rates could raise legal challenges and affect public trust, as it would contradict the original promise of a finite cess period.
