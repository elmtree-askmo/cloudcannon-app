    What economic motivations and exploitation are highlighted in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," economic motivations and exploitation are central themes that reflect the brutal realities of colonialism during the Victorian era. The novella is set against the backdrop of the ivory trade, which serves as a primary economic driver for European imperialism in Africa. The pursuit of ivory, a highly valued commodity, illustrates the greed and exploitation inherent in colonial enterprises.\n\nThe character of Kurtz epitomizes this exploitation; he initially travels to the Congo with the intention of collecting ivory for the Company, motivated by a desire to prove his worth after facing rejection due to his poverty. This personal ambition is intertwined with the broader economic interests of the colonial powers, highlighting how individual aspirations can be corrupted by the lure of wealth and power.\n\nMoreover, the novella critiques the dehumanization of the native African population, who are subjected to brutal working conditions and exploitation by the colonizers. Marlow, the protagonist, witnesses the suffering of African workers, which starkly contrasts with the wealth being extracted from their land. This exploitation is not merely a backdrop but a critical commentary on the moral and psychological ramifications of colonialism, revealing the inherent darkness in human nature and the corrupting influence of power.\n\nOverall, "Heart of Darkness" serves as a profound critique of the economic motivations behind imperialism, exposing the brutal realities of exploitation and the moral decay that accompanies the pursuit of wealth at the expense of human dignity.
