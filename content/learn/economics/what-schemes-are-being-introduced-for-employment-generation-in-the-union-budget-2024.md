    In the Union Budget 2024-25, several schemes have been introduced to enhance employment generation. The key initiatives include:\n\n1. **Employment-Linked Incentive (ELI) Scheme**: This scheme is aimed at promoting job creation and is being implemented in a mission mode. The Union Minister of Labour & Employment, Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, emphasized the need for expeditious implementation of this scheme.\n\n2. **Three Specific Schemes under ELI**:\n   - **Scheme A**: Provides one month's salary support to enterprises hiring freshers. This is designed to incentivize companies to employ first-time job seekers.\n   - **Scheme B**: Focuses on job creation specifically in the manufacturing sector, encouraging businesses to expand their workforce.\n   - **Scheme C**: Offers support to employers, further incentivizing them to hire new employees.\n\n3. **Prime Minister's Package of 5 Schemes**: This comprehensive package aims to create employment and skilling opportunities for approximately 4.1 crore youth over a five-year period, with an allocation of ₹2 lakh crore. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance employment and skilling across various sectors.\n\n4. **Overall Budget Allocation**: The Union Budget allocates ₹1.48 lakh crore specifically for education, employment, and skilling, highlighting the government's commitment to improving job opportunities and workforce readiness.\n\nThese initiatives reflect the government's focus on employment generation, particularly for the youth, and aim to create a robust framework for job creation in the coming years.
