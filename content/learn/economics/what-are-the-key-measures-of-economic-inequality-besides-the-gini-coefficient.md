    What are the key measures of economic inequality besides the Gini coefficient?
answer: >-
    In addition to the Gini coefficient, there are several key measures of economic inequality that provide different perspectives on income distribution. Here are some of the most commonly used alternatives:\n\n1. **Lorenz Curve**: This graphical representation shows the proportion of total income earned by cumulative percentages of the population. The further the Lorenz curve is from the line of perfect equality (a 45-degree line), the greater the level of inequality.\n\n2. **Theil Index**: This measure decomposes inequality into within-group and between-group components, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of income distribution. It is sensitive to changes in the tails of the income distribution, making it useful for analyzing extreme income disparities.\n\n3. **Palma Ratio**: This ratio compares the share of income of the top 10% of earners to the bottom 40%. It emphasizes the disparity between the richest and the poorest segments of the population, providing a clear picture of income concentration.\n\n4. **Decile Ratios**: These ratios compare the income of the top decile (10%) to that of the bottom decile. For example, the ratio of the income of the top 10% to the bottom 10% can highlight extreme income disparities.\n\n5. **Atkinson Index**: This measure allows for the incorporation of societal aversion to inequality. It can be adjusted to reflect different levels of inequality aversion, making it a flexible tool for policymakers.\n\n6. **Head-Count Ratio**: Often used in poverty measurement, this ratio indicates the proportion of the population living below a certain income threshold. While it primarily focuses on poverty, it can also provide insights into overall economic inequality.\n\nThese measures, along with the Gini coefficient, contribute to a comprehensive understanding of economic inequality, each highlighting different aspects of income distribution and its implications for society.
