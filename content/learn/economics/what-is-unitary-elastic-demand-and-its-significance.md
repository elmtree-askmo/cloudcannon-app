    Unitary elastic demand is a market situation where the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal and opposite to the percentage change in price, resulting in a price elasticity of 1. This condition is significant for understanding its impact on total revenue and consumer behavior.

    What is unitary elastic demand and its significance?
answer: >-
    Unitary elastic demand, also known as unit elasticity, refers to a market condition where the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service is exactly equal to the percentage change in its price, but in the opposite direction. This means that if the price of a product increases by a certain percentage, the quantity demanded will decrease by the same percentage, and vice versa. In mathematical terms, the price elasticity of demand in this scenario is equal to 1.\n\nFor example, if the price of a product rises by 10%, the quantity demanded will fall by 10%. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nE_d = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in price}} = 1\n$$\n\nThe significance of unitary elastic demand lies in its implications for total revenue. When demand is unitary elastic, changes in price do not affect total revenue. This is because the increase in price is exactly offset by the decrease in quantity demanded, keeping total revenue constant. For instance, if a company raises the price of its product, the loss in sales volume will balance out the gain from the higher price, resulting in unchanged total revenue.\n\nUnderstanding unitary elastic demand is crucial for businesses and policymakers as it helps illustrate consumer behavior in response to price changes. It indicates a balanced responsiveness of consumers to price fluctuations, which can inform pricing strategies and economic policies.
