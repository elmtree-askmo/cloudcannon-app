    What is the cosmetic tax under the TRAIN Law?
answer: >-
    Under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law in the Philippines, a new excise tax was introduced specifically for invasive cosmetic procedures. This tax is set at 5% of the gross receipts derived from the performance of such procedures and surgeries. The provision for this tax was included in Section 150-A of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, through Republic Act No. 10963, which took effect on January 1, 2018.\n\nThe TRAIN Law, signed into effect by President Rodrigo Duterte on December 19, 2017, is part of a broader tax reform initiative aimed at improving the tax system in the Philippines. It encompasses various changes, including adjustments to personal income tax, estate tax, donor's tax, and excise taxes on several goods and services, including cosmetic procedures.\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) was responsible for releasing the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) for this new levy, which took some time after the law's enactment. The excise tax on cosmetic procedures is considered a nonessential service tax, reflecting the government's approach to taxing luxury or nonessential expenditures.\n\nIn summary, the cosmetic tax under the TRAIN Law is a 5% excise tax on the gross receipts from invasive cosmetic surgeries, aimed at generating additional revenue for the government while also targeting nonessential services.
