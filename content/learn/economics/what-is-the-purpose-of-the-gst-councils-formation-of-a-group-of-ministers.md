    What is the purpose of the GST Council's formation of a Group of Ministers?
answer: >-
    The purpose of the GST Council's formation of a Group of Ministers (GoMs) is to address complex issues related to the implementation and administration of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) across various sectors. The GST Council, which is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution, aims to ensure uniformity in GST administration and to tackle challenges that arise in its implementation.\n\nThe GoMs are specifically constituted to delve into intricate matters that require focused attention and expertise. As of now, 19 GoMs have been formed, with each tasked with examining specific issues and providing recommendations to the GST Council. This collaborative approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of sector-specific challenges and facilitates informed decision-making regarding GST rates, exemptions, and other related policies.\n\nIn summary, the formation of GoMs by the GST Council serves to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of GST administration by leveraging specialized knowledge and addressing sectoral complexities.
