    How is taxation addressed in Module 3, Unit 2?
answer: >-
    In Module 3, Unit 2, taxation is addressed through an analysis of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, which was enacted in 2017. The module provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of taxation in the Philippines, tracing its roots from pre-colonial times when tribes paid tributes to chieftains, through the Spanish era with the imposition of buwis, to the current tax system governed by the TRAIN Law.\n\nThe unit emphasizes the importance of understanding the benefits and challenges associated with the TRAIN Law. It encourages students to reflect on the law's goals, particularly its aim to improve the progressivity of the tax system. Students are instructed to analyze the implications of the law, considering both its intended and unintended consequences on society.\n\nAdditionally, the module includes activities that require students to fill out tables and answer questions related to the TRAIN Law, fostering critical thinking and engagement with the material. Overall, Module 3, Unit 2 serves as a vital resource for understanding the complexities of taxation in the context of Philippine history and its socio-economic implications.
