    What are the potential upside risks to the economic outlook?
answer: >-
    The potential upside risks to the economic outlook primarily revolve around the possibility of lower inflation and faster economic growth. These factors can create a more favorable environment for economic expansion than currently anticipated. Here are some key points regarding these upside risks:\n\n1. **Lower Inflation**: If inflation continues to decline more rapidly than expected, it could lead to increased consumer spending and business investment. This would enhance overall economic activity and potentially stimulate growth beyond current forecasts.\n\n2. **Faster Economic Growth**: There is a possibility that economic growth could exceed projections due to various factors, such as stronger-than-expected consumer demand, improvements in labor market conditions, or effective fiscal policies that stimulate investment.\n\n3. **Monetary Policy Adjustments**: As inflation eases, central banks may respond by lowering interest rates sooner than anticipated. This could further encourage borrowing and spending, contributing to economic growth.\n\n4. **Global Economic Conditions**: Improvements in global economic conditions, such as a recovery in major economies or stabilization in emerging markets, could also positively impact the U.S. economy, leading to higher growth rates.\n\n5. **Supply Chain Improvements**: If supply chain disruptions continue to resolve, this could lead to increased production capacity and efficiency, further supporting economic growth.\n\n6. **Fiscal Policy Support**: Continued or enhanced fiscal support from government policies could provide a boost to economic activity, especially in sectors that are still recovering from previous downturns.\n\nWhile these upside risks are balanced by potential downside risks, such as higher inflation or slower growth due to external shocks or policy missteps, the overall outlook remains cautiously optimistic. The balance of risks suggests that while there are challenges ahead, there are also significant opportunities for stronger economic performance.
