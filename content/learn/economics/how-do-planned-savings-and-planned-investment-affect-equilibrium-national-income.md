    How do planned savings and planned investment affect equilibrium national income?
answer: >-
    Planned savings and planned investment play a crucial role in determining the equilibrium national income within the framework of Keynesian economics. The equilibrium level of national income is achieved when planned savings (leakages) equal planned investment (injections). This relationship can be understood through several key points:\n\n1. **Equilibrium Condition**: The equilibrium national income is established at the point where aggregate demand (comprising consumption and investment) equals aggregate supply (the total output of the economy). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   Y_d = Y_s \n   $$\n   where $Y_d$ is the desired aggregate demand and $Y_s$ is the desired aggregate supply.\n\n2. **Graphical Representation**: In a graphical representation, the equilibrium is depicted at the intersection of the planned savings curve (SS) and the planned investment line (IÌ…). At this intersection, the level of national income is stable, meaning that any deviation from this point will lead to adjustments in output and income until equilibrium is restored.\n\n3. **Impact of Divergence**: If planned savings exceed planned investment, it results in a situation where expenditure is less than the output, leading to unplanned increases in inventories. Businesses will respond by reducing production, which in turn causes national income to fall. Conversely, if planned investment exceeds planned savings, it creates upward pressure on national income as businesses increase output to meet the higher demand.\n\n4. **Adjustment Mechanism**: The adjustment towards equilibrium occurs through changes in national income, which affect both savings and investment. For instance, an increase in national income typically leads to higher consumption and, consequently, higher savings. This process continues until planned savings and planned investment are equalized.\n\n5. **Keynesian Multiplier Effect**: The relationship between planned savings and investment is also influenced by the Keynesian multiplier effect. Changes in investment can lead to larger changes in national income due to the multiplier effect, which amplifies the initial change in spending throughout the economy.\n\n6. **Historical Context**: Keynesian economics emphasizes the importance of this equilibrium condition, contrasting it with classical economic theories that suggested automatic adjustments through interest rate changes. Keynes argued that in times of economic downturns, such as recessions, the divergence between savings and investment could persist without intervention.\n\nIn summary, planned savings and planned investment are fundamental to achieving equilibrium national income. The balance between these two components determines the overall economic activity, and any discrepancies lead to adjustments in output and income levels.
