    How has wealth distribution changed globally over the past few decades?
answer: >-
    Over the past few decades, global wealth distribution has undergone significant changes, reflecting both improvements and persistent challenges in inequality. Here are some key trends observed:\n\n1. **Decline in Extreme Poverty**: The percentage of adults in the lowest wealth segment (those with under $10,000) has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 2000 to 40% in 2023. This indicates a notable improvement in the financial status of a significant portion of the global population.\n\n2. **Growth of Middle Wealth Segment**: The group of individuals with wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 has seen substantial expansion over the same period. This shift suggests that more people are moving into a middle-income bracket, which can be seen as a positive development in wealth distribution.\n\n3. **Gini Coefficient Trends**: The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has shown a decline from 68.7 in 2013 to 64.9 in recent years, indicating a reduction in global income inequality. However, it remains high, suggesting that while inequality has decreased, it is still a significant issue.\n\n4. **Between-Country Inequality**: There has been a decrease in between-country inequality, particularly as countries like China and India have experienced rapid economic growth. This has contributed to a narrowing of the wealth gap between nations.\n\n5. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**: Recent data suggests that global inequality may have increased again due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic exacerbated existing disparities, leading to a more unequal distribution of wealth in the aftermath.\n\n6. **Persistent Low-Income Country Challenges**: Despite some improvements, low-income countries have seen little change in their share of global wealth, remaining below 1% from 1995 to 2018, despite accounting for about 8% of the world's population. This highlights ongoing challenges in addressing poverty and inequality in these regions.\n\nIn summary, while there have been positive trends in wealth distribution globally, such as a decrease in extreme poverty and a growing middle class, significant challenges remain, particularly in low-income countries and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall picture is one of mixed progress, with ongoing efforts needed to address the disparities that persist.
