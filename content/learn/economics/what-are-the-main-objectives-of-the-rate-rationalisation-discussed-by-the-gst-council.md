    What are the main objectives of the rate rationalisation discussed by the GST Council?
answer: >-
    The main objectives of the rate rationalization discussed by the GST Council, particularly during its 45th meeting held on September 17, 2021, include:\n\n1. **Simplification of the Rate Structure**: The GST Council aims to create a more straightforward and understandable tax rate structure, which can help businesses and consumers alike.\n\n2. **Correction of Inverted Duty Structure**: This involves addressing situations where the tax rate on inputs is higher than the tax rate on the final product, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs for manufacturers.\n\n3. **Reduction of Classification-Related Disputes**: By rationalizing rates, the Council seeks to minimize disputes arising from the classification of goods and services, which can often lead to litigation and confusion.\n\n4. **Enhancement of GST Revenues**: A more rationalized rate structure is expected to improve compliance and increase overall GST revenues, benefiting the economy.\n\n5. **Boost to Economic Growth**: Rationalizing GST rates is anticipated to stimulate consumption and investment, particularly by lowering rates on essential commodities, which could reduce the cost of living and increase disposable income for consumers.\n\nThese objectives reflect the GST Council's commitment to ensuring a fair, efficient, and effective tax system that supports economic growth and simplifies compliance for taxpayers.
