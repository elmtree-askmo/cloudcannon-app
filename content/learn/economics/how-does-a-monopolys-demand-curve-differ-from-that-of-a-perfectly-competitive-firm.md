    How does a monopoly's demand curve differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm?
answer: >-
    In comparing the demand curves of a monopoly and a perfectly competitive firm, several key differences emerge due to the distinct market structures they operate within.\n\n### Demand Curve in Monopoly\n1. **Market Demand Curve**: A monopolist faces the entire market demand curve, which is typically downward sloping. This means that as the monopolist lowers the price, the quantity demanded increases. Since the monopolist is the sole provider of a product with no close substitutes, it has significant control over the price. The demand curve for a monopolist is the same as the industry demand curve.\n\n2. **Price Control**: The monopolist can influence the market price by adjusting the quantity of the product it supplies. To sell more units, the monopolist must lower the price, which affects all units sold, leading to a marginal revenue (MR) that is less than the average revenue (AR):\n   $$\n   MR < AR\n   $$\n\n### Demand Curve in Perfect Competition\n1. **Perfectly Elastic Demand Curve**: In contrast, a perfectly competitive firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve, which is horizontal at the market price. This is because there are many firms selling identical products, and consumers can easily switch to another supplier if one firm raises its price. Therefore, the individual firm is a price taker and cannot influence the market price.\n\n2. **Revenue Equality**: For a perfectly competitive firm, the average revenue (AR) is equal to the market price, and the marginal revenue (MR) is also equal to the price. Thus, the MR curve coincides with the demand curve:\n   $$\n   MR = AR = P\n   $$\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Shape of Demand Curve**: The monopolist's demand curve is downward sloping, while the perfectly competitive firm's demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal).\n- **Price Influence**: A monopolist has the power to set prices based on the quantity supplied, whereas a perfectly competitive firm must accept the market price.\n- **Revenue Relationships**: In a monopoly, marginal revenue is less than average revenue, while in perfect competition, marginal revenue equals average revenue.\n\nThese differences highlight the fundamental characteristics of monopolistic and perfectly competitive markets, influencing their pricing strategies, revenue functions, and overall market behavior.
