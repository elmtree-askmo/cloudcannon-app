    How are resolutions passed at adjourned meetings handled?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, specifically Section 116, resolutions passed at adjourned meetings are treated as having been passed on the date they were actually passed. This provision applies to various types of meetings, including those of the company itself, the holders of any class of shares, or the Board of Directors.\n\nTo elaborate, if a meeting is adjourned due to a lack of quorum or for any other reason, and a resolution is subsequently passed at the adjourned meeting, that resolution is considered valid and effective as of the date it was passed, rather than the original date of the meeting. This ensures that the decisions made during the adjourned meeting are recognized for all legal and operational purposes.\n\nFor example, if a company's annual general meeting (AGM) is adjourned from March 23 to April 1 due to insufficient quorum, any resolutions passed on April 1 will be deemed to have been passed on that date, not on March 23. This provision helps maintain clarity and continuity in the decision-making process of the company.\n\nIn summary, Section 116 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides a clear framework for handling resolutions passed at adjourned meetings, ensuring they are treated as valid from the date of their passage.
