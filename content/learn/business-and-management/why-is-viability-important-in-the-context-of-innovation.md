    Why is viability important in the context of innovation?
answer: >-
    Viability is a critical aspect of innovation, particularly in the context of design thinking and product development. It refers to the ability of an organization to sustain its innovations in the marketplace, ensuring that they are not only profitable but also capable of generating a return on investment (ROI). Here are several reasons why viability is important in the context of innovation:\n\n1. **Sustainable Business Model**: Viability ensures that an innovative product or service can compete effectively in the marketplace. Without a solid financial model, even the most innovative ideas can fail to gain traction. Organizations must assess whether their innovations can improve revenue streams and ultimately lead to profit.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: Evaluating viability helps identify potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the success of a product. By conducting a thorough risk assessment, organizations can make informed decisions about which ideas to pursue, thereby reducing the likelihood of costly failures.\n\n3. **Alignment with Business Goals**: Before investing resources into the design and development of a product, it is essential to determine if the idea aligns with the organization's budget and long-term goals. This alignment ensures that the innovation contributes to the overall strategy of the business.\n\n4. **Framework for Evaluation**: The desirability, viability, and feasibility (DVF) framework popularized by Tim Brown at IDEO serves as a guide for assessing ideas during the innovation process. This framework emphasizes that for an innovation to be successful, it must meet the needs of users (desirability), be feasible to implement (feasibility), and be financially viable (viability).\n\n5. **Long-Term Success**: Innovations that are only focused on short-term profits without considering long-term viability often lead to failure. Companies that neglect this aspect may find themselves unable to sustain their innovations in a competitive environment, ultimately jeopardizing their market position.\n\nIn summary, viability is essential for ensuring that innovations are not only creative and user-centered but also sustainable and profitable in the long run. By integrating viability assessments into the design thinking process, organizations can enhance their chances of successful innovation.
