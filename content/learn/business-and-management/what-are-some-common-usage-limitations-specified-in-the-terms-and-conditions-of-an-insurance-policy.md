    What are some common usage limitations specified in the terms and conditions of an insurance policy?
answer: >-
    Common usage limitations specified in the terms and conditions of an insurance policy typically include the following:\n\n1. **Geographical Limitations**: Coverage is often restricted to specific geographical areas. For instance, in vehicle insurance, the coverage may only apply within India.\n\n2. **Usage Restrictions**: The policy may specify that the vehicle cannot be used for certain activities, such as:\n   - Hire or reward (using the vehicle for commercial purposes).\n   - Organized racing or speed testing.\n   - Carriage of goods for hire.\n   - Motor trade activities.\n\n3. **Driver Eligibility**: The policy may limit who is allowed to drive the insured vehicle. Generally, only individuals with a valid driving license are permitted, and there may be additional stipulations regarding learner's licenses.\n\n4. **Policy Voidance Conditions**: The policy may become void if certain conditions are not met, such as:\n   - The premium cheque not being realized.\n   - Cases of misrepresentation or fraud by the insured.\n\n5. **Deductibles**: There may be a compulsory deductible amount that the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance coverage applies. For example, a deductible of â‚¹100 may be specified.\n\n6. **Exclusions**: Specific conditions or circumstances under which the insurer will not provide coverage are outlined. Common exclusions include:\n   - Driving without a valid license.\n   - Use of the vehicle in violation of the policy terms.\n\n7. **No-Claim Bonus**: The policy may include a no-claim bonus provision, which offers a discount on the premium for not making any claims during the previous policy period. If claims are made, this bonus may be forfeited.\n\n8. **Changes Upon Renewal**: The terms and conditions may be subject to change upon renewal of the policy, which means that the insured should review the new terms carefully.\n\n9. **Avoidance of Certain Terms and Right of Recovery**: The policy may include clauses that allow the insurer to avoid certain terms or recover costs under specific circumstances.\n\nThese limitations are crucial for the insured to understand, as they define the scope of coverage and the responsibilities of both the insurer and the insured. It is advisable for policyholders to read the terms and conditions thoroughly to ensure compliance and to avoid any surprises during the claims process.
