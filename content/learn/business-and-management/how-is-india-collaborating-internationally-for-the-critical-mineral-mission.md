    How is India collaborating internationally for the Critical Mineral Mission?
answer: >-
    India is actively collaborating internationally for its Critical Mineral Mission, which was announced as part of the Budget 2024-25. This mission aims to enhance domestic production and recycling of critical minerals such as copper and lithium, which are essential for technological advancements and renewable energy sectors.\n\nOne of the key international collaborations is India's participation in the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), a US-led initiative that includes 13 countries and the European Union. This partnership focuses on establishing secure and sustainable supply chains for critical minerals. As part of this initiative, India is involved in co-investing in lithium resource projects in South America and rare earth deposits in Africa, which are crucial for diversifying mineral supply chains.\n\nAdditionally, India has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Energy Agency (IEA) to strengthen cooperation in the critical minerals sector. This agreement aims to provide India with access to reliable data, analysis, and policy recommendations, enhancing its strategies for critical minerals.\n\nIndia is also exploring partnerships with countries rich in critical minerals, such as Kazakhstan, with whom it has partnered to produce titanium slag. This collaboration is part of a broader strategy to secure long-term access to critical minerals through bilateral, minilateral, and multilateral agreements.\n\nOverall, India's approach to international collaboration in the Critical Mineral Mission is multifaceted, focusing on building expertise, enhancing trade and market access, and ensuring a steady supply of essential minerals for its economic development and energy transition.
