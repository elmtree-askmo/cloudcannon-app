    How does Airtable's customer support compare to other similar tools?
answer: >-
    Airtable's customer support is generally regarded as strong, featuring a comprehensive knowledge base, step-by-step guides, and a responsive support team. Users can also engage with a vibrant community where they share tips and solutions on forums and social media. However, comparisons with similar tools reveal some limitations.\n\nFor instance, while Airtable has received positive reviews, it appears to lag behind competitors like ClickUp in terms of customer support. ClickUp has been noted for its superior customer service, which includes quicker response times and more robust support options. Users have reported that Airtable's support can be slow, with response times sometimes reaching 24 hours, even for those on enterprise plans. This has led to some frustration, particularly when users encounter issues with automations or other critical features.\n\nIn summary, while Airtable offers solid customer support, it may not be as responsive or comprehensive as that of some of its competitors, such as ClickUp. This could be a consideration for potential users when evaluating their options.
