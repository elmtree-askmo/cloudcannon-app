    What are India's current defence export policies?
answer: >-
    India's current defence export policies have been significantly shaped by strategic government initiatives aimed at enhancing self-reliance in defence production while simultaneously increasing its presence in the global arms market. Here are some key aspects of these policies:\n\n1. **Record Growth in Defence Exports**: India achieved a historic milestone in defence exports, reaching approximately ₹21,083 crore (around $2.63 billion) in the fiscal year 2023-24. This marks a 32.5% increase from the previous fiscal year and represents a substantial growth trajectory over the past decade, with exports increasing nearly 30-fold since 2013-14.\n\n2. **Policy Initiatives**: The Indian government has implemented several policy measures to boost defence exports. These include:\n   - **Streamlined Export Procedures**: The introduction of online procedures and portals for export authorisation has simplified the process for defence manufacturers.\n   - **Defence Lines of Credit (LOCs)**: These are extended to foreign governments, facilitating the import of Indian-made defence products.\n   - **Focus on Private Sector Participation**: The government encourages private sector involvement in defence production, which has contributed significantly to export figures.\n\n3. **Export Authorisation**: The Ministry of Defence has delegated powers to the Department of Defence Production to issue export licenses under the Arms Rules 2016. This includes parts and components of small arms, which further supports the export framework.\n\n4. **Diverse Export Portfolio**: India's defence exports include a variety of products, such as anti-air systems, with notable deals like the ₹6,000 crore agreement to export an anti-air system to Armenia.\n\n5. **Global Positioning**: India has transitioned from being the world's second-largest arms importer (2015-2019) to securing a place among the top 25 arms exporting nations. This shift reflects the effectiveness of the government's policies and the growing capabilities of the Indian defence industry.\n\n6. **Future Outlook**: The Economic Survey 2023-24 indicates that with continued efforts from both public and private sectors, India is well-positioned to further enhance its defence exports while maintaining its status as a major arms importer.\n\nThese policies and initiatives collectively aim to not only bolster India's defence capabilities but also to establish it as a competitive player in the global arms market.
