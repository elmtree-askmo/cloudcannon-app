    What is the process for the passing of property in unascertained goods as per Section 23?
answer: >-
    According to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the process for the passing of property in unascertained goods is primarily governed by Section 23, which outlines specific conditions under which ownership can transfer from the seller to the buyer.\n\n1. **Ascertainment of Goods**: As per Section 18, property in unascertained goods does not pass to the buyer until the goods are ascertained. This means that the goods must be identified and specified in some manner before ownership can transfer.\n\n2. **Conditions for Passing of Property**: Section 23 provides two important rules regarding the passing of property in unascertained goods:\n   - **Sale by Description**: If there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods by description, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the goods of that description are in a deliverable state and are unconditionally appropriated to the contract by either the buyer or the seller, with the consent of the other party. This appropriation can be expressed or implied.\n   - **Consent**: The consent for appropriation can occur either before or after the contract is made, indicating that both parties must agree on the specific goods being sold.\n\nIn summary, the passing of property in unascertained goods requires that the goods be ascertained and that there is mutual consent regarding their appropriation. This ensures that both parties are clear on the specific goods involved in the transaction, thereby facilitating a smooth transfer of ownership.
