answer: >-
    The Innovators Growth Platform (IGP) is a specialized framework established by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018. Launched in 2019, the IGP aims to facilitate capital raising and listing for startups and new-age firms that are heavily reliant on technology and innovation, such as those in sectors like information technology, biotechnology, and data analytics.\n\n### Purpose and Objectives of the Innovators Growth Platform:\n\n1. **Encouragement of Startups**: The IGP is designed to support startups in accessing capital markets more easily. Startups often face significant challenges in raising funds due to their early-stage nature and unique business models. The IGP provides a dedicated platform for these companies to raise funds from a diverse range of investors.\n\n2. **Enhanced Visibility and Prestige**: By listing on the IGP, startups can gain greater credibility and visibility in the market. This enhanced financial status can lead to increased demand for their shares and potentially higher valuations.\n\n3. **Regulatory Framework**: The IGP operates under a regulated environment, ensuring that the companies listed on the platform adhere to specific eligibility criteria and disclosure requirements. This regulatory oversight helps protect investors and fosters trust in the market.\n\n4. **Accessibility for Investors**: The IGP broadens the eligibility criteria for investors, allowing a wider range of accredited investors to participate in the funding of startups. This includes provisions that have been amended to make it easier for investors to hold a stake in these companies.\n\n5. **Facilitating Growth**: The platform is particularly beneficial for growth-oriented startups, providing them with an avenue for equity infusion that can be crucial for scaling their operations and expanding their market presence.\n\nIn summary, the Innovators Growth Platform serves as a vital tool for fostering the growth of startups in India by providing them with a structured and supportive environment to raise capital, gain visibility, and enhance their credibility in the market.
