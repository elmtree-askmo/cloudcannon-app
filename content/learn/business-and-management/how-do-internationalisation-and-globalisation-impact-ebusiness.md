    How do internationalisation and globalisation impact e-business?
answer: >-
    Internationalisation and globalisation significantly impact e-business in various ways, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and larger corporations. Here are some key points regarding their influence:\n\n1. **Market Expansion**: Globalisation has opened up new markets for e-businesses, allowing companies to reach customers across the globe. For instance, a small business in China can easily sell products to customers in Europe or North America through online platforms like Alibaba or Amazon. This expansion increases customer reach and potential sales.\n\n2. **Cost Reduction**: Digitalisation, a key component of e-business, lowers the costs associated with doing business abroad. By leveraging online platforms and digital tools, companies can reduce operational costs and streamline their internationalisation processes.\n\n3. **Speed and Scope of Internationalisation**: The advancement of digital technologies accelerates the speed at which firms can internationalise. E-business facilitates quicker access to international markets and allows for a broader scope of operations, enabling firms to adapt to global demands more efficiently.\n\n4. **Differential Effects on B2B and B2C**: Globalisation has different impacts on business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. Highly global firms tend to engage more in B2B transactions, while B2C activities are often more localized. This suggests that the nature of the business model influences how globalisation affects e-business strategies.\n\n5. **Digital Skills and Organisational Innovation**: The successful internationalisation of e-businesses is contingent upon embedding e-business technologies within the organisational processes and investing in digital skills. Companies that prioritize these aspects are more likely to benefit from globalisation.\n\n6. **Challenges of Digital Internationalisation**: While globalisation presents opportunities, it also introduces challenges. The rapid pace of digital innovation creates a competitive landscape where born-digital firms must differentiate themselves. Traditional international business strategies may not suffice in addressing the complexities of digital internationalisation.\n\n7. **Changing Business Models**: The rise of e-business has transformed traditional business models, emphasizing the use of data and online systems. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of how internationalisation is perceived and executed.\n\nIn summary, internationalisation and globalisation are reshaping the landscape of e-business by expanding market opportunities, reducing costs, and altering business models. However, they also require businesses to adapt their strategies and invest in digital capabilities to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving global market.
