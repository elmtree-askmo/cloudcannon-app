    What are the three lenses of innovation in design thinking?
answer: >-
    The "Three Lenses of Innovation" is a framework developed by IDEO that integrates human-centered design with considerations of technological and economic feasibility. This approach emphasizes the importance of balancing three critical criteria to achieve successful innovation: desirability, viability, and feasibility.\n\n1. **Desirability**: This lens focuses on the user's needs and wants. It assesses whether the proposed solution is appealing and useful to the end-users. A successful innovation must resonate with users, ensuring that it addresses their actual problems and desires.\n\n2. **Viability**: This aspect examines the business implications of the innovation. It ensures that the solution can be sustained within the existing market structures and that it provides a viable business model. The innovation must not only meet user needs but also be economically sound for the organization.\n\n3. **Feasibility**: This lens evaluates whether the proposed solution can be realistically implemented. It considers the technical and operational aspects, ensuring that the innovation can be delivered within reasonable costs and with the available resources.\n\nIn summary, for an innovation to be successful, it must meet all three lenses: it should be desirable for users, viable for the business, and feasible to implement. This framework helps teams identify the "innovation sweet spot," where user needs align with business goals and practical execution capabilities.
