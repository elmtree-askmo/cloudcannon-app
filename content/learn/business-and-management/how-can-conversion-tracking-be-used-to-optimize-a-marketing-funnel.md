Hereâ€™s how conversion tracking can be utilized to enhance the performance of a marketing funnel:\n\n1. **Understanding Conversion Rates**: By tracking the conversion rate, which indicates the percentage of users who complete a desired action (such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter), marketers can identify how well their funnel is performing. A low conversion rate may signal issues within the funnel, such as ineffective calls to action (CTAs) or barriers in the user experience.\n\n2. **Identifying Traffic Sources**: Conversion tracking allows marketers to analyze traffic by source (e.g., organic search, paid ads, social media).
