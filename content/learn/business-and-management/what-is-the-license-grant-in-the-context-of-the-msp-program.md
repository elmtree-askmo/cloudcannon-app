    What is the License Grant in the context of the MSP program?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Managed Service Provider (MSP) program, the License Grant refers to the permissions and rights granted to the MSP to use specific software or services under defined terms and conditions. This typically includes the scope of use, limitations, and obligations that the MSP must adhere to when utilizing the licensed products.\n\nFor instance, an MSP License is governed by the terms outlined in the agreement, which may specify that the license can only be used to support a particular client as indicated in an order. This means that the MSP cannot use the license to support any other client without explicit permission. Additionally, the license may include restrictions on actions such as decompiling, decrypting, or modifying the licensed software.\n\nThe License Grant is crucial for ensuring that the MSP operates within the legal framework established by the software provider, thereby protecting both the provider's intellectual property and the MSP's ability to deliver services to its clients effectively.
