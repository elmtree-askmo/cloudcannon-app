    What are the limits of liability coverage in a vehicle insurance policy?
answer: >-
    The limits of liability coverage in a vehicle insurance policy are crucial as they define the maximum amount the insurer will pay for claims resulting from injuries and damage to other people or property. Based on the gathered information, here are the key points regarding liability coverage limits:\n\n1. **Third-Party Property Damage**: The document specifies a liability coverage limit of ₹100,000 for damage to third-party property. This means that if the insured is found liable for causing damage to someone else's property, the insurance will cover up to this amount.\n\n2. **Injury Claims**: While the gathered information does not specify limits for bodily injury claims, typically, liability coverage also includes limits for injuries caused to third parties. These limits can vary significantly based on the policy and the insurer.\n\n3. **Legal Costs**: Liability coverage often includes legal costs associated with defending against claims. However, the extent of coverage for legal fees may also be subject to specific limits outlined in the policy.\n\n4. **Compulsory Deductible**: There is a compulsory deductible of ₹100, which is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance coverage applies. This deductible can affect the overall payout in the event of a claim.\n\n5. **Limitations on Use**: The policy may have restrictions on how the vehicle can be used, which can impact liability coverage. For example, if the vehicle is used for purposes not covered by the policy (like racing or commercial use), the liability coverage may not apply.\n\n6. **Geographical Area**: The liability coverage is applicable within India, which means that claims arising from incidents outside this geographical area may not be covered.\n\nIn summary, while the specific limit for third-party property damage is ₹100,000, other aspects of liability coverage, such as limits for bodily injury and legal costs, may vary and should be reviewed in the policy terms. Always consult the specific insurance policy for detailed limits and conditions.
