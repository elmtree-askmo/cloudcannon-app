    What is Property 360 and how does it relate to CoreLogic's data assets?
answer: >-
    Property 360 is a comprehensive application developed by CoreLogic that serves as a single system for managing various aspects of real estate transactions, particularly focusing on expense reimbursement and the confirmation of REOgrams (Real Estate Owned notifications) with Fannie Mae. It is designed to streamline processes for servicers by applying automation and real-time data, which helps reduce manual data entry and improve efficiency.\n\nCoreLogic's 360 Property Data is integral to Property 360, as it provides the underlying property data, insights, and technology that power the application. This data suite includes a unique identifier for each property, known as the CoreLogic Integrated Property Number (CLIP), which allows for consistent tracking of properties through various changes such as mergers and subdivisions. The 360 Property Data also encompasses a wide range of information, including property characteristics, market trends, and climate risk analytics, which can be leveraged to enhance decision-making in real estate transactions.\n\nIn summary, Property 360 utilizes CoreLogic's extensive data assets to facilitate a more efficient and informed approach to managing real estate transactions, ultimately benefiting servicers and stakeholders in the property ecosystem.
