    How has ICICI Bank responded to the allegations against the SEBI Chairperson?
answer: >-
    ICICI Bank has firmly denied the allegations made by the Congress party regarding Madhabi Puri Buch, the current Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The allegations claim that Buch continued to receive a salary from ICICI Bank after her retirement on October 31, 2013, and that she held an "office of profit" while serving as a whole-time member of SEBI since 2017.\n\nIn response to these allegations, ICICI Bank stated that it has not paid any salaries or granted Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to Buch after her retirement. Specifically, the bank clarified that between 2017 and 2024, Buch allegedly received an income of â‚¹16.80 crore from the ICICI Group, which the Congress party argues raises serious questions about potential conflicts of interest, as this amount is significantly higher than her income from SEBI.\n\nThe bank's response emphasized that all allegations regarding payments to Buch are false, and it reiterated that she did not receive any financial benefits from the bank or its group companies post-retirement. This controversy has sparked significant political discourse, with the Congress party expressing strong discontent over ICICI Bank's rebuttal of their claims.
