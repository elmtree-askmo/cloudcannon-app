    What is the definition of collaborative leadership?
answer: >-
    Collaborative leadership is defined as an inclusive leadership style that emphasizes teamwork, cooperation, and shared responsibility among team members. It involves gathering input and ideas from various sources before making decisions or taking action, positioning the leader more as a facilitator than an isolated director. This management practice encourages active participation from all team members and values the diverse perspectives they bring to the table.\n\nIn collaborative leadership, leaders work alongside employees at all levels, fostering an environment of open communication and trust-building. This approach not only enhances decision-making but also promotes a culture of cooperation and collective achievement within organizations. By prioritizing collaboration, organizations led by collaborative leaders are likely to develop agile, innovative, and high-functioning teams that can make a lasting impact across industries.\n\nOverall, collaborative leadership is essential for modern workplaces, as it extends beyond traditional leadership models by emphasizing inclusivity and participatory decision-making, ultimately leading to improved productivity and engagement.
