    What role do refugees play in entrepreneurship in the U.S.?
answer: >-
    Refugees play a significant role in entrepreneurship in the United States, contributing positively to the economy and local communities. According to a study by New American Economy, in 2019, approximately 13% of refugees in the U.S. were entrepreneurs, which is notably higher than the entrepreneurship rates of both U.S.-born citizens (9%) and non-refugee immigrants (11.7%). This trend highlights the unique entrepreneurial spirit among refugees, who often leverage their experiences and resilience to establish businesses in their new host country.\n\nIn 2015, there were over 180,000 refugee entrepreneurs in the U.S., generating around $4.6 billion in business income. By 2019, this number had increased to nearly 188,000 refugee entrepreneurs, who collectively generated approximately $5.1 billion in business revenue. This demonstrates not only the growing presence of refugees in the entrepreneurial landscape but also their substantial economic contributions.\n\nRefugees often face unique challenges due to their forced displacement, which can influence their entrepreneurial journeys. However, these challenges can also foster resilience and innovation, leading to successful business ventures. By the time refugees have been in the U.S. for 20 years, their median household income can reach $71,400, surpassing the median income of U.S. households overall.\n\nOverall, refugee entrepreneurship is a vital component of the U.S. economy, driving job creation, community development, and economic growth. The positive impact of refugees as entrepreneurs underscores the importance of supporting refugee resettlement and integration efforts, as they not only enrich the cultural fabric of society but also contribute significantly to the economic vitality of the nation.
