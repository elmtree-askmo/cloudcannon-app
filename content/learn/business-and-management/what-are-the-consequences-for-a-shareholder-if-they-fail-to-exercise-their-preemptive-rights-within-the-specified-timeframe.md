    What are the consequences for a shareholder if they fail to exercise their preemptive rights within the specified timeframe?
answer: >-
    If a shareholder fails to exercise their preemptive rights within the specified timeframe, the primary consequence is the potential dilution of their ownership interest in the corporation. Preemptive rights are designed to protect existing shareholders from having their percentage of ownership reduced when new shares are issued. \n\nFor example, if a corporation issues additional shares and a shareholder does not exercise their preemptive rights, they may miss the opportunity to purchase a proportionate number of the new shares. As a result, their ownership percentage in the corporation will decrease. \n\nTo illustrate this with a scenario: consider a corporation with 10,000 outstanding shares, where a shareholder owns 1,000 shares, representing 10% ownership. If the corporation decides to issue an additional 10,000 shares and the shareholder does not exercise their preemptive rights to purchase their share of the new issuance (in this case, 1,000 shares), their ownership will be diluted from 10% to 5% once the new shares are sold to other investors.\n\nIn summary, the consequences of not exercising preemptive rights include:\n\n1. **Dilution of Ownership**: The shareholder's percentage of ownership in the corporation decreases.\n2. **Loss of Voting Power**: A reduced ownership percentage may also lead to diminished voting power in corporate matters.\n3. **Potential Financial Impact**: The overall value of the shareholder's investment may decrease if their ownership stake is significantly diluted.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for shareholders to be aware of their preemptive rights and act within the designated timeframe to protect their interests in the corporation.
