    What are the allegations against PVH Corp. in the investigation by China?
answer: >-
    In September 2024, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) initiated an investigation into PVH Corp., the parent company of well-known fashion brands such as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The investigation is based on allegations that PVH Corp. violated normal market trading practices by refusing to source cotton from the Xinjiang region. This refusal is viewed by the Chinese authorities as an unjust boycott of Xinjiang cotton, which they claim lacks factual basis and has harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.\n\nThe investigation falls under China's Unreliable Entity List (UEL) regime, which targets foreign companies that are perceived to undermine China's interests. MOFCOM has stated that PVH's actions could be seen as seriously damaging to China's sovereignty, security, and development interests. The ministry has assured that PVH's rights to present statements and defenses will be fully protected throughout the investigation process.\n\nThis situation highlights the ongoing tensions between international businesses and Chinese regulations, particularly concerning issues related to human rights and trade practices in regions like Xinjiang.
