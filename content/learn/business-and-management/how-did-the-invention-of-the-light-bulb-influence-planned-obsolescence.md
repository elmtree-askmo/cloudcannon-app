    How did the invention of the light bulb influence planned obsolescence?
answer: >-
    The invention of the light bulb, particularly the commercially viable version developed by Thomas Edison around 1880, significantly influenced the concept of planned obsolescence, especially through the actions of the Phoebus cartel in the early 20th century. \n\nPlanned obsolescence is a strategy where products are designed with a limited lifespan, compelling consumers to repurchase them after they fail. The light bulb serves as a prominent example of this practice. The Phoebus cartel, which operated from 1925 to 1939, is often cited as a key player in establishing this strategy within the lighting industry. The cartel set a standard that limited the lifespan of incandescent light bulbs to approximately 1,000 hours, a reduction from the previously common lifespan of 1,500 to 2,000 hours. This deliberate shortening of product life was aimed at increasing sales frequency, ensuring that consumers would need to buy replacement bulbs more often.\n\nThe cartel's actions not only exemplified planned obsolescence but also set a precedent for manufacturing practices that prioritized profit over product longevity and consumer value. By artificially capping the lifespan of light bulbs, the cartel effectively created a market where continuous sales were guaranteed, thus embedding the concept of planned obsolescence into the consumer electronics industry.\n\nThe documentary "The Light Bulb Conspiracy" explores these themes, highlighting the historical context and the environmental consequences of such practices. It features interviews with historians and economists, shedding light on the broader implications of planned obsolescence beyond just the light bulb industry.\n\nIn summary, the light bulb's invention and the subsequent actions of the Phoebus cartel played a crucial role in shaping the practice of planned obsolescence, influencing not only consumer behavior but also the manufacturing strategies of various industries.
