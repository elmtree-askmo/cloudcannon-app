    How has India responded to political changes in its neighborhood?
answer: >-
    India's response to political changes in its neighborhood has been shaped by its "Neighbourhood First" policy, which emphasizes building strong relationships and promoting regional cooperation. This policy has become increasingly relevant in light of recent political upheavals in countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which have introduced complexities into India's diplomatic strategies.\n\n1. **Support for Stability**: India has recognized the need to support stability in its neighboring countries, particularly in Bangladesh, where the resignation of the Prime Minister and the interim governance by the military have raised concerns about regional volatility. India aims to engage constructively to mitigate potential refugee influxes and economic spillover effects that could arise from such instability.\n\n2. **Countering External Influence**: The rise of Chinese influence in the region poses a strategic challenge for India. In the Maldives, for instance, India is focused on countering radicalization and maintaining its influence against Chinese inroads while navigating the Maldives' internal political dynamics. This reflects India's broader strategy to secure its interests in the Indian Ocean and maintain regional security.\n\n3. **Bilateral Engagements**: India's diplomatic efforts include high-level meetings with leaders from neighboring countries. For example, recent discussions between India's External Affairs Minister and the President of the Maldives highlighted the complementary nature of their respective "Neighborhood First" and "India First" policies, aiming to enhance their special partnership.\n\n4. **Development Cooperation**: The "Neighbourhood First" policy is characterized by a consultative, non-reciprocal, and outcome-oriented approach. India focuses on delivering benefits such as improved connectivity, infrastructure development, and stronger cooperation in various sectors, which are essential for fostering goodwill and trust among its neighbors.\n\n5. **Addressing Domestic Challenges**: India's foreign policy is also influenced by its domestic political landscape. The complexities of domestic politics can impact India's ability to effectively engage with its neighbors, as seen in the challenges posed by political changes within the region.\n\nIn summary, India's response to political changes in its neighborhood is multifaceted, involving diplomatic engagement, support for stability, countering external influences, and a commitment to development cooperation. The evolving geopolitical landscape necessitates a pragmatic approach to ensure that India's interests are safeguarded while promoting regional stability and cooperation.
