    How do trade and strategic partnerships play a role in India's Act East Policy?
answer: >-
    India's Act East Policy (AEP) plays a crucial role in enhancing trade and strategic partnerships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Launched in 2014, the AEP is a diplomatic initiative that builds upon the earlier Look East Policy, which began in 1992. The primary aim of the AEP is to promote economic, strategic, and cultural relations with East and Southeast Asian nations.\n\nOne of the significant aspects of the AEP is its focus on economic integration and trade. For instance, when India initiated the Look East Policy, its trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was approximately USD 2 billion. Following the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with ASEAN in 2010, this figure surged to USD 72 billion by 2017-18, highlighting the substantial growth in trade relations. ASEAN has since become India's fourth-largest trading partner, underscoring the importance of this region in India's foreign trade strategy.\n\nThe AEP emphasizes the "4C's": Culture, Commerce, Connectivity, and Capacity building. This framework aims to strengthen not only economic ties but also cultural exchanges and infrastructural connectivity, which are essential for facilitating trade. The establishment of a dedicated mission to ASEAN and the East Asia Summit in Jakarta in 2015 further illustrates India's commitment to enhancing its diplomatic and economic engagement in the region.\n\nStrategically, the AEP allows India to counterbalance China's influence in the Asia-Pacific. By fostering partnerships with countries like Japan and South Korea, which are significant sources of foreign investment, India aims to enhance its economic development and security architecture in the region. The strategic partnership with ASEAN, formalized in 2012, has also enabled India to participate actively in multilateral organizations such as the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation and BIMSTEC, which focus on environmental, economic, and security cooperation.\n\nIn summary, trade and strategic partnerships are central to India's Act East Policy, facilitating economic growth and enhancing India's geopolitical influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy not only aims to boost trade volumes but also seeks to create a robust framework for long-term strategic cooperation with key regional players.
