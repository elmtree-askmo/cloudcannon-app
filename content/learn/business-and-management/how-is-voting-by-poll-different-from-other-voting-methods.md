    How is voting by poll different from other voting methods?
answer: >-
    Voting by poll is distinct from other voting methods, particularly voting by show of hands, in several key ways:\n\n1. **Method of Voting**: In voting by show of hands, members express their votes by raising their hands, which is a public and open method. This means that the votes are visible to all present, and proxies cannot vote in this scenario. In contrast, voting by poll involves distributing ballot papers to members, allowing them to cast their votes in private. This method ensures that each member's vote is confidential.\n\n2. **Voting Power**: Voting by poll operates on the principle of "one share, one vote," meaning that the voting power is proportional to the number of shares held by each member. This allows shareholders with a larger number of shares to have a greater influence on the outcome of the vote. Conversely, voting by show of hands does not account for the number of shares held, which can lead to situations where a small number of members can sway the decision despite holding fewer shares collectively.\n\n3. **Democratic Representation**: The results of a poll are generally considered to be more democratic, as they reflect the preferences of all shareholders who have cast their votes, regardless of the number of shares they hold. This contrasts with voting by show of hands, where the outcome may not accurately represent the overall sentiment of the shareholders, especially in larger companies where a few vocal members can dominate the discussion.\n\n4. **Usage Context**: Voting by poll is often called when the results of a show of hands are inconclusive or when a more accurate representation of shareholder opinion is required. The chair of the meeting can demand a poll, or it can be requested by shareholders meeting certain criteria, such as holding a specific percentage of voting rights.\n\n5. **Outcome Declaration**: The results of a poll can be declared immediately at the meeting or later, depending on the time required to count the votes. This flexibility is not typically available with voting by show of hands, where results are usually announced right away.\n\nIn summary, voting by poll provides a more structured and equitable approach to decision-making in company meetings, ensuring that the influence of shareholders is proportionate to their investment, while also maintaining the confidentiality of individual votes.
