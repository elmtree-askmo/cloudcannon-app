    How has Canadian trade evolved with Europe over the years?
answer: >-
    The evolution of Canadian trade with Europe has a rich history that spans several centuries, marked by significant milestones and agreements that have shaped the current economic landscape.\n\n1. **Historical Foundations**: Trade relations between Canada and Europe date back to the 1700s, rooted in the Age of Discovery when European explorers sought North America's natural resources. The fur trade was a major commercial activity in the 18th century, establishing early economic ties.\n\n2. **19th and Early 20th Century Developments**: In the late 19th century, trade expanded to include manufactured goods, particularly from Britain. The advent of trans-Atlantic steamships in the early 20th century facilitated easier transportation of goods, further enhancing trade volumes.\n\n3. **Post-World War II Era**: Following World War II, Canada experienced a significant increase in trade with Europe, coinciding with the expansion of global trade. This period saw Canada relying heavily on exports and imports to support its economy, with trade representing about 65% of its output, one of the highest ratios among G7 countries.\n\n4. **Formal Agreements**: The relationship was formalized through various agreements, starting with the Framework Agreement on Economic Co-operation signed in 1976 between Canada and the European Economic Community (EEC). This was the first formal agreement of its kind between the EEC and an industrialized third country.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)**: A significant milestone in recent years was the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in 2016, which was provisionally implemented in September 2017. CETA has led to a notable increase in trade, with Canadian merchandise imports from the EU rising by 28.4% to $67.5 billion in 2021. The agreement has also encouraged a growing number of Canadian firms to engage in trade with the EU.\n\n6. **Current Trends**: The trade relationship continues to evolve, with Canada now having 15 free trade agreements in place, covering 51 countries and representing over 60% of global GDP. The Canada-EU relationship is characterized by a deep strategic partnership based on shared values and commercial interests.\n\nIn summary, Canadian trade with Europe has evolved from early resource-based exchanges to a complex and multifaceted economic relationship, significantly influenced by historical ties, formal agreements, and ongoing globalization trends.
