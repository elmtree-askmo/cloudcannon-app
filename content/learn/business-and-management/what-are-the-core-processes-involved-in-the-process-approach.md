    What are the core processes involved in the process approach?
answer: >-
    The core processes involved in the process approach, as outlined in the ISO 9001:2015 standard, focus on understanding and managing interrelated activities to achieve desired outcomes effectively. Here are the key components of the process approach:\n\n1. **Identification of Processes**: Organizations must identify the core processes that contribute to the quality of their products or services. This includes understanding the inputs, outputs, and interdependencies of each process.\n\n2. **Process Mapping**: Documenting procedures for each identified process is essential. This mapping helps visualize how processes interact and ensures that all activities are aligned with the organization's objectives.\n\n3. **Management of Processes**: Each process should be managed and controlled to ensure consistent and predictable results. This involves defining responsibilities, authorities, and the necessary resources for each process.\n\n4. **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle**: The process approach incorporates the PDCA cycle, which is a systematic method for continuous improvement. Organizations should plan their processes, execute them, check the results, and act on the findings to enhance performance.\n\n5. **Risk-Based Thinking**: Organizations are required to apply risk-based thinking throughout the process approach. This means identifying risks and opportunities related to processes, products, and services, and determining how to address them to improve outcomes and prevent undesirable results.\n\n6. **Performance Evaluation**: Regular monitoring and measurement of process performance are crucial. This includes setting objectives, evaluating results, and implementing corrective actions as necessary to ensure processes remain effective.\n\n7. **Continuous Improvement**: The process approach emphasizes the need for ongoing improvement of processes. Organizations should take actions to enhance process performance continually, adapting to changes in the environment and stakeholder needs.\n\nBy adopting these core processes, organizations can create a robust quality management system that not only meets ISO 9001:2015 requirements but also drives overall performance and customer satisfaction.
