    How has the internet affected supply chain management?
answer: >-
    The internet has significantly transformed supply chain management (SCM) in various ways, enhancing operational efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness. Here are some key impacts:\n\n1. **Real-time Tracking and Monitoring**: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled businesses to track and monitor their supply chains in real-time. This capability allows companies to have a clear view of inventory levels, shipment statuses, and overall supply chain performance, which is crucial for making informed decisions.\n\n2. **Cost Reduction**: The use of the internet in SCM has dramatically reduced costs associated with order processing. Before the internet, order processing accounted for approximately 18% to 20% of total supply chain management costs. With online order placement and status tracking, companies can streamline these processes, leading to significant savings.\n\n3. **Enhanced Transportation Management**: Transportation is typically one of the highest costs in a supply chain, often accounting for about 25% of overall operating costs. The internet facilitates better management of transportation logistics, allowing for more efficient routing, scheduling, and monitoring of shipments, which can lead to reduced costs and improved service levels.\n\n4. **Demand-Driven Production**: Companies like Dell have leveraged the internet to adopt a build-to-order model, which allows them to customize products based on customer specifications. This approach minimizes the need for finished-goods inventories and reduces the risk of overproduction, as products are made only when there is a confirmed order.\n\n5. **Increased Transparency and Accessibility**: The internet has improved transparency within supply chains, enabling logistics and SCM professionals to access information quickly and efficiently. This accessibility allows for better decision-making and enhances collaboration among supply chain partners.\n\n6. **Fluid Supply Webs**: The traditional hierarchical supply chains are evolving into more fluid and distributed supply webs. This shift encourages new strategic approaches to demand and supply planning, allowing organizations to be more agile and responsive to market changes.\n\n7. **IoT Integration**: The IoT plays a crucial role in modern SCM by automating and digitalizing processes. By equipping physical assets with sensors, companies can monitor the status of goods and materials throughout the supply chain, leading to improved accuracy and operational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the internet has revolutionized supply chain management by enabling real-time visibility, reducing costs, enhancing transportation logistics, and fostering a more responsive and agile supply chain environment. These advancements not only improve operational efficiencies but also enhance customer satisfaction through faster and more reliable service.
