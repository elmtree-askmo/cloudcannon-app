answer: >-
    The PM Vishwakarma Scheme, launched on September 17, 2023, by the Indian government, is a significant initiative aimed at supporting Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), particularly focusing on artisans and craftspeople. This scheme is designed to provide comprehensive and holistic support to these individuals, often referred to as "Vishwakarmas," who work with their hands and tools.\n\nKey features of the PM Vishwakarma Scheme that support MSMEs include:\n\n1. **Collateral-Free Credit**: The scheme offers easy access to collateral-free credit of up to ₹3 lakh at a competitive interest rate of 5% per annum for a duration of four years. This financial support is crucial for MSMEs to invest in their businesses and enhance their operations.\n\n2. **Skill Training**: The scheme includes provisions for skill upgradation through basic and advanced training programs. Artisans can receive training lasting from 5 to 15 days, along with a stipend of ₹500 per day during the training period. This helps improve their skills and productivity.\n\n3. **Modern Tools and Toolkit Incentives**: Beneficiaries of the scheme are provided with modern tools and equipment, which are essential for enhancing their productivity and the quality of their products.\n\n4. **Digital Transaction Incentives**: The scheme encourages artisans to adopt digital transactions by providing incentives, thereby promoting financial inclusion and modern business practices.\n\n5. **Market Linkage Support**: The PM Vishwakarma Scheme facilitates market access for artisans and craftspeople, helping them to connect with potential buyers and expand their market reach.\n\n6. **Recognition**: Artisans and craftspeople receive a PM Vishwakarma certificate and ID card, which not only recognizes their skills but also enhances their credibility in the market.\n\n7. **Udyam Assist Platform**: The scheme includes access to the Udyam Assist platform, which provides additional support and resources for MSMEs.\n\nOverall, the PM Vishwakarma Scheme aims to uplift the traditional artisan community by providing them with the necessary tools, training, and financial support to thrive in a competitive market, thereby contributing to the growth and development of the MSME sector in India.
