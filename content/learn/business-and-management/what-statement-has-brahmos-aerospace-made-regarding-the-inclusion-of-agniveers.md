    What statement has BrahMos Aerospace made regarding the inclusion of Agniveers?
answer: >-
    BrahMos Aerospace has made a significant announcement regarding the inclusion of Agniveers, the new recruits under the Indian armed forces' Agnipath scheme. The company has stated that it will reserve at least 15% of its technical and general administration vacancies for Agniveers. This initiative marks BrahMos Aerospace as the first public sector unit (PSU) and public defense sector unit (PDSU) to implement such reservations.\n\nIn its formal statement, BrahMos Aerospace emphasized that Agniveers can become valuable assets for the organization, which is focused on nation-building and advancing defense capabilities. The company plans to recruit Agniveers not only for technical and administrative roles but also for security and administrative functions, where it has outsourced tasks. Additionally, industry partners associated with BrahMos Aerospace are encouraged to adopt similar hiring practices, thereby extending opportunities for Agniveers across the defense sector.\n\nThis move is seen as a structured pathway for Agniveers to enter the defense industry, addressing concerns about their employment after completing their service.
