    What is the FDI policy for the space sector in India?
answer: >-
    The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy for the space sector in India has undergone significant amendments recently, particularly with the introduction of the Indian Space Policy 2023. Here are the key aspects of the updated FDI policy:\n\n1. **100% FDI Allowed**: The Union Cabinet has approved amendments that permit up to 100% FDI in the space sector. This is aimed at attracting foreign investment and fostering a more inclusive environment for international players in the Indian space industry.\n\n2. **Automatic Route**: Under the amended policy, foreign investors can invest in the space sector without requiring prior approval from the Government of India. This automatic route simplifies the investment process and lowers entry barriers for foreign companies.\n\n3. **Categories of Investment**: The space sector has been categorized into different segments, with defined limits for foreign investment in each. This includes satellite-related activities, launch vehicles, and associated systems or subsystems.\n\n4. **Liberalization of Previous Restrictions**: Previously, the space sector was primarily under a 100% government route for FDI. The recent amendments have liberalized these restrictions, allowing for greater participation from the private sector and foreign investors.\n\n5. **Growth of Space Economy**: The amendments are expected to catalyze the growth of India's space economy, which was valued at approximately $8.4 billion in 2023. The government aims to enhance technology transfers and collaborative research in space technology through these reforms.\n\n6. **Support for Start-ups**: The Indian space sector has seen a significant increase in the number of start-ups, growing from just one in 2014 to 189 in 2023. The revised FDI policy is designed to further support this burgeoning ecosystem.\n\nThese changes reflect India's commitment to becoming a global player in the space industry and to harnessing the potential of private sector participation in space activities.
