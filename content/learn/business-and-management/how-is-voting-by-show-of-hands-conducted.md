    How is voting by show of hands conducted?
answer: >-
    Voting by show of hands is a method of decision-making used during general meetings of companies, as outlined in Section 107 of the Companies Act, 2013. Hereâ€™s how it is conducted:\n\n1. **Default Method**: Voting by show of hands is the default method for resolutions put to vote at any general meeting, unless a poll is demanded under Section 109 or the voting is conducted electronically.\n\n2. **Procedure**: During the meeting, the chairman will typically ask those in favor of the resolution to raise their hands. After a brief pause, the chairman will then ask those opposed to raise their hands as well. This allows for a visual tally of votes.\n\n3. **Declaration of Results**: The chairman will declare the results based on the number of hands raised. This declaration is considered sufficient evidence of the passing or failing of the resolution.\n\n4. **Voting Rights**: Each shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote. This means that the voting rights are equal regardless of the number of shares held, which is a key aspect of this method.\n\n5. **Limitations**: While voting by show of hands is efficient for small groups, it may not be suitable for larger meetings where visibility can be an issue. In such cases, if the outcome is unclear or contested, a poll may be demanded to ensure a more accurate count.\n\n6. **Documentation**: The results of the voting by show of hands must be recorded in the minutes of the meeting, along with the chairman's declaration.\n\nThis method is straightforward and allows for quick decision-making, but it is essential to ensure that all participants can clearly see the voting process to maintain transparency and fairness.
