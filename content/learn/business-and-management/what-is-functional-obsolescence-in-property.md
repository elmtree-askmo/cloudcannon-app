    What is functional obsolescence in property?
answer: >-
    Functional obsolescence in property refers to a reduction in a property's usefulness or desirability due to outdated design features, inefficient technology, or poor condition that cannot be easily remedied. This concept is particularly significant in real estate appraisal, as it can lead to a decline in property value.\n\nAccording to the Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, functional obsolescence is defined as "the impairment of functional capacity of a property according to market tastes and standards." This means that as market preferences evolve, certain features of a property may become less desirable or useful, resulting in a depreciation of its value. For example, an office building constructed in the 1970s or 80s that has not been updated may exhibit functional obsolescence due to its outdated layout or design.\n\nThere are generally three types of functional obsolescence:\n\n1. **Curable Functional Obsolescence**: This refers to deficiencies that can be easily fixed or updated, such as repairing roof damage or renovating an outdated living room.\n\n2. **Incurable Functional Obsolescence**: This type involves issues that cannot be easily remedied, such as a property with a layout that is fundamentally outdated compared to newer homes in the area.\n\n3. **External Obsolescence**: While not strictly functional, this refers to factors outside the property that can affect its value, such as changes in the neighborhood or market trends.\n\nAppraisers often face challenges in measuring the impact of functional obsolescence on a property's value, as it requires a nuanced understanding of market trends and individual preferences. Ultimately, recognizing and addressing functional obsolescence is crucial for property owners and investors to maintain or enhance the value of their real estate assets.
