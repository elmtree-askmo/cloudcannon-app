answer: >-
    The recent BRICS Foreign Ministers meeting took place on September 20, 2023, on the margins of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 78). The meeting was chaired by the Russian Federation, which is set to take over the BRICS chairmanship in 2024. \n\nDuring this meeting, the Ministers discussed several key topics, including:\n\n1. **Global and Regional Issues**: The Ministers exchanged views on major global and regional trends, emphasizing the importance of multilateralism and international cooperation.\n\n2. **Geopolitical Dynamics**: Discussions included the current geopolitical landscape, with a focus on the implications of ongoing conflicts and tensions, particularly in relation to the war in Ukraine.\n\n3. **Economic Cooperation**: The Ministers addressed the need for enhanced economic collaboration among BRICS nations, including trade and infrastructure development.\n\n4. **New Development Bank (NDB)**: There was a focus on boosting local currency fundraising and lending within the NDB, which aims to reduce the risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\n5. **BRICS Expansion**: Following the recent XV BRICS Summit held in August 2023, the Ministers reaffirmed the decision to invite six new countries—Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—to join BRICS as full members starting January 1, 2024.\n\nThese discussions reflect BRICS' commitment to strengthening its role as a voice for the Global South and addressing pressing global challenges through collaborative efforts.
