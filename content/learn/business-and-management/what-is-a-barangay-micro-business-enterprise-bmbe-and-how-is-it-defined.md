    What is a Barangay Micro Business Enterprise (BMBE) and how is it defined?
answer: >-
    A Barangay Micro Business Enterprise (BMBE) is defined under the Barangay Micro Business Enterprises Act of 2002 (Republic Act No. 9178) in the Philippines. According to the Act, a BMBE refers to any business entity or enterprise that is engaged in the production, processing, or manufacturing of products or commodities. This includes activities such as agro-processing, trading, and providing services. \n\nTo qualify as a BMBE, the total assets of the business must not exceed â‚±3 million, which includes assets arising from loans but excludes the value of the land on which the business operates. The primary purpose of a BMBE is to serve as a livelihood for its owners and to contribute to the local economy by generating employment and alleviating poverty.\n\nThe BMBE Act aims to promote and support the growth of these micro enterprises by providing them with various incentives and benefits, thereby integrating them into the mainstream economy.
