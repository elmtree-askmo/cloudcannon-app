    What are resolutions requiring special notice and when are they needed?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, certain resolutions require special notice as outlined in Section 115. A resolution requiring special notice is one that must be communicated to the company by members holding at least one percent of the total voting power or shares. This notice must be given at least 14 days before the meeting where the resolution is to be discussed.\n\nThe instances that typically require special notice include:\n\n1. **Appointment of Auditors**: A resolution at an annual general meeting (AGM) to appoint an auditor other than a retiring auditor, or to expressly state that a retiring auditor shall not be re-appointed, requires special notice. This is particularly relevant if the retiring auditor has completed a consecutive tenure of five years.\n\n2. **Other Matters Specified in the Articles**: Any other resolutions that are specified in the company's articles of association or by provisions in the Companies Act may also require special notice.\n\nIt is important to note that while resolutions requiring special notice are generally ordinary resolutions, they can also include special resolutions depending on the context. The requirement for special notice ensures that all members are adequately informed about significant decisions that may affect the company, allowing for greater transparency and governance.\n\nIn summary, special notice is a procedural requirement aimed at ensuring that members are aware of and can prepare for important resolutions that will be discussed at company meetings.
