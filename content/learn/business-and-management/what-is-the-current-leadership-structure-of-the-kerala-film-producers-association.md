    What is the current leadership structure of the Kerala Film Producers’ Association?
answer: >-
    The current leadership structure of the Kerala Film Producers' Association (KFPA) is as follows:\n\n- **President**: Anto Joseph\n- **Secretary**: B Rakesh\n- **Treasurer**: Listin Stephen\n- **Vice Presidents**: G Suresh Kumar, Siyad Kokker\n- **Joint Secretaries**: NP Subair, Sandeep Senan\n- **Executive Committee Members**: VBK Menon, MM Hamsa, Kireedam Unni, among others.\n\nThis leadership was established following the elections held during the annual general meeting at Abad Plaza, Ernakulam. The elections resulted in the panel led by Anto Joseph winning all but one seat, indicating a strong mandate for the new leadership. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the KFPA has faced criticism regarding its representation of women, with only about 15 to 18 women among a few hundred men in the association, which raises concerns about gender equity in leadership roles within the organization.
