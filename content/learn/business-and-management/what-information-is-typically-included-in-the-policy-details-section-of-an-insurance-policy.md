    The policy details section of an insurance policy typically includes the following key components:\n\n1. **Insured Name and Contact Information**: This includes the name of the policyholder and their contact details, which are essential for communication regarding the policy.\n\n2. **Policy Number**: A unique identifier assigned to the insurance policy, which is used for reference in all communications and claims.\n\n3. **Issuance Date**: The date on which the policy was issued, which is important for determining the start of coverage.\n\n4. **Insurance Period**: The duration for which the policy is valid, specifying the start and end dates of coverage.\n\n5. **Coverage Limits**: Details regarding the maximum amount the insurer will pay for covered losses, which can vary based on the type of coverage selected.\n\n6. **Deductibles**: The amount the policyholder must pay out of pocket before the insurance coverage kicks in for a claim.\n\n7. **Premium Amount**: The cost of the insurance policy, which is typically paid annually or semi-annually.\n\n8. **Vehicle Details**: For vehicle insurance, this includes specifics about the insured vehicle, such as make, model, year of manufacture, and registration number.\n\n9. **Insured Declared Value (IDV)**: The IDV represents the current market value of the vehicle, which is used to determine the compensation in case of total loss.\n\n10. **Terms and Conditions**: A summary of the obligations of both the insurer and the insured, including any specific requirements for maintaining coverage.\n\n11. **Exclusions**: A list of situations or conditions that are not covered by the policy, which is crucial for understanding the limitations of the coverage.\n\n12. **Liability Coverage**: Information regarding the extent of liability coverage provided under the policy, which protects against claims made by third parties.\n\n13. **No-Claim Bonus**: Details about any discounts or benefits that may be applicable if no claims are made during the policy period.\n\n14. **Contact Information for the Insurer**: Details on how to reach the insurance company for inquiries or claims.\n\nFor example, in the case of a comprehensive bike insurance policy for Bhupendra Prasad Bahuguna, the policy details would include his name, contact number, policy number (DBCR00278647914/00), issuance date (March 8, 2020), and the insurance period (March 11, 2020, to March 10, 2022), along with vehicle details and IDV information. \n\nThis comprehensive information ensures that both the insurer and the insured have a clear understanding of the coverage provided and the responsibilities involved.
