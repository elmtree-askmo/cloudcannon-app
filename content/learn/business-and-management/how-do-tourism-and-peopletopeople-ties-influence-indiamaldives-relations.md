    How do tourism and people-to-people ties influence India-Maldives relations?
answer: >-
    Tourism and people-to-people ties play a significant role in shaping India-Maldives relations, influencing both economic cooperation and diplomatic interactions between the two nations.\n\n1. **Tourism as an Economic Backbone**: The Maldives' economy heavily relies on tourism, which contributes approximately 20% to its GDP. Indian tourists have historically been a major source of visitors to the Maldives, accounting for a significant portion of total tourist arrivals. For instance, in 2023, Indian tourists represented about 11.2% of total arrivals, amounting to approximately 18.42 lakh visitors. This dominance underscores the importance of Indian tourism to the Maldivian economy.\n\n2. **Impact of Political Sentiment**: Recent political developments, such as the "India Out" campaign in the Maldives, have created tensions that have affected tourism dynamics. This campaign has sought to foster skepticism regarding India's investments and security partnerships in the Maldives, leading to a decline in Indian tourist arrivals. In January 2024, Indian tourists fell to the fifth position in arrivals, with countries like China and Russia surpassing India. This shift highlights how political sentiment can directly impact tourism and, consequently, economic relations.\n\n3. **People-to-People Ties**: The relationship between India and the Maldives is also strengthened through people-to-people connections facilitated by initiatives such as visa-free travel, improved air connectivity, and cultural exchange programs. These ties foster mutual understanding and cooperation, which are essential for maintaining a positive bilateral relationship. Leaders from both countries have emphasized the importance of these ties in discussions about enhancing bilateral relations.\n\n4. **Geopolitical Considerations**: The evolving geopolitical landscape, including China's growing influence in the region, adds complexity to India-Maldives relations. While tourism and people-to-people ties are crucial, they exist within a broader context of regional power dynamics. The Maldivian government's efforts to manage its tourism sector amid these geopolitical tensions reflect the delicate balance it must maintain between its relationships with India and other nations.\n\nIn summary, tourism and people-to-people ties are vital components of India-Maldives relations, contributing to economic resilience and fostering diplomatic goodwill. However, these ties are susceptible to the influences of political sentiment and regional geopolitics, which can significantly alter the dynamics of this bilateral relationship.
