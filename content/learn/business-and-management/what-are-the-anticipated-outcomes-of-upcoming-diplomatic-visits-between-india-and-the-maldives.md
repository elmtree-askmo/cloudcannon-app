    What are the anticipated outcomes of upcoming diplomatic visits between India and the Maldives?
answer: >-
    The anticipated outcomes of the upcoming diplomatic visits between India and the Maldives, particularly following President Mohamed Muizzu's recent state visit to India from October 6 to October 10, 2024, are expected to significantly shape the trajectory of bilateral relations between the two nations. This visit marks a pivotal moment as it is the first high-level engagement since President Muizzu took office in November 2023, and it aims to repair and strengthen the previously strained ties.\n\nKey anticipated outcomes include:\n\n1. **Strengthening Bilateral Relations**: The visit is expected to further cement the evolving partnership between India and the Maldives, moving towards a "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership." This reflects a mutual interest in enhancing cooperation across various sectors, including security, trade, and tourism.\n\n2. **Economic Agreements**: During the visit, several agreements were signed that are likely to bolster economic ties. Given that India was the largest source market for tourism to the Maldives in 2023, accounting for over 11% of total tourist arrivals, enhancing economic collaboration is a priority for both nations.\n\n3. **Repairing Diplomatic Relations**: President Muizzu's visit is seen as a visible effort to mend the diplomatic rift that had developed due to his earlier anti-India stance and derogatory remarks made by his ministers. The visit is anticipated to signal a shift towards a more cooperative and friendly diplomatic approach.\n\n4. **Security Cooperation**: The discussions are likely to include enhancing defense cooperation, which has historically been a cornerstone of India-Maldives relations. This includes joint military exercises and training opportunities for the Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF).\n\n5. **Cultural and Socio-Political Engagement**: As both countries approach the 60th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations in 2025, there is an emphasis on reaffirming cultural and socio-political ties, which have deep historical roots.\n\nOverall, the outcomes of these diplomatic engagements are expected to not only reset the relationship but also address broader regional security concerns, particularly in the context of increasing Chinese influence in the Maldives. The strategic importance of the Maldives in South Asia, especially in relation to India's foreign policy, will likely be a focal point of these discussions.
