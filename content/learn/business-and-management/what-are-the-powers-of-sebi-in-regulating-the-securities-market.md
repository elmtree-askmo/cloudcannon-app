answer: >-
    The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is endowed with extensive powers to regulate and oversee various aspects of the Indian securities market. Established in 1992, SEBI operates as an autonomous regulatory body with statutory powers granted by the SEBI Act of 1992. Its primary objectives include protecting investor interests, promoting the development of the securities market, and ensuring transparency and fairness in financial transactions.\n\nHere are some key powers of SEBI in regulating the securities market:\n\n1. **Regulatory Authority**: SEBI has the authority to formulate and enforce regulations governing stock exchanges, stockbrokers, mutual funds, portfolio managers, investment advisers, credit rating agencies, and other market intermediaries. This includes the power to approve or reject applications for registration and to impose conditions on their operations.\n\n2. **Quasi-Judicial Powers**: SEBI possesses quasi-judicial powers, allowing it to conduct investigations and pass judgments in cases of fraud and unethical practices within the securities market. This includes the ability to impose penalties and sanctions on violators.\n\n3. **Market Surveillance**: SEBI is responsible for monitoring trading activities to prevent market manipulation and ensure fair trading practices. It has the authority to conduct inquiries and investigations into suspicious activities.\n\n4. **Investor Protection**: One of SEBI's primary roles is to protect the interests of investors. It has the power to issue guidelines and regulations aimed at enhancing investor awareness and education, as well as to take action against entities that engage in fraudulent or unfair practices.\n\n5. **Regulation of Market Intermediaries**: SEBI regulates various market intermediaries, ensuring they adhere to prescribed standards and practices. This includes overseeing the functioning of stock exchanges and ensuring compliance with listing and delisting procedures.\n\n6. **Rule-Making Authority**: SEBI has the power to create rules and regulations under various acts, including the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA), which governs the listing and trading of securities.\n\n7. **Enforcement Powers**: SEBI can impose penalties for non-compliance with its regulations, including fines, suspension, or cancellation of registration of market participants.\n\n8. **Promoting Market Development**: SEBI is tasked with promoting the development of the securities market, which includes introducing new financial products and enhancing market infrastructure.\n\nOverall, SEBI plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the Indian financial system, fostering investor confidence, and ensuring a stable and transparent securities market.
