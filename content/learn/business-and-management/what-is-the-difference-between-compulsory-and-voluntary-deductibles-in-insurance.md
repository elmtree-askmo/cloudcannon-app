    What is the difference between compulsory and voluntary deductibles in insurance?
answer: >-
    In insurance, deductibles are the amounts that the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance coverage begins to pay for a claim. There are two main types of deductibles: compulsory and voluntary.\n\n1. **Compulsory Deductibles**: \n   - These are mandatory amounts that the insured must pay in the event of a claim. The insurer specifies this amount in the policy, and it cannot be waived or altered by the insured. For example, in the gathered information, a compulsory deductible of ₹100 is mentioned, which means that the insured must pay this amount before the insurance coverage applies to the claim.\n\n2. **Voluntary Deductibles**: \n   - These are optional amounts that the insured can choose to pay in addition to the compulsory deductible. By opting for a higher voluntary deductible, the insured may benefit from lower premium costs. In the gathered information, a voluntary deductible of ₹0 is indicated, meaning that the insured has not chosen to take on any additional deductible beyond the compulsory amount.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the nature of the deductibles: compulsory deductibles are required by the insurer and must be paid for every claim, while voluntary deductibles are chosen by the insured and can be adjusted to influence the premium amount.
