    What restrictions are placed on the licenses granted to Managed Service Providers?
answer: >-
    The licenses granted to Managed Service Providers (MSPs) come with several restrictions to ensure compliance and proper usage. Here are the key restrictions typically placed on these licenses:\n\n1. **Purpose of Use**: The license is granted specifically for the purpose of providing Managed Services to designated Tenants. The software may only be used for the internal business purposes of the Tenant and cannot be utilized for the benefit of any third party other than the Tenant originally specified in the relevant order.\n\n2. **Non-Transferability**: The licenses are generally non-transferable, meaning that MSPs cannot assign or transfer their rights to use the software to another entity without explicit permission.\n\n3. **Prohibition on Commercialization**: MSPs are typically prohibited from copying, sublicensing, renting, leasing, or otherwise commercializing the software or services. This includes restrictions against reselling or bartering the software.\n\n4. **Access Limitations**: MSPs are not allowed to enable access to the software for third parties, nor can they create external derivative works based on the software. This restriction is in place to protect the intellectual property of the software provider.\n\n5. **Prohibited Activities**: The licenses often include clauses that prohibit MSPs from engaging in activities such as reverse engineering, decompiling, or attempting to obtain the source code of the software. Additionally, using the software for fraudulent or illegal activities is strictly forbidden.\n\n6. **Compliance with Terms**: MSPs must adhere to all terms and conditions outlined in the licensing agreement, including payment of applicable fees and compliance with any additional restrictions specified in the agreement.\n\nThese restrictions are designed to protect the intellectual property rights of the software providers and ensure that the software is used in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the licensing agreement.
