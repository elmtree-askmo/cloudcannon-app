    What is the meaning and purpose of a substantial acquisition?
answer: >-
    A substantial acquisition refers to the acquisition of a significant percentage of shares or voting rights in a company, which typically triggers regulatory requirements under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations. Specifically, according to the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, a substantial acquisition occurs when an entity acquires 25% or more of the voting rights in a listed company. This threshold is critical as it necessitates compliance with various regulatory provisions aimed at ensuring transparency and protecting the interests of minority shareholders.\n\nThe purpose of regulating substantial acquisitions is to provide an orderly framework for takeovers and to prevent hostile takeovers that could undermine corporate governance. The regulations require that any substantial acquisition be accompanied by an open offer to the existing shareholders, allowing them the opportunity to sell their shares at a specified price. This mechanism is designed to ensure that minority shareholders are treated fairly and have a chance to exit if they do not wish to remain invested in the company under new control.\n\nIn summary, substantial acquisitions are significant from both a regulatory and corporate governance perspective, as they can lead to changes in control and influence over a company, thereby impacting its operations and strategic direction.
