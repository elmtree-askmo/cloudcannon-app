    What is physical deterioration in property?
answer: >-
    Physical deterioration in real estate refers to the gradual decline or loss of value of a property due to its physical condition deteriorating over time. This decline can result from various factors, including age, neglect, and environmental conditions that affect the building's structural integrity and aesthetics. \n\nPhysical deterioration is one of three main forms of depreciation in real estate, alongside functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. Unlike obsolescence, which may involve external factors or changes in market demand, physical deterioration is specifically related to the physical wear and tear of the property itself. \n\nThere are two primary categories of physical deterioration:\n\n1. **Curable Deterioration**: This type of deterioration can be economically repaired or improved. For example, issues like a leaky roof or faulty plumbing can be fixed, restoring the property's value.\n\n2. **Incurable Deterioration**: This type refers to deterioration that cannot be economically repaired. In such cases, the cost of repairs exceeds the value that those repairs would add to the property. \n\nExamples of physical deterioration include visible signs such as broken windows, cracks in concrete, and worn-out heating and cooling systems. The presence of physical deterioration can significantly impact a property's desirability and market value, as potential buyers may be deterred by the need for extensive repairs, and lenders may hesitate to finance such properties.\n\nUnderstanding physical deterioration is crucial for evaluating real estate assets, as it plays a key role in property valuation and asset management.
