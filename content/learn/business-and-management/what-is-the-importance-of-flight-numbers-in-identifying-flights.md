    What is the importance of flight numbers in identifying flights?
answer: >-
    Flight numbers play a crucial role in the airline industry as unique identifiers assigned to individual flights by airlines. They typically consist of a two-letter airline code followed by a series of numbers, such as 'AC123' for Air Canada. The importance of flight numbers can be summarized in several key points:\n\n1. **Tracking Flights**: Flight numbers are essential for tracking the status of flights in real-time. Passengers and airline staff can use these numbers to check for delays, cancellations, or gate changes.\n\n2. **Making Reservations**: When booking a flight, passengers need to provide the flight number to ensure they are reserving the correct flight. This helps avoid confusion, especially when multiple flights operate on similar routes.\n\n3. **Providing Information**: Flight numbers are used in various communication channels, including airport displays, boarding passes, and travel itineraries. They help passengers identify their specific flights easily.\n\n4. **Facilitating Code Sharing**: In the context of code sharing agreements between airlines, flight numbers allow passengers to book flights operated by different airlines under a single airline's code. This increases the number of available flights and destinations for travelers.\n\n5. **Navigating City Pair Availability (CPA)**: Flight numbers are integral to understanding city pair availability, as they are displayed alongside airline codes and class of service information. This helps passengers make informed decisions about their travel options.\n\nIn summary, flight numbers are vital for the efficient operation of airlines, enhancing the travel experience for passengers by providing clarity and ease of access to flight information.
