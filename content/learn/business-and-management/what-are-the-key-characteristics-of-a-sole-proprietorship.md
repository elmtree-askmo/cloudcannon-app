    What are the key characteristics of a sole proprietorship?
answer: >-
    A sole proprietorship is a simple and common form of business organization characterized by the following key features:\n\n1. **Individual Ownership**: A sole proprietorship is owned and operated by a single individual. This person has complete control over all aspects of the business, including decision-making, management, and operations.\n\n2. **Unlimited Liability**: The owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business. This means that if the business incurs debt or faces legal issues, the owner's personal assets can be at risk.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Ease of Setup**: Establishing a sole proprietorship is straightforward and involves minimal legal formalities compared to other business structures. There are typically fewer regulatory requirements, making it an attractive option for many entrepreneurs.\n\n4. **Direct Access to Profits**: The owner retains all profits generated by the business, as there are no partners or shareholders to share the earnings with.\n\n5. **Single Control**: The sole proprietor has full authority over the business operations, allowing for quick decision-making without the need for consensus from partners or a board of directors.\n\n6. **Taxation**: A sole proprietorship is not taxed as a separate entity. Instead, the income generated is reported on the owner's personal tax return, simplifying the tax process. The owner may be subject to self-employment taxes in addition to income taxes.\n\n7. **Legal Title**: The owner holds the legal title to all assets and properties of the business, which means that there is no distinction between personal and business assets.\n\nThese characteristics make sole proprietorships a popular choice for small business owners and entrepreneurs, although they also come with significant risks, particularly regarding liability.
