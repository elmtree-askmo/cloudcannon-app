    How does SEBI regulate the registration of intermediaries?
answer: >-
    The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates the registration of intermediaries through a structured framework established by the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, which consolidates various laws governing market intermediaries in India. This regulatory framework encompasses a wide range of entities, including stockbrokers, sub-brokers, portfolio managers, investment advisers, and other participants involved in the securities market.\n\n### Registration Process\n\nThe registration process for intermediaries is primarily conducted online through the SEBI Intermediary Portal (SI Portal). The steps involved in the registration process are as follows:\n\n1. **Access the SEBI Intermediary Portal**: The applicant must first pay an initial registration fee of ₹5,000 to gain access to the portal.\n   \n2. **Complete the Registration Form**: The applicant fills out the relevant registration form (RIA registration form) on the portal and uploads necessary documents.\n\n3. **Pay the Registration Fee**: After completing the form, the applicant must pay a registration fee of ₹10,000.\n\n### Requirements for Registration\n\nTo be eligible for registration, applicants must meet specific criteria, including:\n\n- Having at least two Key Management Personnel (KMPs) with relevant experience in the securities market.\n- Maintaining proper infrastructure, including storage space for documents and a separate access server room if the entity has other SEBI-registered businesses.\n\n### Obligations and Compliance\n\nOnce registered, intermediaries are required to adhere to various obligations, including:\n\n- Maintaining records of investor grievances and resolving them within 45 days.\n- Following a code of conduct and best corporate governance practices as outlined in the regulations.\n- Complying with any additional obligations that SEBI may issue through circulars from time to time.\n\n### Disciplinary Actions\n\nSEBI has the authority to take disciplinary actions against intermediaries for non-compliance, which may include suspension or cancellation of their registration.\n\nIn summary, SEBI's regulation of the registration of intermediaries is a comprehensive process designed to ensure that all market participants operate within a framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and investor protection.
