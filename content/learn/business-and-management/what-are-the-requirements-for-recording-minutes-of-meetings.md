    What are the requirements for recording minutes of meetings?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, the requirements for recording minutes of meetings are outlined primarily in Section 118. Here are the key points regarding the maintenance of minutes:\n\n1. **Mandatory Maintenance**: It is mandatory for every company to maintain minutes of all board meetings, committee meetings, and general meetings. This includes meetings of any class of creditors.\n\n2. **Minutes Book**: The minutes must be recorded in a designated minutes book. This book serves as the official record of the proceedings of the meetings.\n\n3. **Signing of Minutes**: The minutes must be signed by the chairman of the meeting or, in the absence of the chairman, by the chairman of the next meeting. This signature serves to authenticate the minutes.\n\n4. **Content of Minutes**: The minutes should accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions made during the meeting. They serve as a written record of significant discussions and resolutions.\n\n5. **Video Conferencing**: In cases where meetings are held through video conferencing or other audio-visual means, the minutes should still be maintained in accordance with Section 118. Additionally, records of such meetings should be preserved for future reference.\n\n6. **Legal Compliance**: Maintaining accurate minutes is crucial for ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance with legal requirements. Failure to comply with these provisions can lead to penalties and legal consequences.\n\n7. **Timeliness**: It is advisable to prepare and finalize the minutes promptly after the meeting to ensure that the decisions made are accurately captured and to facilitate follow-up actions.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, companies can ensure that they maintain proper governance and compliance as mandated by the Companies Act, 2013.
