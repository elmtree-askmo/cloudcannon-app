answer: >-
    Common deceptive recruitment promises made to potential fishing boat workers often include:\n\n1. **High Wages**: Traffickers frequently lure workers with promises of lucrative salaries that are significantly higher than what they would typically earn in their home countries. However, once on board, these wages are often not paid or are drastically reduced.\n\n2. **Job Security**: Recruiters may assure candidates of stable employment and long-term job security, but many workers find themselves trapped in exploitative conditions with no way to leave or change employers.\n\n3. **Minimal Fees**: Some recruiters claim that there are low or no recruitment fees, but in reality, they often impose high fees that workers are forced to pay off through their wages, leading to debt bondage.\n\n4. **Good Working Conditions**: Promises of safe and humane working environments are often made, yet many workers experience harsh conditions, including physical and emotional abuse, poor living quarters, and inadequate food and water.\n\n5. **Legal Employment**: Recruiters may falsely assure workers that they will be employed legally and that their rights will be protected, while in reality, many are subjected to illegal practices and human trafficking.\n\n6. **Training and Support**: Some recruiters promise training and support to help workers succeed in their roles, but many workers find themselves unprepared and unsupported once they are on the fishing vessels.\n\nThese deceptive practices contribute to a cycle of exploitation and abuse within the fishing industry, particularly affecting vulnerable populations from regions such as Southeast Asia and Africa. The isolation of fishing activities, often lasting months or years at sea, further complicates the ability of workers to escape or report these abuses.
