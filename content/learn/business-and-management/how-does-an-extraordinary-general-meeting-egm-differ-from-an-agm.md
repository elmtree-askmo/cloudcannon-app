    How does an Extra-ordinary General Meeting (EGM) differ from an AGM?
answer: >-
    An Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) and an Annual General Meeting (AGM) serve distinct purposes within the framework of corporate governance as outlined in the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n1. **Definition and Purpose**:\n   - **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**: This is a mandatory meeting that every company, except for One Person Companies (OPCs), must hold once a year. The AGM is primarily focused on discussing the company's annual financial statements, appointing directors, declaring dividends, and addressing other significant business matters. The first AGM must be held within nine months from the end of the first financial year, and subsequent AGMs must be held within six months from the end of the financial year.\n   - **Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)**: In contrast, an EGM is any meeting that is not an AGM. It is convened to address urgent or special matters that arise between scheduled AGMs. This could include issues that require immediate shareholder approval, such as changes in company structure, mergers, or other significant decisions that cannot wait until the next AGM.\n\n2. **Frequency and Scheduling**:\n   - **AGM**: AGMs are scheduled events that occur annually, as mandated by law.\n   - **EGM**: EGMs are ad-hoc meetings called as needed, typically in response to urgent issues that require the attention of shareholders.\n\n3. **Legal Framework**:\n   - Both AGMs and EGMs are governed by the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. However, the specific sections that apply differ. For instance, AGMs are covered under Section 96, while EGMs are addressed under Section 100 of the Act.\n\n4. **Notification and Documentation**:\n   - For AGMs, companies must provide a notice to shareholders detailing the date, time, and agenda of the meeting. Similarly, EGMs also require notice, but the process may be expedited due to the urgent nature of the matters being discussed.\n\n5. **Voting and Resolutions**:\n   - Both meetings allow shareholders to vote on resolutions, but the nature of the resolutions may differ. AGMs typically involve routine business, while EGMs may involve more critical decisions that require immediate shareholder input.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between an AGM and an EGM lies in their scheduling and purpose: AGMs are regular, annual meetings required by law, while EGMs are special meetings convened to address urgent matters that arise outside the regular annual schedule. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective corporate governance and compliance with the Companies Act, 2013.
