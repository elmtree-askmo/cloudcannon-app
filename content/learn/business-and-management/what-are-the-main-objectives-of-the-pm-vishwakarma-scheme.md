answer: >-
    The PM Vishwakarma Scheme, launched on September 17, 2023, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to provide comprehensive support to traditional artisans and craftspeople across India. The main objectives of the scheme include:\n\n1. **Recognition of Artisans**: The scheme seeks to formally recognize artisans and craftspeople as 'Vishwakarma', enabling them to avail various benefits under the program. This includes the issuance of a PM Vishwakarma certificate and an identity card.\n\n2. **Skill Upgradation**: The scheme offers training programs to enhance the skills of artisans. This includes basic training lasting 5-7 days and advanced training of 15 days or more, with a stipend of Rs. 500 per day during the training period.\n\n3. **Financial Support**: Enrolled artisans will have access to collateral-free credit support, with the first tranche offering up to Rs. 1 lakh and the second tranche up to Rs. 2 lakh, both at a concessional interest rate of 5%. This financial assistance is aimed at helping artisans scale up their businesses.\n\n4. **Empowerment and Economic Contribution**: The scheme is designed to empower artisans, encouraging them to enter the formal economy as entrepreneurs. It aims to promote the economic development of individuals skilled in traditional craftsmanship, thereby contributing to the larger goal of nation-building.\n\n5. **Support for Women and Marginalized Groups**: The PM Vishwakarma Scheme also emphasizes the empowerment of women and marginalized groups within the artisan community, ensuring inclusivity in its benefits.\n\nOverall, the PM Vishwakarma Scheme is a holistic initiative aimed at uplifting traditional artisans and craftspeople, enhancing their skills, providing financial support, and recognizing their contributions to the economy.
