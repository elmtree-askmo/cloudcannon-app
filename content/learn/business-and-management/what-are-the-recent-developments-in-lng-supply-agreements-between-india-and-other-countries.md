    What are the recent developments in LNG supply agreements between India and other countries?
answer: >-
    Recent developments in LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) supply agreements between India and other countries have been significant, particularly involving the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Indian companies.\n\n1. **ADNOC Gas Agreements**: In July 2023, ADNOC Gas signed a notable 14-year supply agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) to export up to 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of LNG to India. This agreement is part of a broader strategy to enhance energy cooperation between the UAE and India.\n\n2. **GAIL India Limited**: ADNOC Gas also entered into a 10-year agreement to supply 0.5 million metric tonnes per year of LNG to GAIL (India) Limited. This deal is part of a series of agreements that ADNOC has signed, which collectively are valued between $9.4 billion and $12 billion.\n\n3. **Strategic Partnerships**: The agreements between India and the UAE are aimed at strengthening their strategic partnership, particularly in the energy sector. This includes not only LNG supply but also cooperation in crude oil storage and civil nuclear energy.\n\n4. **Other International Deals**: In addition to the agreements with ADNOC, GAIL India has been active in negotiating new long-term LNG deals to meet rising domestic demand. For instance, GAIL announced a deal with Vitol for 1 million metric tonnes per year starting in 2026 for a duration of 10 years. Furthermore, IOC has signed a contract with TotalEnergies for 800,000 metric tonnes per year over a similar timeframe.\n\n5. **Market Trends**: India's LNG imports have shown an upward trend, with imports rising to 2.02 million metric tonnes in April 2023, reflecting a growing demand for natural gas in the country. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also projected a 4% year-on-year increase in India's natural gas consumption for 2023.\n\nThese developments indicate a robust and expanding LNG market in India, driven by strategic international partnerships and increasing domestic demand for cleaner energy sources.
