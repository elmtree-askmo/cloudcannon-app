    How is the Border Roads Organisation being supported in the latest budget?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has received significant support with a budgetary allocation of Rs 6,500 crore. This represents a 30% increase from the previous fiscal year's allocation, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing strategic infrastructure along the borders, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\n\nThe increased funding aims to bolster the development of critical infrastructure in border areas, which is essential for both national security and socio-economic growth. The allocation is part of a broader defense budget that emphasizes the importance of maintaining and improving border infrastructure. The government has highlighted that this funding will not only aid in strategic development but also contribute to the socio-economic progress of regions, including the North East.\n\nIn addition to the financial support, the BRO is currently engaged in multiple projects, including the construction of roads and bridges, which are vital for improving connectivity and accessibility in these remote areas. The focus on infrastructure development is expected to enhance the overall resilience and capability of the border regions.\n\nOverall, the Union Budget 2024-25 reflects a strong commitment to strengthening India's border infrastructure through substantial financial support for the Border Roads Organisation.
