    What are the new Geographical Indication Tags in India?
answer: >-
    As of January 7, 2023, India has over 500 registered Geographical Indication (GI) tags, which serve to protect products that originate from specific geographical regions and possess unique qualities or characteristics attributable to that origin. The GI tags are governed by the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999.\n\nRecent updates regarding GI tags include the proposed amendments to the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Rules, 2023, which aim to simplify the registration process and enhance the protection of unique regional products. These amendments reflect the Indian government's commitment to safeguarding the integrity and heritage of geographical indications.\n\nSome notable GI tags in India include:\n\n- **Darjeeling Tea** (West Bengal) - Agricultural Goods\n- **Allahabadi Surkha Guava** (Uttar Pradesh) - Agricultural Goods\n- **Kanchipuram Sarees** (Tamil Nadu) - Handicrafts\n- **Madhubani Paintings** (Bihar) - Handicrafts\n- **Manipur Black Rice** - Agricultural Goods\n\nThese products not only highlight the cultural heritage of their respective regions but also contribute to rural development and enhance the marketability of Indian products in the global market.\n\nFor the most current and detailed list of GI tags, including any new additions in 2024, it is advisable to refer to official sources or databases that track GI registrations in India.
