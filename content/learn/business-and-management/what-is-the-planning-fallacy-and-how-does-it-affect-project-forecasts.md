    The planning fallacy is a cognitive bias that leads to underestimation of time and costs in project forecasts, resulting in overly optimistic timelines and budgets. It emphasizes the importance of integrating historical data and adopting an outside view to improve accuracy.

    What is the planning fallacy and how does it affect project forecasts?
answer: >-
    The planning fallacy is a cognitive bias that leads individuals and organizations to underestimate the time, costs, and risks associated with future actions while simultaneously overestimating the benefits. This phenomenon often results in overly optimistic project timelines and budgets. For instance, a team might plan a software development project believing it will take three months to complete, despite historical data indicating that similar projects typically require six months.\n\nThis bias can significantly affect project forecasts in several ways:\n\n1. **Underestimation of Time and Costs**: The planning fallacy causes planners to focus on best-case scenarios, neglecting potential obstacles and challenges. This can lead to unrealistic timelines and budgets that do not account for unforeseen delays or expenses.\n\n2. **Overconfidence in Outcomes**: Decision-makers may exhibit an optimistic bias, believing that their project will succeed without considering the statistical likelihood of failure based on similar past projects. This overconfidence can result in inadequate risk management and contingency planning.\n\n3. **Neglect of Historical Data**: As noted by planning expert Bent Flyvbjerg, a major source of error in forecasting is the tendency to underweight or ignore distributional information from past projects. Planners should strive to incorporate historical data to improve the accuracy of their forecasts.\n\n4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: The planning fallacy can lead to situations where decision-makers continue to invest in failing projects due to the resources already committed, rather than evaluating the project's future potential objectively. This is often referred to as the sunk-cost fallacy.\n\n5. **Real-World Examples**: Numerous instances illustrate the planning fallacy, such as the Scottish Parliament building project, which initially estimated costs at £40 million but ultimately ballooned to £241 million. Such examples highlight the pervasive nature of this bias across various sectors.\n\nTo mitigate the planning fallacy, it is essential for planners to adopt an "outside view," which involves looking at similar past projects to inform their estimates. By doing so, they can better account for the distribution of outcomes and improve the accuracy of their forecasts.
