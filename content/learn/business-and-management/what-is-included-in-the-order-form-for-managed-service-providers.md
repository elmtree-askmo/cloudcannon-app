It may also include details about the software or systems involved.\n\n2. **Licensing Information**: The Order Form often includes information about the licensing of any software that the MSP will provide. This may specify whether the customer is opting for standard or premium service levels.\n\n3. **Pricing and Payment Terms**: The Order Form outlines the pricing structure for the services, including any one-time fees, recurring charges, and payment terms. This section is crucial for establishing the financial obligations of both parties.\n\n4. **Term of Service**: This includes the duration of the agreement, any automatic renewal clauses, and conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.\n\n5. **Obligations of the Parties**: The Order Form may detail the responsibilities of both the MSP and the customer, including service level expectations, maintenance duties, and security obligations.\n\n6. **General Terms and Conditions**: This section incorporates the universal terms that govern the agreement, including limitations of liability, warranties, and dispute resolution processes.\n\n7. **Exhibits and Attachments**: Any additional documents or appendices that provide further details about the services, such as service level agreements (SLAs) or technical specifications, may also be referenced in the Order Form.\n\nThese elements ensure that both the MSP and the customer have a clear understanding of the services being provided, the expectations involved, and the financial arrangements.
