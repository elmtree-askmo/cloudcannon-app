    How does E-Commerce differ from E-Business?
answer: >-
    E-Commerce and E-Business are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different concepts within the realm of online business activities.\n\n**E-Commerce** primarily focuses on the online trading of goods, services, or information. It involves commercial transactions conducted over the internet, such as buying and selling products, making payments, and managing online orders. Essentially, e-commerce is a subset of e-business that deals specifically with the transactional aspect of business.\n\nOn the other hand, **E-Business** encompasses a broader spectrum of business activities conducted electronically. This includes not only the buying and selling of goods and services but also other business operations such as internal processes, communication, collaboration, and customer relationship management. E-business refers to all types of business activities that utilize technology and the internet, making it a super-set of e-commerce.\n\nTo summarize the key differences:\n- **E-Commerce**: \n  - Focuses on online commercial transactions.\n  - Involves activities like buying, selling, and monetary transactions.\n  - Considered a narrow concept and a subset of e-business.\n\n- **E-Business**: \n  - Encompasses all business activities conducted over the internet.\n  - Includes not only transactions but also information sharing, communication, and internal processes.\n  - Represents a broader concept that includes e-commerce as one of its components.\n\nIn essence, while e-commerce is concerned with the transactional side of business, e-business covers the entire spectrum of business operations that can be conducted electronically.
