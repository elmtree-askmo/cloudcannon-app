    How does internet banking differ from electronic banking in terms of service types?
answer: >-
    Internet banking and electronic banking (E-banking) are often confused, but they represent different scopes of banking services. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two in terms of service types:\n\n### Definitions\n- **Internet Banking**: Also known as online banking or net banking, internet banking is a specific type of electronic banking that allows customers to conduct financial and non-financial transactions via the internet. This includes services such as funds transfers, bill payments, and account balance inquiries.\n\n- **Electronic Banking (E-banking)**: This is a broader category that encompasses all forms of banking services conducted through electronic means. E-banking includes internet banking, but also extends to other services such as mobile banking, automated teller machines (ATMs), electronic funds transfer (EFT), electronic clearing services (ECS), and telebanking.\n\n### Service Types\n1. **Internet Banking Services**:\n   - Funds transfer (within the same bank or to other banks)\n   - Bill payments (utilities, credit cards, etc.)\n   - Account balance checks\n   - Opening or closing fixed deposit accounts\n   - Buying and selling shares or bonds\n   - Online ticket booking\n   - Issuing cheque books\n   - Setting up auto payments\n\n2. **Electronic Banking Services**:\n   - **Internet Banking**: As described above.\n   - **Mobile Banking**: Accessing banking services via mobile apps, which offer similar functionalities to internet banking but are optimized for mobile devices.\n   - **Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)**: Allowing cash withdrawals, deposits, and other transactions without the need for a bank teller.\n   - **Smart Cards**: Cards that can be used for transactions and may include features like contactless payments.\n   - **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)**: A system for transferring money electronically between bank accounts.\n   - **Electronic Clearing Services (ECS)**: Used for bulk transactions like payroll processing and recurring payments.\n   - **Telebanking**: Accessing banking services via telephone, allowing users to perform transactions without visiting a branch.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, internet banking is a subset of electronic banking focused specifically on online transactions through the internet. In contrast, electronic banking encompasses a wider range of services, including internet banking, mobile banking, ATMs, and other electronic transaction methods. This distinction highlights the various ways customers can access banking services in the digital age.
