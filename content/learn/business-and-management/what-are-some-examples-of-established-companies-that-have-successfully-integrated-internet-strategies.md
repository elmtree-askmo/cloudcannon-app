    Several established companies have successfully integrated internet strategies into their business models, demonstrating the transformative power of digital technologies. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **IKEA**: IKEA has embraced digital transformation by integrating e-commerce with its traditional retail model.

This shift involved the development of proprietary software and tools that empower agents and enhance customer interactions, showcasing how traditional industries can pivot towards technology-driven solutions.\n\n6. **Under Armour**: Under Armour introduced the "Connected Fitness" concept, which allows users to track and analyze their fitness data through a mobile platform. This initiative not only enhances customer engagement but also positions the brand as a leader in the intersection of fitness and technology.\n\n7. **Amazon**: Amazon's transition from a book retailer to a global e-commerce giant exemplifies successful internet strategy integration. The company has continuously innovated its business model, expanding into various sectors, including cloud computing (AWS), streaming services, and grocery delivery, all while leveraging data analytics to enhance customer experiences.\n\nThese examples illustrate how established companies can successfully integrate internet strategies to enhance their operations, improve customer engagement, and adapt to the evolving digital landscape. Each of these companies has demonstrated a commitment to innovation and a willingness to embrace change, which are critical factors for success in today's business environment.
