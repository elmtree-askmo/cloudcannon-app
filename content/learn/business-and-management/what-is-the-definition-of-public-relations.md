    What is the definition of public relations?
answer: >-
    Public relations (PR) can be defined as a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics. According to the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), PR is fundamentally about managing the spread of information between an organization and the public, which includes various stakeholders such as the media, investors, employees, and the general public.\n\nAt its core, public relations involves influencing, engaging, and establishing relationships with key stakeholders to shape and frame public perception. This practice is essential for organizations to maintain a positive image and reputation, as it focuses on fostering understanding and goodwill between the organization and its audience.\n\nIn summary, public relations is not just about disseminating information; it is a comprehensive approach to managing communication and relationships that ultimately contributes to the organization's success and public perception.
