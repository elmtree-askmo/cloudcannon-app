    What is predatory pricing and how is it identified?
answer: >-
    Predatory pricing is an illegal business practice where a dominant firm sets prices for its products or services at unrealistically low levels, often below the cost of production, with the intention of eliminating competition. This strategy is typically employed by companies with substantial market power and financial resources, allowing them to sustain losses over an extended period while driving competitors out of the market. Once the competition is weakened or eliminated, the predatory firm can then raise prices to recoup its initial losses and establish a monopoly.\n\nIdentifying predatory pricing involves several key indicators:\n\n1. **Pricing Below Cost**: The firm consistently sells products at prices lower than its costs, which is a primary sign of predatory pricing. This can be assessed by comparing the firm's prices to its average variable costs (AVC).\n\n2. **Intent to Eliminate Competition**: There must be evidence that the pricing strategy is aimed at driving competitors out of the market. This can be inferred from the firm's market behavior and communications.\n\n3. **Market Impact**: The pricing practices should have a substantial likelihood of harming competition in the market as a whole, not just affecting individual rivals. This is a requirement established by the U.S. Supreme Court, which mandates that plaintiffs demonstrate how the pricing strategy impacts overall market competition.\n\n4. **Sustainability of Low Prices**: Predatory pricing is not a short-term tactic; it requires the firm to maintain low prices long enough to weaken or eliminate competition. This necessitates significant financial resources to absorb losses over time.\n\n5. **Recoupment Potential**: While not a precondition for establishing predatory pricing under certain legal frameworks, the ability of the firm to recoup its losses after eliminating competition can be a factor in assessing the legality of the pricing strategy.\n\nIn summary, predatory pricing is characterized by low pricing intended to eliminate competition, and its identification requires a comprehensive analysis of pricing strategies, market behavior, and the broader competitive landscape. Legal recourse is available for businesses that believe they are victims of such practices, allowing them to file complaints with relevant authorities.
