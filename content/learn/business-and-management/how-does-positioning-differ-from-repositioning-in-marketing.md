    How does positioning differ from repositioning in marketing?
answer: >-
    Positioning and repositioning are two distinct concepts in marketing that relate to how a brand or product is perceived in the marketplace.\n\n**Positioning** refers to the process of establishing a brand or product's identity and image in the minds of consumers relative to competitors. It involves creating a distinctive image and offering that stands out in the marketplace. Companies utilize various strategies to achieve effective positioning, such as identifying unique selling propositions and employing perceptual maps to visualize consumer perceptions. The goal of positioning is to communicate why consumers should choose a particular brand over others.\n\nOn the other hand, **repositioning** is the strategic process of changing the existing perception of a brand or product in the market. This may involve altering the target market, modifying the product, or adjusting marketing strategies to better align with current market trends and consumer preferences. Repositioning is often necessary when a brand needs to adapt to changes in the market, tap into new customer segments, or enhance its competitive edge. It requires thorough market research and a solid marketing strategy to effectively redefine the brand identity while maintaining its core values.\n\nIn summary, while positioning is about establishing a brand's initial identity in the market, repositioning is about changing that identity to better meet the evolving needs of consumers and the competitive landscape.
