    What is the current state of the poultry industry globally?
answer: >-
    The current state of the global poultry industry is characterized by significant growth and ongoing challenges. As of 2023, the poultry market is valued at approximately USD 325.41 billion and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.0%, reaching around USD 401.97 billion by 2032. The chicken sector, in particular, is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 5.45% from 2022 to 2028, driven by increased efficiency and industrialization in poultry production across various regions.\n\nDespite the positive growth trends, the industry faces several challenges, including food security, social issues such as poverty alleviation and equity, health concerns (both animal and human), and environmental impacts related to natural resources and climate change. Poultry plays a crucial role in global food security, contributing significantly to protein supply.\n\nIn terms of production, broiler production is forecasted to reach record levels in 2023, while turkey production is also expected to rebound. However, there are indications of a decline in total meat production, including poultry, for the first time since 2014, primarily due to a decrease in beef production. Egg production has seen a slight decline, with a total of 110 billion eggs produced in 2023, down from the previous year.\n\nThe industry is also influenced by external factors such as outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which can impact production and prices. Major players in the poultry market include companies like JBS S.A, Tyson Foods, and Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, among others, which dominate the market across various regions.\n\nOverall, while the poultry industry is experiencing growth and adapting to changing market dynamics, it must navigate a complex landscape of challenges to sustain its contributions to global food systems.
