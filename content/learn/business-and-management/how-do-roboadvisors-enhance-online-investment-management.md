This capability allows them to respond quickly to market changes and provide clients with timely insights.\n\n6. **Risk Management**: Robo-advisors often include built-in risk assessment tools that help clients understand their risk tolerance and adjust their portfolios accordingly. This proactive approach to risk management can help protect clients' investments from market volatility.\n\n7. **Continuous Monitoring and Rebalancing**: Robo-advisors continuously monitor investment portfolios and automatically rebalance them as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation. This ensures that clients' investments remain aligned with their financial goals over time.\n\n8. **Educational Resources**: Many robo-advisory platforms provide educational materials and resources to help clients understand investment concepts and strategies.
