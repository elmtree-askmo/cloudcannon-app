answer: >-
    In recent developments, India and the Maldives have signed several significant Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) aimed at strengthening bilateral relations. On July 13, 2023, a ceremony held in New Delhi saw the exchange of nine key agreements across various fields, presided over by the Foreign Ministers of both countries. This event marked a notable step in enhancing cooperation between India and the Maldives, particularly following the change in the Maldivian government.\n\nAmong the agreements signed, two MoUs were particularly highlighted during the visit of India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, which was the first by an Indian minister since the new Maldivian government took office in November 2023. These agreements are part of a broader effort to reset and improve the historically complex relationship between the two nations.\n\nAdditionally, the MoUs cover a range of areas including training of judicial officers, law enforcement training, and cooperation in sports and youth affairs. A significant aspect of the agreements is the commitment to launch negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement, which aims to bolster economic ties further.\n\nThe context of these agreements is also important, as India has been a major source of tourism for the Maldives, accounting for over 11% of the 1.8 million tourist arrivals in 2023. This economic interdependence is complemented by India's role as the second-largest trade partner for the Maldives, with bilateral trade exceeding USD 300 million.\n\nOverall, these recent MoUs reflect a strategic move to enhance collaboration and address mutual interests, particularly in light of the changing political landscape in the Maldives.
