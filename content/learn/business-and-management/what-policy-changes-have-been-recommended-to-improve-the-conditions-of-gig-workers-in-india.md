    What policy changes have been recommended to improve the conditions of gig workers in India?
answer: >-
    To improve the conditions of gig workers in India, several policy changes have been recommended, reflecting the growing recognition of their rights and the need for social security. Here are some key recommendations and developments:\n\n1. **Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act, 2023**: This landmark legislation aims to provide social security benefits to gig workers. It proposes the establishment of a social security fund funded by a welfare tax of 1%-2% on transactions made through platforms like food delivery and ride-sharing apps. This law is seen as a significant step towards granting gig workers rights similar to those enjoyed by formal sector employees.\n\n2. **Code on Social Security, 2020**: This code marks a pivotal change by defining 'gig workers' and 'platform workers' for the first time in Indian law. It mandates the creation of social security measures for these workers, including life and disability cover, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection. It also includes provisions for the registration of unorganized workers, which encompasses gig workers.\n\n3. **Universal Minimum Wage**: The Code on Wages, 2019, aims to establish a universal minimum wage and floor wage applicable across both organized and unorganized sectors, including gig workers. This is crucial for ensuring that gig workers receive fair compensation for their labor.\n\n4. **Awareness and Skill Development Programs**: To enhance participation, especially among women and marginalized groups, there is a call for conducting awareness programs and outcome-oriented skill development initiatives. This would help create a more inclusive environment in the gig economy.\n\n5. **Infrastructure and Work Design Improvements**: Recommendations also include creating better infrastructure and work designs that facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities (Divyang) in the gig economy, thereby promoting inclusivity.\n\n6. **Role of Institutions**: The International Labour Organization emphasizes the need for greater involvement of Employer and Business Member Organizations (EBMOs) in shaping social dialogue and addressing the challenges faced by gig workers. This includes advocating for better working conditions and social protections.\n\nThese policy changes and recommendations reflect a growing acknowledgment of the importance of gig workers in India's economy, projected to employ 23.5 million workers by 2029-30, and the necessity of providing them with adequate protections and benefits.
