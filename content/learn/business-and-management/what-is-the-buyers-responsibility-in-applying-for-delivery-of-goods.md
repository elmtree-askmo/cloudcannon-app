    What is the buyer's responsibility in applying for delivery of goods?
answer: >-
    Under the Sale of Goods Act of 1930, the buyer has specific responsibilities when it comes to the delivery of goods. Here are the key points regarding the buyer's responsibilities in applying for delivery:\n\n1. **Acceptance of Delivery**: The buyer is obligated to accept the delivery of goods as per the terms of the contract. This means that the buyer must be ready to receive the goods when they are delivered by the seller.\n\n2. **Payment of Agreed Price**: One of the primary duties of the buyer is to pay the agreed price for the goods. This financial commitment is essential for the seller to receive due compensation for the goods provided.\n\n3. **Unloading of Goods**: After the goods are delivered, the buyer is responsible for unloading them at the designated location. This includes arranging for the necessary labor, equipment, and resources to safely unload the goods.\n\n4. **Handling Import Customs and Taxes**: In cases where goods are imported, the buyer must take responsibility for handling import customs formalities and tax payments. This responsibility can lead to additional costs and delays beyond the initial purchase price.\n\n5. **Timely Acceptance**: The buyer must accept the delivery in a timely manner. If the buyer neglects to take delivery or refuses to accept the goods, it may constitute a breach of contract.\n\n6. **Rights to Reject Non-Conforming Goods**: While the buyer has the responsibility to accept delivery, they also have the right to reject goods that do not conform to the contract specifications. This right ensures that the buyer receives goods that match the agreed terms.\n\nIn summary, the buyer's responsibilities in applying for delivery of goods include accepting the delivery, making payment, unloading the goods, handling customs and taxes, and ensuring timely acceptance while also having the right to reject non-conforming goods. These obligations are crucial for the successful performance of the sale of goods contract as outlined in the Sale of Goods Act.
