    What initiatives are being taken for energy audit and support for MSMEs?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, several initiatives have been introduced to support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the context of energy audits and energy efficiency improvements. Here are the key initiatives:\n\n1. **Energy Audit Facilitation**: The government plans to facilitate energy audits for MSMEs across 60 clusters. This initiative aims to assess energy consumption and identify opportunities for energy savings, thereby promoting energy efficiency within these enterprises.\n\n2. **Financial Support for Energy Transition**: Alongside the energy audits, financial support will be provided to help MSMEs transition to cleaner energy sources. This includes an investment-grade energy audit specifically designed for traditional micro and small enterprises in sectors such as brass and ceramics.\n\n3. **Walk-Through Energy Audits**: The budget outlines plans for conducting approximately 200 walk-through energy audits in MSME clusters during the fiscal year 2024-25. These audits will help identify immediate energy-saving opportunities and provide a pathway for further energy efficiency measures.\n\n4. **Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Initiatives**: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is actively involved in promoting energy efficiency in the MSME sector. This includes ongoing programs and collaborations aimed at enhancing energy efficiency measures and technologies within MSMEs.\n\n5. **Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing**: The initiatives also focus on strengthening MSMEs through capacity building, knowledge sharing, and demonstrations of efficient technologies. This approach is intended to empower MSMEs to adopt energy-efficient practices and technologies effectively.\n\nThese initiatives reflect a comprehensive strategy to enhance the energy efficiency of MSMEs, thereby contributing to their sustainability and competitiveness in the market.
