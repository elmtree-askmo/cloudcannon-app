    How do private entities benefit from additional compensation expenses related to senior citizens, PWDs, and solo parents?
answer: >-
    Private entities in the Philippines can benefit from additional compensation expenses related to senior citizens, persons with disabilities (PWDs), and solo parents through various tax incentives and deductions provided by the government. Here are the key benefits:\n\n1. **Tax Deductions for Hiring Senior Citizens**: Under the proposed amendments to the Expanded Senior Citizens Act, private entities that employ senior citizens can enjoy an increased allowable deduction from their gross income. This deduction is set to rise from 15% to 25% of the total cost of employing senior citizens. This incentivizes businesses to hire older workers, thereby reducing their taxable income and encouraging the inclusion of senior citizens in the workforce.\n\n2. **Tax Deductions for Hiring PWDs**: Similar to the incentives for senior citizens, private entities that employ PWDs are entitled to a tax deduction equivalent to 25% of the total salaries paid to these employees. This provision is outlined in Republic Act 7277, as amended by RA 10524, which aims to promote the employment of PWDs and recognizes their contributions to the workforce.\n\n3. **Support for Solo Parents**: The Expanded Solo Parents Welfare Act (Republic Act No. 11861) provides additional benefits and protections for solo parents, which can indirectly benefit private entities. By offering financial assistance, parental leave, and other support mechanisms, the law helps solo parents balance their work and family responsibilities. This can lead to increased employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately benefiting the employer.\n\n4. **Enhanced Employee Benefits Management**: Employers can utilize comprehensive HRIS solutions, such as those offered by SunFish Workplaze, to streamline payroll, leave management, and compliance with legal requirements related to the benefits for senior citizens, PWDs, and solo parents. This efficiency can reduce administrative burdens and enhance overall productivity.\n\nIn summary, private entities can leverage these laws to not only fulfill their social responsibility but also to gain financial advantages through tax deductions and improved employee morale, which can lead to a more stable and productive workforce.
