    What distinguishes an ordinary resolution from a special resolution?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, resolutions are essential tools for decision-making within a company, and they are categorized into two main types: ordinary resolutions and special resolutions. The key distinctions between these two types of resolutions are as follows:\n\n1. **Approval Threshold**:\n   - **Ordinary Resolution**: This type of resolution requires a simple majority for approval, which means more than 50% of the votes cast must be in favor. It is typically used for routine business decisions, such as appointing directors or approving financial statements.\n   - **Special Resolution**: In contrast, a special resolution requires a higher threshold for approval, usually at least 75% of the votes cast. This type of resolution is reserved for more significant decisions that may affect the company's structure or constitution, such as amendments to the articles of association or changes in the company's name.\n\n2. **Nature of Decisions**:\n   - **Ordinary Resolution**: These resolutions are used for everyday operational matters and do not significantly alter the company's governance or structure.\n   - **Special Resolution**: Special resolutions are used for critical decisions that have substantial implications for the company, such as mergers, acquisitions, or changes in share capital.\n\n3. **Voting Process**:\n   - Both types of resolutions can be passed during general meetings, and the voting can occur through a show of hands or electronically. However, the specific requirements for the number of votes needed to pass each type of resolution differ, as outlined above.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between ordinary and special resolutions lies in the required majority for approval and the significance of the decisions being made. Ordinary resolutions are for routine matters needing a simple majority, while special resolutions are for more critical decisions requiring a supermajority.
