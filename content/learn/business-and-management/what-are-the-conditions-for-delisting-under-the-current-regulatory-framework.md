    What are the conditions for delisting under the current regulatory framework?
answer: >-
    Under the current regulatory framework, specifically the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021, the conditions for delisting equity shares are as follows:\n\n1. **Applicability**: The regulations apply to the delisting of equity shares of a company, including those with superior voting rights, from all or any recognized stock exchanges where such shares are listed.\n\n2. **Approval Requirements**: A company must obtain approval from its shareholders through a special resolution. This requires a minimum of 75% of the votes cast in favor of the delisting proposal.\n\n3. **Exit Opportunity**: The company must provide an exit opportunity to the shareholders. This can be done through a reverse book building process or a fixed price mechanism, ensuring that shareholders have a chance to sell their shares at a fair price.\n\n4. **Compliance with Regulations**: The company must comply with all applicable regulations and guidelines set forth by SEBI, including any amendments that may be proposed or enacted.\n\n5. **No Pending Regulatory Actions**: The company should not be under any investigation or facing any regulatory actions that could impede the delisting process.\n\n6. **Financial Health**: In certain cases, particularly for Investment Holding Companies (IHCs), the company must meet specific financial criteria, such as having at least 75% of its fair value in direct investments in equity shares of other listed companies.\n\n7. **Market Conditions**: The shares must be frequently traded, and the delisting should not be detrimental to the interests of the public shareholders.\n\nThese conditions are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and ensure a transparent and fair delisting process. The regulatory framework is subject to amendments, as seen in the recent consultation papers issued by SEBI, which aim to simplify the delisting process and enhance investor protection.
