    What are the specific requirements for meetings in a One Person Company (OPC)?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, a One Person Company (OPC) has specific requirements regarding meetings, which are more relaxed compared to other types of companies. Here are the key points regarding meetings for an OPC:\n\n1. **Board Meetings**: An OPC is required to hold at least one Board of Directors meeting in each half of the calendar year. The gap between two such meetings must not be less than 90 days. This requirement is outlined in Section 173(5) of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n2. **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**: Unlike other companies, an OPC is exempt from holding an Annual General Meeting (AGM) as per Section 96 of the Companies Act, 2013. This exemption allows the sole member to manage the company without the need for formal meetings, which simplifies governance for single-member entities.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Although an AGM is not required, the OPC must maintain proper records of the Board meetings, including minutes and resolutions. This is essential for compliance and governance purposes.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Management**: The provisions allow the sole member of an OPC to make decisions without the need for extensive formalities, thus providing flexibility in managing the business.\n\n5. **Compliance Requirements**: Despite the relaxed requirements, an OPC must still comply with other statutory obligations, such as maintaining proper books of accounts and filing necessary returns.\n\nIn summary, while an OPC must hold at least one Board meeting per half of the year, it is not required to conduct an AGM, which significantly reduces the administrative burden on the sole member.
