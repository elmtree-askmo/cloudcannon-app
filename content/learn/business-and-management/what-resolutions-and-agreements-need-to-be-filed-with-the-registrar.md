    What resolutions and agreements need to be filed with the registrar?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, certain resolutions and agreements must be filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) as mandated by Section 117. The key requirements for filing include:\n\n1. **Types of Resolutions**: The Act specifies that a copy of every resolution or any agreement related to matters specified in sub-section (3) of Section 117 must be filed. This includes both ordinary and special resolutions. Ordinary resolutions require a simple majority, while special resolutions require at least a three-fourths majority.\n\n2. **Form MGT-14**: The primary form used for this purpose is Form MGT-14. This form is required to be filed for:\n   - Resolutions passed in general meetings.\n   - Certain agreements that are significant to the companyâ€™s operations.\n\n3. **Explanatory Statements**: Along with the resolution or agreement, an explanatory statement under Section 102 must be annexed if applicable. This statement provides additional context and details regarding the resolution being filed.\n\n4. **Filing Timeline**: The resolutions and agreements must be filed with the RoC within 30 days of passing the resolution.\n\n5. **Revised Form**: It is important to note that Form MGT-14 has been revised as per the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notification dated January 21, 2023, which may include updates to the filing process or requirements.\n\n6. **Legal Compliance**: Filing these resolutions is crucial for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as they serve as formal records of decisions made by the company.\n\nIn summary, companies must file resolutions and agreements using Form MGT-14, along with any necessary explanatory statements, to the Registrar of Companies within the stipulated timeframe to maintain compliance with the Companies Act, 2013.
