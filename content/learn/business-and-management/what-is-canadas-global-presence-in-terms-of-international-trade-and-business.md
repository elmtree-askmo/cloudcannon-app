    What is Canada's global presence in terms of international trade and business?
answer: >-
    Canada's global presence in terms of international trade and business is characterized by a robust framework of trade agreements, significant foreign direct investment (FDI), and a strategic approach to expanding its economic footprint internationally.\n\n### International Trade and Agreements\nCanada is an active participant in international trade, with a total trade in goods and services that reached approximately $1.3 trillion in value prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has established 15 active free trade agreements (FTAs) covering 51 countries, which facilitate preferential access to a global market with a combined GDP of approximately $52 trillion. This access represents about 61% of the world's output of goods and services and encompasses around 1.5 billion consumers. These agreements not only eliminate tariffs but also create opportunities for Canadian businesses to expand their operations internationally.\n\n### Foreign Direct Investment\nCanada is recognized as a premier destination for foreign direct investment, ranking second only to the United States in the Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index. The stock of FDI in Canada increased by $52.4 billion in 2023, with the United States being the largest investor, accounting for 45.7% of total FDI. This influx of investment is crucial for economic growth, job creation, and technology transfer, contributing significantly to Canada's economic prosperity.\n\n### Competitive Advantage\nCanadian businesses enjoy a competitive advantage in international markets, particularly in countries governed by FTAs. The likelihood of engaging in international trade increases with the size of the business, with larger enterprises more likely to participate in exporting and importing activities. However, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often rely on brokerage services to navigate the complexities of international trade.\n\n### Economic Context\nDespite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, which saw a 13% decline in trade in 2020, Canada has shown resilience and adaptability. The countryâ€™s economic health is supported by a strong regulatory framework under the Investment Canada Act, which aims to attract foreign investment while ensuring responsible business conduct.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Canadaâ€™s global presence in international trade and business is marked by its strategic trade agreements, significant foreign investment, and a competitive edge in various markets. As Canada continues to strengthen its economic ties globally, it remains a vital player in the international business landscape.
