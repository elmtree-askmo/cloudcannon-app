    The weighted moving average (WMA) is a forecasting technique that assigns different weights to past observations, allowing more recent data to have a greater influence on the forecast than older data. This method is particularly useful in demand forecasting, where trends can change over time.\n\n### Example of Using Weighted Moving Average in Demand Forecasting\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical scenario where a company wants to forecast the demand for a product over the next month based on the past three months of sales data. The sales data for the last three months is as follows:\n\n- Month 1: 100 units\n- Month 2: 150 units\n- Month 3: 200 units\n\nIn this example, we will assign the following weights to the three months:\n\n- Weight for Month 1 (oldest): 0.2\n- Weight for Month 2: 0.3\n- Weight for Month 3 (most recent): 0.5\n\nThe weighted moving average forecast can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Forecast} = (w_1 \times D_1) + (w_2 \times D_2) + (w_3 \times D_3)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ w_1, w_2, w_3 $ are the weights,\n- $ D_1, D_2, D_3 $ are the demand values for the respective months.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Forecast} = (0.2 \times 100) + (0.3 \times 150) + (0.5 \times 200)\n$$\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- $ 0.2 \times 100 = 20 $\n- $ 0.3 \times 150 = 45 $\n- $ 0.5 \times 200 = 100 $\n\nNow, summing these values:\n\n$$\n\text{Forecast} = 20 + 45 + 100 = 165\n$$\n\nThus, the forecasted demand for the next month using the weighted moving average is **165 units**.\n\n### Advantages of Weighted Moving Average\n\n1. **Flexibility**: By adjusting the weights, businesses can tailor the forecast to reflect their understanding of market dynamics.\n2. **Responsiveness**: More recent data is given more importance, making the forecast more responsive to changes in demand patterns.\n3. **Simplicity**: The method is straightforward to implement and understand, making it accessible for various business applications.\n\nIn summary, the weighted moving average is a powerful tool in demand forecasting that allows businesses to make informed decisions based on historical data while accounting for the changing nature of demand.
