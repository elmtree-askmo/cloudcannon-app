    What is the SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES) and how does it function?
answer: >-
    The SEBI Complaints Redress System (SCORES) is a web-based centralized grievance redressal platform launched by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2011. It is designed to facilitate investors in lodging complaints against market participants regulated by SEBI, such as listed companies and registered intermediaries. The system allows investors to submit their grievances online, track the status of their complaints, and receive updates on the redressal process from anywhere.\n\nKey features of SCORES include:\n\n1. **Online Complaint Submission**: Investors can lodge complaints related to the securities market through the SCORES platform. This includes issues with listed companies and SEBI-registered intermediaries.\n\n2. **Tracking and Monitoring**: Once a complaint is lodged, investors can track its status online. The platform provides updates on the redressal process, ensuring transparency.\n\n3. **Auto-Routing and Auto-Escalation**: The new version of SCORES, referred to as SCORES 2.0, enhances the efficiency of the complaint redressal mechanism by implementing auto-routing and auto-escalation features. This helps in reducing the timelines for resolving complaints.\n\n4. **Mobile Application**: SEBI has also introduced a mobile application for SCORES, allowing investors to lodge complaints and track them via their smartphones, making the process more accessible.\n\n5. **Integration with Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)**: As of a circular issued on September 20, 2023, SEBI is linking SCORES with its Online Dispute Resolution platform to further streamline the grievance redressal process. This integration is set to take effect from December 4, 2023.\n\n6. **Disposal of Complaints**: A complaint is considered "disposed" or "resolved" only when SEBI is satisfied with the redressal action taken. The status is updated on the SCORES platform by SEBI itself.\n\n7. **Historical Data**: The old version of SCORES (www.scores.gov.in) was closed on March 28, 2024, and no new complaints can be lodged there. However, investors can check the status of their previously lodged complaints that were pending as of that date.\n\nOverall, SCORES serves as a vital tool for enhancing investor protection and ensuring that grievances are addressed in a timely and efficient manner. For more information, investors can visit the SCORES portal at [https://scores.gov.in](https://scores.gov.in) or contact SEBI's toll-free helpline.
