    What are the key components of the housing assistance provided by India to Maldives?
answer: >-
    The housing assistance provided by India to the Maldives encompasses several key components aimed at addressing the housing challenges faced by the Maldivian population. Here are the main aspects of this assistance:\n\n1. **Construction of Housing Units**: India has committed to constructing a total of 4,000 housing units in Hulhumalé. This initiative is funded through the EXIM Bank of India's Buyer's Credit financing, which amounts to approximately USD 227 million. Recently, 700 housing units from the second phase of this project were officially handed over to the Maldivian government during a meeting between President Dr. Mohamed Muizzu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n2. **Support for Ongoing Projects**: The assistance includes efforts to accelerate ongoing social housing projects that are already supported by India. This is part of a broader strategy to meet the growing housing demand in the Maldives.\n\n3. **Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP)**: India is extending full support for the timely completion of the flagship Greater Malé Connectivity Project, which aims to enhance infrastructure and connectivity within the Maldives. This project is crucial for improving access to housing and other essential services.\n\n4. **Feasibility Studies**: As part of the housing assistance, India is also undertaking feasibility studies to explore connections between various islands, which will facilitate better housing and infrastructure development across the archipelago.\n\n5. **Economic Support**: In addition to housing, India has provided financial support to the Maldivian government, including rolling over a $50 million Treasury Bill to provide essential budgetary relief. This financial assistance is intended to strengthen the Maldivian economy, which indirectly supports housing initiatives.\n\n6. **Job Creation**: The housing projects not only aim to improve living conditions but also create jobs in construction and related sectors, thereby contributing to the overall economic development of the Maldives.\n\nThese components reflect India's commitment to enhancing the living standards in the Maldives through targeted housing assistance and broader economic support.
