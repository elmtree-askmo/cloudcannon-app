    What initiatives have corporations taken to ensure ethical sourcing in the seafood industry?
answer: >-
    Corporations in the seafood industry have undertaken various initiatives to ensure ethical sourcing and address labor and human rights issues. Here are some notable efforts:\n\n1. **Sustainability Commitments**: Sysco Corporation, in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), has announced its 2025 seafood sustainability commitments. This renewed partnership focuses on more sustainable seafood sourcing, reflecting a broader trend in the industry towards responsible sourcing and ethical business practices.\n\n2. **Transparency and Traceability**: Companies are increasingly investing in technologies and practices that enhance transparency and traceability within their supply chains. For instance, Anova has committed to improving seafood sustainability and transparency by addressing the impacts of megatrends on seafood integrity, which includes globalization and industry consolidation.\n\n3. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Programs**: The rise of CSR in the seafood industry has led to seafood suppliers developing their own programs to meet the sourcing commitments of buyers. This is largely driven by increasing public awareness and campaigns from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) advocating for sustainable practices.\n\n4. **Collaboration with NGOs**: There is a growing trend of collaboration between sustainability-focused NGOs and seafood companies. This partnership aims to tackle major issues in the industry through strategic frameworks that identify necessary steps to achieve ethical sourcing goals.\n\n5. **Tools for Ethical Seafood Sourcing (TESS)**: TESS serves as a hub for resources and information that help businesses address social responsibility challenges in their seafood supply chains. It provides access to various initiatives and guidelines that promote ethical sourcing practices.\n\n6. **Investor Engagement**: Backed by significant investors, initiatives have been launched to address material business risks associated with insufficient supply chain transparency among major seafood companies. This engagement seeks to encourage these companies to adopt better practices regarding ethical sourcing.\n\n7. **Regulatory Compliance**: The European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is pushing the seafood industry towards greater transparency and accountability in reporting sustainability practices, which includes ethical sourcing.\n\nThese initiatives reflect a concerted effort by corporations in the seafood industry to improve ethical sourcing and address the pressing issues of modern slavery and labor rights within their supply chains.
