    What legislation has been proposed for the social security of gig workers in India?
answer: >-
    In India, the social security of gig workers has been addressed through several legislative measures, particularly the Code on Social Security, 2020. This code introduced significant provisions aimed at providing social security benefits to gig workers and platform workers for the first time. It includes measures related to life and disability cover, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection. The code also mandates the establishment of a Social Security Fund to support these initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Bill, 2023, was tabled in the Rajasthan Assembly, making it the first state-level legislation in India to guarantee social security for gig workers. This bill proposes to register all gig workers and aggregators in the state and includes provisions for a welfare fee, which would be levied on transactions conducted through online platforms. This fee is intended to fund the social security measures outlined in the bill. The legislation also imposes monetary penalties on aggregators that fail to comply with its provisions.\n\nOverall, while the Code on Social Security, 2020 provides a framework for social security for gig workers at the national level, the Rajasthan bill represents a significant step towards ensuring these workers receive the protections and benefits they have long sought.
