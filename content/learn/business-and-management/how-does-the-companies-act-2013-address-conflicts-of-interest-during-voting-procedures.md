    How does the Companies Act 2013 address conflicts of interest during voting procedures?
answer: >-
    The Companies Act, 2013 addresses conflicts of interest during voting procedures primarily through the provisions outlined in Section 184, which mandates the disclosure of interest by directors. This section requires that any director who is directly or indirectly interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company must declare the nature of their interest to the other directors at the meeting. This disclosure is crucial for maintaining transparency and ensuring that all board members are aware of potential conflicts that may affect decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, the Act stipulates that directors with a conflict of interest are precluded from participating in discussions and voting on matters related to that interest. This is a continuation of similar provisions from the previous Companies Act, 1956, which aimed to protect the integrity of corporate governance by preventing directors from influencing decisions in which they have a personal stake.\n\nThe overarching goal of these provisions is to promote ethical business practices and protect the interests of shareholders by ensuring that decisions are made fairly and without undue influence from conflicted directors. By requiring disclosure and restricting participation in relevant discussions and votes, the Companies Act, 2013 seeks to uphold corporate integrity and accountability.
