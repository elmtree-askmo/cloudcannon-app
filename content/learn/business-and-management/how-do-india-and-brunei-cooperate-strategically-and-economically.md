    How do India and Brunei cooperate strategically and economically?
answer: >-
    India and Brunei have been enhancing their strategic and economic cooperation over the past decade, marked by significant diplomatic engagement and mutual commitments to strengthen bilateral ties. A pivotal moment in this relationship was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Brunei, which underscored the importance of Brunei in India's broader Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific Vision.\n\nKey areas of cooperation include:\n\n1. **Economic Cooperation**: India and Brunei have agreed to deepen their economic ties, particularly in sectors beyond oil and gas, such as information and communication technology (ICT), finance, and renewable energy. The trade between the two nations was approximately $286.20 million last year, indicating potential for growth.\n\n2. **Defence Collaboration**: Both countries have recognized the importance of enhancing cooperation in defence. This includes regular exchanges and training, as well as discussions on regional security issues. The leaders signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to facilitate collaboration in satellite and launch vehicle operations, which is a significant step in their strategic partnership.\n\n3. **Space Cooperation**: The partnership extends to the space sector, with discussions on long-term cooperation in satellite technology and operations. This reflects a shared interest in leveraging space capabilities for mutual benefit.\n\n4. **People-to-People Relations**: Enhancing cultural and social ties is also a priority, as both nations aim to foster closer connections between their peoples.\n\n5. **Regional Security**: Given Brunei's strategic location in the South China Sea, both countries are keen on addressing regional security challenges, particularly in the context of China's influence in the area.\n\nOverall, the India-Brunei relationship is evolving into a comprehensive partnership that encompasses economic, scientific, and strategic dimensions, with a shared vision for future collaboration.
