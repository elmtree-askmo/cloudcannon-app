    What are the key components of the proposed Karnataka Job Reservation Bill?
answer: >-
    The proposed Karnataka Job Reservation Bill, officially titled the "Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024," includes several key components aimed at reserving jobs for local residents in the private sector. Here are the main features of the bill:\n\n1. **Job Quotas**: The bill mandates a reservation of 50% of management jobs and 75% of non-management jobs for local candidates in private sector companies. This is intended to ensure that a significant portion of employment opportunities is available to residents of Karnataka.\n\n2. **Definition of Local Candidates**: A "local candidate" is defined as an individual who is born in Karnataka, has been domiciled in the state for at least 15 years, and is proficient in reading, writing, and speaking Kannada. Additionally, they must possess a secondary school certificate with Kannada as a language.\n\n3. **Enforcement and Penalties**: The bill proposes the establishment of a Nodal Agency to oversee compliance. Companies that fail to adhere to the job reservation requirements may face fines ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹25,000, with daily penalties for ongoing violations.\n\n4. **Training and Exemptions**: Companies are required to either train local candidates or seek exemptions from the job reservation mandates. They must retain a minimum of 25% of management roles and 50% of non-management roles for local candidates.\n\n5. **Public Sector Reservations**: The bill also includes provisions for 100% reservation for locals in Group 'C' and 'D' jobs in Central government departments and public sector undertakings (PSUs) operating in Karnataka, along with specific quotas for Group 'A' and 'B' jobs.\n\nThe bill has sparked significant debate and backlash from industry groups, including Nasscom, due to its potential impact on major companies operating in the state, such as Google and Intel. As of now, the bill has been put on hold following concerns raised by various stakeholders.
