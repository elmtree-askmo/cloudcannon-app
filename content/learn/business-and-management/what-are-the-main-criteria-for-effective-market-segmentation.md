    What are the main criteria for effective market segmentation?
answer: >-
    The main criteria for effective market segmentation can be summarized using the acronym ADAMS, which stands for:\n\n1. **Accessible**: The market segment should be reachable and serviceable. This means that the company must be able to effectively communicate with and deliver products or services to the segment.\n\n2. **Differentiable**: The segments must be distinct from one another, meaning that they respond differently to marketing strategies. This differentiation allows marketers to tailor their approaches to meet the unique needs of each segment.\n\n3. **Actionable**: The company must be able to develop effective marketing strategies to attract and serve the segments. This implies that the organization has the resources and capabilities to implement targeted marketing efforts.\n\n4. **Measurable**: The size and purchasing power of the market segment should be quantifiable. This means that there should be reliable data available to assess the segment's characteristics and potential.\n\n5. **Substantial**: The segment should be large enough to be profitable. It must warrant the investment of marketing resources, ensuring that the potential return justifies the effort.\n\nThese criteria are essential for evaluating market segments within the broader context of the segmentation, targeting, and positioning (STP) model. By adhering to these criteria, businesses can create more effective marketing strategies that resonate with their target audiences, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
