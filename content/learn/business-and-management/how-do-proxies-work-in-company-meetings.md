    How do proxies work in company meetings?
answer: >-
    In the context of company meetings under the Companies Act, 2013, proxies play a significant role in facilitating shareholder participation. The term 'proxy' refers to both the individual appointed by a member to attend and vote on their behalf, as well as the instrument or document that formalizes this appointment.\n\nAccording to Section 105 of the Companies Act, 2013, any member of a company who is entitled to attend and vote at a meeting can appoint another person as a proxy to attend and vote on their behalf. This provision ensures that shareholders who cannot physically attend meetings still have a voice in the decision-making process. However, it is important to note that a proxy does not have the right to speak at the meeting and can only vote on a poll.\n\nThe appointment of a proxy must be done using a specific form prescribed by the company, which typically includes details such as the shareholder's name and the proxy's name. Proxies are counted towards the quorum of the meeting, and they can also demand a poll if necessary. This means that the presence of proxies can significantly influence the outcome of votes during meetings.\n\nFurthermore, the proxy must adhere to the instructions provided by the appointing shareholder when casting votes. This mechanism allows shareholders to participate in corporate governance even when they are unable to attend meetings in person, thereby enhancing the democratic process within the company.\n\nIn summary, proxies serve as a vital tool for shareholder engagement in company meetings, ensuring that all members have the opportunity to influence decisions, regardless of their physical presence.
