    How are REITs and InvITs being adjusted under the new taxation rules?
answer: >-
    The recent changes in taxation rules for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) were introduced in the Union Budget 2023, which was presented on February 1, 2023. These changes will take effect from April 1, 2024, and they aim to enhance the scope of taxation for these investment vehicles.\n\nKey adjustments under the new taxation rules include:\n\n1. **Taxation of Distributions**: A significant change is the taxation of a portion of distributions made by REITs and InvITs, which will now be classified as 'repayment of loans' or return of capital. This portion will be taxed at the unitholder's marginal income tax rate. This is a shift from the previous treatment where certain income was exempt from taxation.\n\n2. **Capital Gains Tax**: The taxation on the sale of units remains unchanged. Short-term capital gains (STCG) tax on units held for less than 36 months is still set at 15%, while long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on gains exceeding â‚¹1 lakh is at 10%.\n\n3. **Interest and Rental Income**: The taxation on interest income and rental income from these trusts remains unchanged and will continue to be taxed as per the applicable income tax slabs.\n\n4. **Impact on Investors**: Experts predict that these new rules could lead to an increase in tax liabilities for investors, with estimates suggesting an additional tax burden of 60 to 150 basis points. This could potentially reduce the attractiveness of investing in REITs and InvITs.\n\n5. **Regulatory Support**: The market regulator, SEBI, has shown support for the growth of this asset class, and the government has softened the initial tax proposals in response to industry pushback, ensuring that only a specified portion of distributions will be taxable.\n\nOverall, these changes reflect the government's intent to widen the tax base while addressing previous exemptions that were in place for REITs and InvITs. The adjustments are expected to have a significant impact on how these investment vehicles are perceived and utilized by investors moving forward.
