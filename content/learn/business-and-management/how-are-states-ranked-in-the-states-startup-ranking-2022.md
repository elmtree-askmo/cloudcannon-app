    How are states ranked in the States' Startup Ranking 2022?
answer: >-
    The States' Startup Ranking 2022, released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in January 2023, evaluates the performance of Indian states and Union Territories (UTs) in fostering startup ecosystems. The ranking is based on a comprehensive framework that includes 25 action points, which are designed to assess the support provided for startup establishment and growth.\n\n### Ranking Methodology\n\n1. **Categories**: States and UTs are divided into two categories based on population:\n   - **Category A**: States with a population greater than 1 crore.\n   - **Category B**: States with a population less than 1 crore.\n\n2. **Reform Areas**: The evaluation focuses on seven broad reform areas, which encompass various aspects of the startup ecosystem, including policy implementation, infrastructure, and support mechanisms.\n\n3. **Scoring Criteria**: The scoring is based on absolute metrics, with a maximum score assigned to each action point. For example, access to information through state startup portals can score a maximum of 6 points, with sub-points contributing to the overall score.\n\n4. **Feedback Mechanism**: A feedback mechanism is employed to gather data from states, ensuring that the ranking reflects the actual conditions and support available to startups.\n\n5. **Participation**: In the 2022 ranking, 26 states and 7 UTs participated, with all 8 northeastern states also taking part.\n\n### Results\n\nThe top performers in the States' Startup Ranking 2022 were:\n- **Gujarat**\n- **Karnataka**\n- **Kerala**\n- **Tamil Nadu**\n\nThese states were recognized for their robust startup policies and ecosystem-building efforts. Additionally, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, and Jammu & Kashmir were identified as emerging ecosystems, indicating their potential for growth in the startup sector.\n\nThe ranking not only highlights the best-performing states but also encourages all states to develop dedicated startup policies and track their progress annually, fostering a competitive environment that benefits the overall startup ecosystem in India.
