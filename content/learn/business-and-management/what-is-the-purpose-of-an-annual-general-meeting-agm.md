    What is the purpose of an Annual General Meeting (AGM)?
answer: >-
    The purpose of an Annual General Meeting (AGM) is multifaceted and plays a crucial role in corporate governance. According to Section 96 of the Companies Act, 2013, every company, except for One Person Companies (OPCs), is required to hold an AGM each year. Here are the key purposes and functions of an AGM:\n\n1. **Safeguarding Shareholder Interests**: AGMs are primarily conducted to protect the interests of the company's shareholders. They provide a platform for shareholders to engage with the company's management and express their views.\n\n2. **Reporting on Company Performance**: During the AGM, the company reports on its performance over the past year, discussing financial results, operational achievements, and future strategies. This transparency is essential for maintaining trust and accountability.\n\n3. **Decision-Making**: AGMs allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as the election of board members, approval of financial statements, and other significant corporate actions. This voting process is a fundamental aspect of shareholder rights.\n\n4. **Engagement and Communication**: AGMs facilitate open communication between shareholders and the company's management. Shareholders can ask questions, raise concerns, and provide feedback, fostering a collaborative environment.\n\n5. **Compliance with Legal Requirements**: The AGM is mandated by law, and companies must adhere to specific legal obligations regarding its timing, conduct, and content. This ensures that companies operate within a framework of accountability and governance.\n\n6. **Encouraging Transparency**: By holding AGMs, companies promote transparency in their operations, allowing shareholders to gain insights into the company's governance and management practices.\n\nIn summary, AGMs serve as a cornerstone of corporate governance, enhancing transparency, accountability, and shareholder engagement. They are essential for maintaining a healthy relationship between a company's management and its shareholders, ensuring that the company operates in the best interests of its stakeholders.
