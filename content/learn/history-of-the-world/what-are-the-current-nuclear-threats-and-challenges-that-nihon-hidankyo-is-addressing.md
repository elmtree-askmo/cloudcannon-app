    What are the current nuclear threats and challenges that Nihon Hidankyo is addressing?
answer: >-
    Nihon Hidankyo, also known as the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, is currently addressing several nuclear threats and challenges, particularly in the context of global nuclear disarmament and the ongoing risks associated with nuclear weapons. The organization, which comprises atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has been recognized for its decades-long campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons, culminating in the award of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nOne of the primary challenges Nihon Hidankyo is confronting is the increasing nuclear threat posed by geopolitical tensions, notably highlighted by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. This situation has raised concerns about the potential use of nuclear weapons, which Nihon Hidankyo vehemently opposes. The organization emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nuclear taboo, which has prevented the use of nuclear weapons in warfare for nearly 80 years, and views this taboo as essential for a peaceful future.\n\nAdditionally, Nihon Hidankyo is actively working to raise awareness about the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons through witness testimonies from survivors. The organization aims to educate the public and policymakers about the horrors of nuclear warfare, advocating for disarmament and the abolition of nuclear weapons globally.\n\nIn summary, Nihon Hidankyo is addressing the current nuclear threats by advocating for disarmament, raising awareness about the dangers of nuclear weapons, and striving to maintain the nuclear taboo in a world where such threats are becoming increasingly pronounced.
