    Why did the dodo become extinct?
answer: >-
    The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) became extinct primarily due to a combination of human activities and ecological factors. Native to the island of Mauritius, the dodo had evolved in an environment without natural predators, which made it particularly vulnerable to human exploitation. When Portuguese sailors first discovered the dodo around 1507, they found the bird to be an easy source of fresh meat, leading to significant hunting pressure.\n\nSeveral key factors contributed to the rapid decline of the dodo population:\n\n1. **Hunting by Humans**: The arrival of humans on Mauritius led to extensive hunting of the dodo. The bird's lack of fear of humans made it an easy target, and it was quickly hunted to near extinction.\n\n2. **Habitat Destruction**: As human settlers established themselves on the island, they cleared forests for agriculture and settlement, leading to significant habitat loss for the dodo. This destruction further reduced the available nesting sites and food sources for the birds.\n\n3. **Invasive Species**: Humans also introduced invasive species such as rats, pigs, and monkeys to the island. These animals preyed on dodo eggs and competed for food resources, exacerbating the decline of the dodo population.\n\n4. **Limited Reproductive Capacity**: The dodo had a slow reproductive rate, which made it difficult for the population to recover from the pressures of hunting and habitat loss. With only a small population remaining, the species was unable to sustain itself.\n\nThe dodo's extinction occurred by the late 17th century, within less than 100 years of its first documentation. This rapid decline serves as a poignant example of how human activities can lead to the extinction of species, particularly those that have evolved in isolated environments without significant threats. The dodo has since become a symbol of the broader global biodiversity crisis and the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect vulnerable species from similar fates.
