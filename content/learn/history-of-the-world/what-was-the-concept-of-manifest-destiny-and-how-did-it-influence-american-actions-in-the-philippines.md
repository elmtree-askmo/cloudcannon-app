    What was the concept of Manifest Destiny and how did it influence American actions in the Philippines?
answer: >-
    The concept of Manifest Destiny, which emerged in the mid-19th century, was rooted in the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent. Coined by journalist John O'Sullivan in 1845, the term encapsulated a sense of divine right and national superiority that justified the displacement of Native peoples and the annexation of territories. By the late 19th century, this ideology evolved into what is often referred to as the "New Manifest Destiny," which extended beyond continental borders to include overseas territories, particularly in the Pacific.\n\nIn the context of American actions in the Philippines, Manifest Destiny played a significant role in shaping public opinion and government policy during the late 1890s. Following the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States acquired the Philippines, which was seen by many as a fulfillment of Manifest Destiny. The war was often described as a "splendid little war," and the annexation of the Philippines was framed as a moral obligation to civilize and uplift the Filipino people, reflecting the paternalistic attitudes associated with the concept of the "White Man's Burden."\n\nPresident William McKinley, in particular, defended the annexation of the Philippines by arguing that it was the United States' duty to educate and govern the islands, which he believed were incapable of self-rule. This justification was rooted in a belief in American cultural and racial superiority, which was a hallmark of the New Manifest Destiny. The resulting Philippine-American War (1899-1902) was marked by significant violence and resistance from Filipinos, leading to the loss of approximately 100,000 Filipino lives, with estimates of total casualties, including famine, reaching up to 1,000,000.\n\nThe influence of Manifest Destiny on American actions in the Philippines illustrates how imperialism was often justified through a lens of moral obligation and national destiny, despite the profound consequences for the colonized populations. This ideology not only shaped the initial annexation but also laid the groundwork for ongoing American colonial policies in the region.
