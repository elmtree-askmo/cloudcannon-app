    What were some early resistance efforts by enslaved people during the American Revolution?
answer: >-
    During the American Revolution, enslaved people engaged in various forms of resistance, which were significant in challenging the institution of slavery. Some of the early resistance efforts included:\n\n1. **Petitioning for Freedom**: Enslaved individuals actively petitioned for their freedom. For instance, in 1779, Nero Brewster and 19 other enslaved people in New Hampshire submitted petitions to the legislature, asserting their natural right to freedom.\n\n2. **Running Away**: Many enslaved people took the opportunity to escape, particularly as the British offered freedom to those who would join their cause. Tens of thousands of enslaved and free Black Americans sought to challenge slavery by fleeing to British lines, where they hoped to gain their freedom.\n\n3. **Military Service**: Enslaved individuals also participated in the military efforts of both the British and American forces. Approximately 20,000 African Americans joined the British army, motivated by promises of freedom, while around 5,000 fought for the Patriot cause. Notably, Lord Dunmore's Proclamation in 1775 offered freedom to enslaved men who would fight for the British, leading to the formation of units like the Ethiopian Regiment.\n\n4. **Armed Rebellion**: There were instances of violent resistance, including slave revolts and rebellions that occurred throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. These acts of rebellion were part of a broader pattern of resistance against the oppressive system of chattel slavery.\n\n5. **Cultural and Ideological Resistance**: Enslaved people also resisted through cultural expressions and ideologies that emphasized their rights to freedom. The rhetoric of liberty that permeated the American Revolution inspired many to assert their own claims to freedom and equality.\n\nThese resistance efforts were crucial in highlighting the contradictions of a revolution that sought liberty while simultaneously denying it to a significant portion of the population. The actions of enslaved people during this period laid the groundwork for future abolitionist movements and the ongoing struggle for civil rights.
