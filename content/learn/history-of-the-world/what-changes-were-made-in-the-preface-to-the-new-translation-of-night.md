    What changes were made in the preface to the new translation of "Night"?
answer: >-
    In the preface to the new translation of Elie Wiesel's "Night," several significant changes and updates were made compared to the original edition. One of the primary changes highlighted by Marion Wiesel, Elie Wiesel's wife and the translator of the new edition, is the correction of factual errors, including a reference to the author's age when he arrived at Birkenau, the entry point for Auschwitz, in 1944. \n\nAdditionally, the new translation modifies certain language choices to better reflect the experiences described. For instance, the original English translation used the word "copulate," which was later changed to "flirt" in subsequent printings. In the new edition, the phrasing was further refined to describe the youths as having "caressed one another."\n\nElie Wiesel's preface also serves as a powerful testament to the enduring relevance of "Night." He reflects on the legacy of his work and emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust to ensure that its horrors are never forgotten. Wiesel articulates his commitment to sharing these memories and the lessons learned from that dark period in history, reinforcing the moral responsibility to act against injustice and to foster hope and compassion for humanity.\n\nOverall, the new translation not only corrects factual inaccuracies but also enhances the emotional depth and clarity of Wiesel's harrowing account of his experiences during the Holocaust.
