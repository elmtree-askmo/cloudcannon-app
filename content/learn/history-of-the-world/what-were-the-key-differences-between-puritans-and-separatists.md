    What were the key differences between Puritans and Separatists?
answer: >-
    The key differences between Puritans and Separatists primarily revolve around their relationship with the Church of England and their approaches to religious reform.\n\n1. **Relationship with the Church of England**:\n   - **Puritans**: This group sought to reform the Church of England from within. They believed that the church retained too many Catholic practices and sought to "purify" it, advocating for a more rigorous Protestant faith while remaining part of the established church.\n   - **Separatists**: Also known as Pilgrims, Separatists believed that the Church of England was beyond reform and sought to completely break away from it. They aimed to establish independent congregations that were free from the perceived corruption of the established church.\n\n2. **Motivation and Identity**:\n   - **Puritans**: They were motivated by a desire to create a "city upon a hill," a model society based on their religious beliefs, while still being part of the broader Church of England. They believed they could live out their faith within the existing church structure.\n   - **Separatists**: Their motivation stemmed from a strong sense of religious identity and the conviction that true believers should separate themselves from the Church of England to form their own communities based on their interpretations of Christianity.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - The Puritans began migrating to America in the 1630s, seeking to reform the church while establishing their own colonies. In contrast, the Separatists, who were among the passengers on the Mayflower, established Plymouth Colony in 1620, fleeing persecution and seeking a place to practice their faith freely.\n\nIn summary, while both groups were part of the broader Protestant movement and sought to address issues within the Church of England, Puritans aimed for reform from within, whereas Separatists sought complete separation and independence from the church.
