    Who was Mangal Pandey and what was his role in the Revolt of 1857?
answer: >-
    Mangal Pandey was an Indian soldier born on July 19, 1827, in Akbarpur, India. He served as a sepoy in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry of the British East India Company. Pandey is best known for his pivotal role in the events leading up to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, often referred to as the "Sepoy Mutiny" or "India's First War of Independence."\n\nOn March 29, 1857, Mangal Pandey attacked British officers, marking the first major incident of the uprising. His actions were fueled by growing resentment among Indian soldiers towards British policies, particularly the introduction of the new Enfield rifle, which was rumored to be greased with animal fat offensive to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. This incident sparked widespread mutiny among the sepoys of the Bengal Army, ultimately leading to a larger rebellion against British rule.\n\nPandey's rebellion was significant as it symbolized the beginning of organized resistance against British colonialism in India. He was arrested and subsequently executed on April 8, 1857, becoming a martyr and a symbol of resistance against oppression. His legacy is celebrated in India, where he is often referred to as "Shaheed Mangal Pandey," and he is recognized as one of the first freedom fighters in the struggle for Indian independence.
