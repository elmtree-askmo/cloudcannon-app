    What is the 'Dorian' Invasion, and how does it relate to the history of Sparta?
answer: >-
    The Dorian Invasion is a historical theory that posits a migration of Dorian Greeks into the Peloponnese around the 12th century BC. This event is often associated with the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and is considered a significant factor in the transition to the Greek Dark Ages, a period characterized by a decline in population, loss of literacy, and the collapse of urban centers.\n\nThe Dorian Greeks, a group of tribes, are believed to have invaded and settled in southern Greece, which included the region that would become Sparta. This migration is linked to the rise of Sparta and the establishment of its unique social structure. Literary sources, particularly fragments from poets like Tyrtaeus, reference the Dorian origins of the Spartans, suggesting that the narrative of conquest and settlement played a crucial role in shaping Spartan identity and culture.\n\nThe myth surrounding the Dorian Invasion also includes the idea that the Dorians, along with the Heraclids, became the dominant force in the Peloponnese, influencing the region's cultural and linguistic landscape. This narrative is reflected in the works of historians such as Herodotus and Thucydides, who provide insights into the historical context of Sparta and its development.\n\nIn summary, the Dorian Invasion is integral to understanding the history of Sparta, as it marks a pivotal moment that contributed to the formation of Spartan society and its subsequent dominance in the region. The invasion is not only a historical event but also a foundational myth that has influenced Spartan identity throughout history.
