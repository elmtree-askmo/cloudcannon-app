    How does India maintain strategic autonomy and its global positioning?
answer: >-
    India maintains its strategic autonomy and global positioning through a multifaceted approach that emphasizes independent decision-making, active participation in multilateral forums, and the cultivation of diverse international partnerships.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The concept of strategic autonomy has been a cornerstone of India's foreign policy since its independence, initially articulated through the Non-Alignment Movement. This principle has evolved into a broader framework that includes multi-alignment and a de-hyphenated approach to international relations, allowing India to engage with various countries on its own terms.\n\n2. **Active Participation in Multilateral Forums**: India actively engages in multilateral organizations such as the G-20, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). By championing platforms like BRICS, India positions itself as a leader advocating for the interests of smaller nations, particularly in the Global South, which enhances its influence in global governance and addresses regional security issues.\n\n3. **Independent Foreign Policy**: India's foreign policy is characterized by a commitment to making independent choices that reflect its national interests. This autonomy allows India to navigate complex global dynamics without being overly reliant on any single power. For instance, while India has maintained a historically close relationship with Russia, it also seeks to balance its ties with Western nations, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions.\n\n4. **Strategic Partnerships**: India has developed strategic partnerships with major powers, including the United States, Japan, and Australia, while also engaging with regional organizations to enhance cooperation. This approach enables India to maximize its global influence and address various challenges, such as border disputes and regional rivalries.\n\n5. **Navigating Global Challenges**: India's foreign policy is also shaped by its responses to global challenges, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict and its evolving stance in West Asia. By carefully calibrating its diplomatic responses, India aims to maintain its strategic autonomy while addressing complex regional dynamics.\n\n6. **Policy Priorities**: Indiaâ€™s foreign policy initiatives, such as the Act East Policy and the Neighborhood First Policy, reflect its commitment to strengthening ties with East Asia and enhancing regional cooperation. These initiatives are designed to uphold India's strategic autonomy in a multipolar world.\n\nIn summary, India's strategic autonomy is maintained through a combination of historical principles, active multilateral engagement, independent decision-making, and the establishment of diverse international partnerships. This multifaceted approach allows India to navigate the complexities of global politics while safeguarding its national interests.
