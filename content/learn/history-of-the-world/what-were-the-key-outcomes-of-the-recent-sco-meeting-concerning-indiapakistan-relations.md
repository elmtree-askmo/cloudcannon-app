    What were the key outcomes of the recent SCO meeting concerning India-Pakistan relations?
answer: >-
    The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, held in Islamabad on October 15-16, 2024, marked a significant moment for India-Pakistan relations. Here are the key outcomes from the summit concerning these ties:\n\n1. **Cautious Movement in Relations**: The meeting saw some cautious progress in India-Pakistan relations, with informal interactions between India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. This interaction was characterized by a more positive atmosphere compared to previous encounters, suggesting a potential thaw in relations.\n\n2. **Focus on Regional Cooperation**: Both nations participated in discussions that emphasized the importance of regional cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism. This aligns with the SCO's objectives, as both India and Pakistan are part of the SCOâ€™s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).\n\n3. **India's Stance on the Belt and Road Initiative**: Notably, India remained the only SCO member that did not endorse China's Belt and Road Initiative during the summit. This highlights India's cautious approach to its regional engagements, particularly concerning initiatives that it perceives as undermining its sovereignty.\n\n4. **Potential for Future Engagements**: The summit sparked hopes for improved ties, with discussions around future events, such as the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, which could promote goodwill between the two nations. The informal dialogues at the summit indicate a willingness to engage constructively, which could pave the way for further diplomatic efforts.\n\n5. **Pakistan's Role as a Regional Player**: The summit also allowed Pakistan to showcase its potential as a regional player, challenging narratives of its diplomatic isolation. This shift in perception could facilitate a more active role for Pakistan in regional diplomacy, which may indirectly benefit India-Pakistan relations.\n\nOverall, the SCO meeting served as a platform for both countries to engage in constructive dialogue, highlighting the potential of multilateral forums to foster cooperation and reduce mistrust between India and Pakistan.
