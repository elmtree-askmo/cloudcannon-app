    Which diplomats have been expelled by both India and Canada?
answer: >-
    In the recent diplomatic standoff between India and Canada, both countries expelled six diplomats, including their respective ambassadors. This escalation is linked to the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023, which Canada alleges involved Indian government agents. \n\nSpecifically, Canada expelled Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma along with five other Indian diplomats, citing their involvement in a broader campaign of violence and intimidation against Sikh separatists in Canada. In response, India expelled a senior Canadian diplomat, although the specific name of the Canadian diplomat expelled has not been detailed in the gathered information.\n\nThis tit-for-tat expulsion reflects the growing tensions and serious allegations exchanged between the two nations, with Canada accusing India of orchestrating criminal activities on its soil, which India has firmly denied.
