    How did Dobbs v Jackson impact the legal landscape of reproductive rights?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court's decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022) significantly altered the legal landscape of reproductive rights in the United States by overturning the long-standing precedents set by *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992). This ruling declared that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, effectively returning the authority to regulate abortion to individual states and their legislatures.\n\nPrior to *Dobbs*, the legal framework established by *Roe* and *Casey* recognized abortion as a fundamental right, particularly prior to the point of fetal viability. The *Dobbs* decision shifted this paradigm, stating that states could impose their own regulations on abortion without the requirement to meet strict scrutiny standards. Instead, the Court indicated that a rational-basis review would apply, which is a much lower standard for evaluating the constitutionality of state laws.\n\nAs a result of this ruling, many states enacted "trigger laws" that immediately banned or severely restricted abortion access once *Roe* was overturned. Reports indicate that, shortly after the decision, numerous abortion clinics across various states ceased operations, with at least 66 clinics in 15 states stopping abortion services within the first 100 days post-*Dobbs*.\n\nThe *Dobbs* ruling has also led to a surge in research highlighting the negative impacts of restricted access to abortion services. Studies have documented various harms, including increased maternal mortality rates, economic disadvantages for those seeking abortions, and broader implications for reproductive health care access.\n\nIn summary, *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* has reshaped the legal framework surrounding reproductive rights in the U.S., leading to a patchwork of state laws that vary widely in terms of access to abortion services, and has prompted ongoing debates about the implications for women's health and autonomy.
