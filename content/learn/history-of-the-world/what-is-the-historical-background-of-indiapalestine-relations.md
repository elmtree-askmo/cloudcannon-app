    What is the historical background of India-Palestine relations?
answer: >-
    The historical background of India-Palestine relations is marked by a consistent support for the Palestinian cause, which has evolved through various political, economic, and cultural dimensions over the decades. \n\n1. **Early Support**: India's support for Palestine dates back to the mid-20th century, particularly during the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. In 1947, India voted against the United Nations partition plan for Palestine, which proposed the establishment of separate Jewish and Arab states. Instead, India advocated for a federal state with special status for Jerusalem, reflecting its commitment to Palestinian statehood.\n\n2. **Recognition of the PLO**: In 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as "the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." This recognition was formalized with the establishment of a PLO office in New Delhi in 1975 and full diplomatic relations in 1980.\n\n3. **Economic and Humanitarian Support**: Over the years, India has provided substantial economic assistance to Palestine, including budgetary support and medical aid. For instance, India has contributed approximately US$ 141 million to Palestinian causes and offered a Line of Credit worth USD 50 million in July 2021.\n\n4. **Diplomatic Relations with Israel**: The 1990s marked a significant shift in India's foreign policy with the establishment of full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992. This pragmatic approach allowed India to balance its historical support for Palestine while engaging with Israel, reflecting a move from a strict policy of Non-Alignment to one of strategic autonomy.\n\n5. **Cultural Exchanges**: India has also engaged in cultural exchanges with Palestine, exemplified by youth delegations visiting each other's countries, which fosters mutual understanding and solidarity.\n\n6. **Recent Developments**: Despite the strengthening of ties with Israel, India has maintained cordial relations with Palestine, continuing to express solidarity with the Palestinian cause. High-level visits from Palestinian leadership to India have occurred as recently as 2017, indicating ongoing diplomatic engagement.\n\nIn summary, India's relations with Palestine have been characterized by a strong historical commitment to the Palestinian cause, evolving through various phases of diplomatic engagement, economic support, and cultural exchange, while also navigating its relationship with Israel.
