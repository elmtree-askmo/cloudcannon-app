    What were the key events leading up to the 1715 Rebellion?
answer: >-
    The key events leading up to the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, also known as the Fifteen, were shaped by a combination of political discontent, dynastic struggles, and the aftermath of the Acts of Union in 1707, which united Scotland and England. Here are the significant events and factors that contributed to the rebellion:\n\n1. **Acts of Union (1707)**: The unification of the Scottish and English parliaments was deeply unpopular among many Scots, particularly those who supported the Jacobite cause. This act was seen as a betrayal of Scottish sovereignty and fueled resentment against the Hanoverian monarchy.\n\n2. **Death of Queen Anne (August 1714)**: The death of Queen Anne, who had been a relatively sympathetic figure to the Jacobites, led to the succession of George I, the Elector of Hanover. His ascension was viewed with hostility by Jacobites, who supported the claim of James Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender), the son of the deposed King James II.\n\n3. **Political Discontent**: The political landscape in Scotland was marked by division and dissatisfaction with the new Hanoverian regime. Many Scots felt marginalized and disillusioned by the political changes that followed the Acts of Union.\n\n4. **Raising of the Jacobite Standard (August 27, 1715)**: John Erskine, the 6th Earl of Mar, a former supporter of the Revolution, took the initiative to raise the Jacobite standard at Braemar, Aberdeenshire. He aimed to rally support from the Jacobite clans and the Episcopal northeast for James III and VIII.\n\n5. **Mobilization of Support**: Following the raising of the standard, Mar gathered a significant number of supporters, including various Highland clans. This mobilization was fueled by a combination of loyalty to the Stuart cause and dissatisfaction with the current political order.\n\n6. **Initial Military Actions**: Mar's forces aimed to capture key strategic locations, including Stirling Castle. However, his leadership was characterized by hesitation and missed opportunities, which ultimately affected the momentum of the rebellion.\n\nThese events set the stage for the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, which was marked by a mix of ambition, political intrigue, and the desire to restore the Stuart dynasty to the throne of Great Britain.
