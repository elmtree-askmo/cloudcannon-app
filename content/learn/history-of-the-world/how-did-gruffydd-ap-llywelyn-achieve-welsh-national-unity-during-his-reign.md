answer: >-
    Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1010 - 5 August 1063) is a significant figure in Welsh history, known for being the first and only king to unite all of Wales under his rule from 1055 to 1063. His reign marked a pivotal moment in the historical and political evolution of Wales, as he imposed a vision of nationhood and identity that briefly established a unified Welsh kingdom.\n\nGruffydd's path to unification began with his earlier rule as King of Gwynedd and Powys from 1039 to 1055. His military prowess was evident when he defeated Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in 1055, which allowed him to gain control over Deheubarth, a crucial region in southern Wales. This victory was instrumental in consolidating his power and expanding his territory.\n\nThroughout his reign, Gruffydd pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, particularly towards the eastern borders with England. He formed alliances, notably with Aelfgar of Mercia, to challenge the Saxon and Norman forces, which culminated in successful military campaigns, including the attack on Hereford. These actions not only solidified his control over Wales but also positioned him as a formidable leader in the face of external threats.\n\nGruffydd's ability to unify Wales was also facilitated by the political landscape of the time, which was characterized by divisions among the Anglo-Saxon rulers. In 1056, he swore loyalty to King Edward the Confessor, which allowed him to negotiate peace and gain control over lands in both northern and southern Wales. This strategic maneuvering helped him maintain a semblance of stability while expanding his influence.\n\nDespite the short-lived nature of his reign, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's achievements in unifying Wales laid the groundwork for future movements towards Welsh national identity and autonomy. His legacy is remembered as a crucial chapter in the fight for Welsh independence and the preservation of Welsh culture against external domination.
