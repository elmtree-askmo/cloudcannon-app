    What role did WASPs play in maintaining racial hierarchies in the United States?
answer: >-
    White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs) played a significant role in maintaining racial hierarchies in the United States through various social, political, and cultural mechanisms. Historically, WASPs have been associated with the dominant culture and elite class, which has allowed them to exert considerable influence over societal norms and policies.\n\n1. **Cultural Dominance**: WASPs have historically dominated American society, culture, and politics. This dominance has often translated into the establishment of norms and values that favor their own group while marginalizing others. The WASP identity is closely tied to notions of American identity, which has often excluded non-WASP groups from the narrative of what it means to be "American."\n\n2. **Racial Exclusion**: The WASP community reacted with alarm to the influx of "new" immigrants from southern and eastern Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While there was some haphazard exclusion of European immigrants, WASPs systematically excluded East Asians, Mexicans, and African Americans. This selective exclusion helped to reinforce racial hierarchies, as WASPs positioned themselves as the standard of "whiteness" and American identity.\n\n3. **Legislation and Policy**: WASPs influenced immigration policies that favored their own ethnic group. For instance, the 1921 Quota Act established immigration quotas that prioritized immigrants from northern and western Europe, effectively limiting the entry of those from southern and eastern Europe, as well as non-European groups. This legislative framework helped to maintain the racial and ethnic status quo.\n\n4. **Social Structures**: The WASP community often engaged in practices that reinforced social stratification. For example, they created residential patterns that segregated themselves from other ethnic groups, contributing to the perception of "white ethnics" as socially acceptable while continuing to exclude African Americans and other minorities.\n\n5. **Racism and Prejudice**: WASPs have historically perpetuated racism and prejudice against non-WASP groups. This included derogatory portrayals of African Americans and other minorities in media and public discourse, which served to dehumanize these groups and justify their exclusion from social and economic opportunities.\n\n6. **Nativism and Xenophobia**: The rise of nativism and xenophobia in the United States can be traced back to WASP fears of losing their cultural dominance. This fear was often fueled by economic anxieties, such as job competition and economic instability, which led to scapegoating of immigrant groups.\n\nIn summary, WASPs have played a crucial role in maintaining racial hierarchies in the United States through cultural dominance, legislative influence, social segregation, and the perpetuation of racism and nativism. Their actions and attitudes have significantly shaped the landscape of American society, contributing to ongoing issues of inequality and discrimination.
