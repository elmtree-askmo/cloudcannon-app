    How has the Truth and Reconciliation Commission addressed the legacy of residential schools?
answer: >-
    The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) was established as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, with the primary goal of documenting the impact of the Indian Residential School System on survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The TRC operated from 2008 to 2015 and provided a platform for those affected by the legacy of residential schools to share their stories and experiences.\n\nIn its final report, released in 2015, the TRC outlined the history and legacy of residential schools and presented 94 Calls to Action aimed at addressing the harm caused by these institutions and advancing reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. These recommendations cover a wide range of areas, including education, health, justice, and child welfare, emphasizing the need for systemic changes to recognize and respect Indigenous rights and cultures.\n\nThe TRC's work highlighted the devastating legacy of residential schools, which included widespread neglect, abuse, and the forced removal of children from their families. The Commission's findings underscored the importance of acknowledging this painful history and the ongoing impacts of systemic racism and discrimination faced by Indigenous peoples in Canada.\n\nThe TRC's final report serves as a crucial document for understanding the historical context of colonialism in Canada and the need for meaningful reconciliation efforts. It calls for a commitment from all levels of government and society to implement its recommendations and work collaboratively with Indigenous communities to foster healing and understanding.\n\nOverall, the TRC has played a significant role in raising awareness about the legacy of residential schools and has set a framework for ongoing dialogue and action towards reconciliation in Canada.
