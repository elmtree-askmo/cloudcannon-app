    What role is India playing in peace efforts between Ukraine and other nations?
answer: >-
    India is playing a significant role in peace efforts between Ukraine and other nations, particularly through its diplomatic engagements and strategic positioning. The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy as the means to resolve the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. \n\nDuring a historic visit to Ukraine, Modi expressed India's readiness to act as a "friend" in facilitating peace talks, highlighting the necessity for discussions between the conflicting parties. This visit marked the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, underscoring India's commitment to fostering a collaborative relationship with Ukraine.\n\nIndia's unique position as a friend to both Russia and the West allows it to potentially serve as a mediator in the conflict. Experts have noted that India's balancing act is becoming increasingly complex, yet it could leverage its relationships to promote peace. The Indian government has maintained a consistent stance that emphasizes the need for diplomatic solutions, rather than taking sides in the conflict.\n\nAt international forums, such as the G7 Summit, Modi has assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that India will do "everything it can" to assist in bringing peace to Ukraine. This commitment reflects India's broader strategy of engaging with global conflicts and positioning itself as a proactive player in international diplomacy.\n\nOverall, India's approach combines a commitment to dialogue with a strategic partnership with both Ukraine and Russia, aiming to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the ongoing war while navigating its longstanding ties with Moscow.
