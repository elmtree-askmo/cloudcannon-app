    What are the key elements of India's Act East Policy?
answer: >-
    India's Act East Policy (AEP), launched in 2014, is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing India's engagement with the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Southeast Asia. This policy is an evolution of the earlier Look East Policy, which was initiated in 1991. Here are the key elements of India's Act East Policy:\n\n1. **Four Pillars**: The AEP is built on the framework of the "4 C's" - Culture, Commerce, Connectivity, and Capacity Building. This framework aims to foster deeper ties with countries in the region through cultural exchanges, economic partnerships, improved connectivity, and building capacities in various sectors.\n\n2. **SAGAR Vision**: Prime Minister Narendra Modi articulated a vision for the region encapsulated in the acronym SAGAR, which stands for "Security and Growth for All in the Region." This vision emphasizes the importance of security cooperation and mutual growth among nations in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n3. **Strategic Engagement**: The policy focuses on strengthening India's strategic and security ties with countries in the region, particularly in response to growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. Securing freedom of navigation and enhancing India's role in regional security are critical components of this strategy.\n\n4. **Economic Cooperation**: The AEP aims to boost economic ties with Southeast Asian nations, which account for a significant portion of India's foreign trade. India seeks to enhance trade relations, attract foreign investment, and participate in regional economic initiatives.\n\n5. **Cultural Diplomacy**: The policy promotes cultural exchanges and people-to-people connections to foster mutual understanding and goodwill among nations in the region. This includes initiatives in education, tourism, and cultural heritage.\n\n6. **Multilateral Engagement**: India has actively participated in regional multilateral organizations such as the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to enhance cooperation on various fronts, including environmental issues, economic development, and security.\n\n7. **Proactive Regional Positioning**: The AEP represents a shift towards a more proactive approach in India's foreign policy, aiming to position India as a key player in the emerging economic and security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOverall, India's Act East Policy reflects a comprehensive approach to strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific, addressing economic, strategic, and cultural dimensions to enhance India's influence and cooperation in the region.
