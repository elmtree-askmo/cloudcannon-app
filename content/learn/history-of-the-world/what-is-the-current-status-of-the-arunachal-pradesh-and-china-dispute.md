    What is the current status of the Arunachal Pradesh and China dispute?
answer: >-
    The current status of the Arunachal Pradesh and China dispute remains tense and complex, characterized by ongoing military and diplomatic confrontations. Here are the key developments:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Developments**: China has been enhancing its military infrastructure near the Arunachal Pradesh border, including the construction of a new dual-use airport in Lhontse Dzong, which is less than 30 miles from the McMahon Line. This has prompted India to accelerate its own infrastructure projects, with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completing 90 projects along the India-China border, including 36 in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n2. **Military Clashes**: The situation has been marked by recent skirmishes, notably a clash in December 2022 in the Tawang sector, where Chinese troops attempted to unilaterally change the status quo. This incident was described as the worst confrontation since the deadly Galwan Valley clash in 2020, which resulted in significant casualties on both sides.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Tensions**: India has lodged strong protests against China's claims over Arunachal Pradesh, particularly in response to China's new map that includes the region as part of its territory. The U.S. has also expressed support for India's claims, further complicating the geopolitical dynamics.\n\n4. **China's Claims**: China continues to assert its claim over Arunachal Pradesh, referring to it as "South Tibet." The release of China's 2023 "standard map" reiterates its territorial claims, which India vehemently disputes.\n\n5. **Strategic Importance**: The Sela Tunnel, inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is seen as a significant military asset, providing all-weather access to the Tawang region. This has drawn attention from China, which views such developments as provocative.\n\nOverall, the Arunachal Pradesh dispute is characterized by a mix of military posturing, infrastructure development, and diplomatic maneuvering, with both nations maintaining firm stances on their territorial claims. The situation remains fluid, and further developments are likely as both countries navigate this contentious issue.
