    How did Anna Smith Strong contribute to intelligence gathering during the American Revolution?
answer: >-
    Anna Smith Strong played a significant role in intelligence gathering during the American Revolution as a member of the Culper Spy Ring, which was established to provide critical information to General George Washington. Recruited by Major Benjamin Tallmadge, the spymaster for Washington, Anna was one of the few female members of this covert group.\n\nHer contributions primarily involved relaying intelligence and coordinating communications among the spies. Anna utilized her farmstead in Setauket, New York, as a base for these operations. One of the most notable methods she employed was the use of her clothesline to send signals. According to family tradition, she would hang laundry in specific patterns to indicate meeting locations for other members of the spy ring, such as Caleb Brewster, who was responsible for transporting messages and information.\n\nAnna's involvement was particularly crucial during a time when her husband, Selah Strong, was imprisoned by the British as a suspected spy. Despite the risks to her safety and that of her family, she continued to gather and relay important information, demonstrating her bravery and commitment to the Patriot cause. Her efforts were recognized post-war when George Washington reimbursed her husband for expenses related to the spy ring, further underscoring her significant contributions to the American Revolutionary effort.
