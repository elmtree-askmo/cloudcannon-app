    Why was the Stamp Act eventually repealed?
answer: >-
    The Stamp Act was eventually repealed on March 18, 1766, primarily due to the intense and widespread resistance from the American colonies. The act, which imposed a direct tax on a variety of printed materials, sparked significant protests and organized opposition, including the formation of the Stamp Act Congress, which represented nine colonies. This Congress marked a crucial moment of colonial unity and defiance against British taxation policies.\n\nThe British government, under the leadership of the Marquis of Rockingham, recognized that the resistance made it increasingly difficult to enforce the Stamp Act. The protests included boycotts of British goods, which pressured merchants and ultimately led to calls for the repeal of the tax. Rockingham's administration was persuaded to repeal the Stamp Act not out of sympathy for the colonial protests, but rather to avoid a costly and protracted conflict with the colonies.\n\nOn the same day the Stamp Act was repealed, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which asserted its authority to legislate for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." This was intended to reaffirm British control and ensure that while the Stamp Act was removed, the principle of parliamentary sovereignty over the colonies remained intact.\n\nIn summary, the repeal of the Stamp Act was a response to the effective colonial resistance and the realization by British leaders that continuing the tax could lead to greater unrest and potential conflict. The repeal was celebrated in the colonies as a significant victory, although it did not resolve the underlying tensions regarding taxation and representation.
