    How did Roosevelt's presidency influence Taft's policies?
answer: >-
    Theodore Roosevelt's presidency had a significant influence on William Howard Taft's policies, both in terms of continuity and divergence. When Taft assumed the presidency in 1909, he was seen as Roosevelt's chosen successor, and Roosevelt himself expressed confidence that Taft would carry on his policies. Roosevelt described Taft as a "strong, resourceful efficient man" who shared his principles and ideals.\n\nHowever, the reality of Taft's presidency revealed a more complex relationship. While Taft initially aimed to continue Roosevelt's progressive reforms, he faced challenges that led to a more conservative approach. For instance, Taft appointed conservatives to his cabinet and supported the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, which favored big businesses and disappointed many progressives who had supported Roosevelt's more aggressive regulatory stance. This shift in policy alienated progressive supporters and created a rift between Taft and Roosevelt.\n\nMoreover, Taft's adherence to the written law and platform pledges contrasted with Roosevelt's more dynamic and populist approach. Roosevelt was known for engaging directly with the public and adapting to their sentiments, while Taft's more legalistic style was perceived as less responsive to the evolving needs of the populace. This difference in approach contributed to the perception of Taft's presidency as a conservative interregnum between the more activist presidencies of Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.\n\nIn summary, while Taft began his presidency with the intention of continuing Roosevelt's legacy, his policies ultimately diverged, leading to disappointment among progressives and a significant political split within the Republican Party. This divergence set the stage for the 1912 election, where Roosevelt would run against Taft, further highlighting the impact of Roosevelt's presidency on Taft's policies and the broader political landscape of the time.
