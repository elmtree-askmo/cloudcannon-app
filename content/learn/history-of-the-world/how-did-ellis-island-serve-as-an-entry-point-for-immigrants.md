    How did Ellis Island serve as an entry point for immigrants?
answer: >-
    Ellis Island served as a crucial entry point for immigrants to the United States from 1892 to 1954, processing over 12 million individuals during this period. Located in New York Harbor, it became the largest and most active immigration station in America, particularly between 1900 and 1914, when it reached its peak operation, handling up to 5,000 immigrants daily.\n\nUpon arrival, immigrants typically disembarked from steamships at nearby piers and boarded ferries to Ellis Island. The immigration process began as they ascended the steep stairs into the Great Hall, known as the Registry Room. Here, they underwent a series of inspections, including medical examinations to check for diseases and assessments of their documentation to ensure they met U.S. immigration laws. Most immigrants were processed within three to five hours, allowing them to quickly begin their new lives in America. However, for some, the experience was less favorable, leading to family separations and denials of entry, which earned Ellis Island the nickname "Island of Tears."\n\nThe facility was designed to ensure that only those who were healthy, of good character, and financially stable could enter the country. Steamship companies played a significant role in this process, as they were incentivized to screen passengers thoroughly; failure to do so could result in fines and the obligation to return rejected immigrants.\n\nEllis Island's historical significance lies not only in its role as a gateway for millions seeking a better life but also in its representation of the complexities of immigration, including the challenges and regulations that shaped the experiences of those who passed through its gates. The island was officially closed as an immigration station in 1954, but it remains a powerful symbol of the immigrant experience in the United States. Today, it is home to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, which preserves and shares this important aspect of American history.
