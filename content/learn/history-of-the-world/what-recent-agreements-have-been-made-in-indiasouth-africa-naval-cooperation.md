    What recent agreements have been made in India-South Africa naval cooperation?
answer: >-
    Recent agreements in India-South Africa naval cooperation include a significant implementation agreement signed on September 4, 2024, aimed at enhancing submarine rescue support cooperation. This agreement ensures the safety of the South African Navy's submarine crew during times of distress or accidents, reinforcing a shared commitment to maritime safety and mutual support between the two nations.\n\nThe agreement allows the Indian Navy to deploy its Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) to assist the South African Navy in emergencies. This development comes in the wake of a tragic incident in September 2023, where three South African navy members lost their lives during a submarine accident involving the SAS Manthatisi, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety measures.\n\nAdditionally, the 12th edition of the India-South Africa Navy Staff Talks, held in New Delhi from August 27 to 28, 2024, further solidified the collaboration between the two naval forces, emphasizing their mutual commitment to strengthening maritime security and operational capabilities in the Indian Ocean Region.
