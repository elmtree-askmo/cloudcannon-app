    What were the reasons behind Joe Biden's withdrawal from the U.S. Presidential Race?
answer: >-
    Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 U.S. presidential race on July 21, 2024, primarily due to concerns that the intraparty battle over his candidacy would serve as a "real distraction" for the Democratic Party. This decision came after significant pressure from Democratic Party officials and media commentators, particularly following a disappointing performance in the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. \n\nBiden's exit from the race was marked by a sense of urgency as he faced mounting calls from party members, including U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett and U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, to step aside. Ultimately, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, who then received the Democratic nomination. However, Harris went on to lose the election to former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's decision to withdraw was also influenced by concerns regarding his age and the perception of his ability to effectively challenge Trump in the election. This marked a significant moment in Biden's political career, concluding a five-decade-long journey in politics.
