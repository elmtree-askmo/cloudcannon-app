answer: >-
    The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting, specifically the 23rd Summit of the SCO Council of Heads of State, took place virtually on July 4, 2023, and was chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Key participants included leaders from all SCO member states, which are China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran. \n\nDuring this summit, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar represented India and engaged in discussions with his Pakistani counterpart, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding issues of cross-border terrorism, with both nations taking veiled swipes at each other during the discussions.\n\nThe SCO serves as a platform for these countries to address regional security concerns and foster cooperation, although the dynamics between India and Pakistan remain complex and often contentious.
