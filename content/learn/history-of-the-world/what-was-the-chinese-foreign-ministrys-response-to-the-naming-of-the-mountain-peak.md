    What was the Chinese Foreign Ministry's response to the naming of the mountain peak?
answer: >-
    The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded strongly to the naming of a mountain peak in Arunachal Pradesh by a group of Indian mountaineers after the sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso. The spokesperson, Lin Jian, stated that the act was "illegal, and null and void for India," reiterating China's longstanding territorial claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which it refers to as Zangnan. This response reflects China's ongoing discontent regarding India's administrative actions in the region, as it claims approximately 90,000 square kilometers of Arunachal Pradesh as its territory. The Chinese government expressed its displeasure during a media briefing, emphasizing that India has no legal standing to designate names or establish governance in what it considers Chinese territory.
