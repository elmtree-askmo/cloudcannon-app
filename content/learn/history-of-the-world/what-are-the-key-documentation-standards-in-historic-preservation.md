    What are the key documentation standards in historic preservation?
answer: >-
    The key documentation standards in historic preservation are primarily guided by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architectural and Engineering Documentation. These standards apply to the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER), and the Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS), which are the national programs for documenting historical architecture, engineering, and landscapes under the National Park Service.\n\nHere are the main components of these documentation standards:\n\n1. **Measured Drawings**: Documentation must include accurate measured drawings that depict the significant features of the historic property. These drawings should be created according to established guidelines to ensure consistency and quality.\n\n2. **Large-Format Photographs**: High-quality photographs are essential for capturing the visual aspects of the property. These images should be taken using large-format cameras to provide detailed representations of the structure or landscape.\n\n3. **Written Data**: Comprehensive written reports are required to contextualize the visual documentation. These reports should detail the historical, architectural, technological, or cultural significance of the property being documented.\n\n4. **Quality and Format Standards**: The documentation must adhere to specific standards for quality, content, format, and durability. This ensures that the records are preserved for future generations and can be consulted by historians, researchers, and preservationists.\n\n5. **Field Investigation Techniques**: Guidelines for field investigations include methods for observing, measuring, and recording data about historic sites. This includes creating field notes and short-form reports that conform to HABS standards.\n\n6. **Mitigation Documentation**: In cases where historic properties are at risk of being adversely affected, such as through demolition, documentation must meet HABS/HAER/HALS standards to ensure that valuable information is preserved.\n\n7. **Public Accessibility**: The results of historic documentation should be made available for use in preservation planning and by the general public, promoting transparency and education regarding historic properties.\n\nThese standards are designed to ensure that documentation is thorough, accurate, and useful for a variety of stakeholders involved in historic preservation.
