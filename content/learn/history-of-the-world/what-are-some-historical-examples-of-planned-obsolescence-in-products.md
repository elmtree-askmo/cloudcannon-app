answer: >-
    Planned obsolescence (PO) is a strategy used by manufacturers to design products with a limited useful life, encouraging consumers to purchase replacements more frequently. Here are some historical examples of planned obsolescence:\n\n1. **The Phoebus Cartel (1924)**: One of the earliest and most notable examples of planned obsolescence occurred with the formation of the Phoebus cartel, which included major light bulb manufacturers such as Philips, Osram, and General Electric. The cartel agreed to limit the lifespan of light bulbs to around 1,000 hours, significantly shorter than the potential lifespan of the technology at the time. This decision was made to increase sales by ensuring that consumers would need to replace their bulbs more often.\n\n2. **Automotive Industry Competition (Early 20th Century)**: The rivalry between automobile manufacturers, particularly Ford and General Motors, also exemplifies planned obsolescence. In the 1920s, General Motors introduced the concept of annual model changes, which encouraged consumers to buy new cars more frequently. This strategy was aimed at creating a perception of obsolescence, as new models featured updated designs and features, making older models seem outdated.\n\n3. **Inkjet Printers**: A more contemporary example can be seen in the design of inkjet printers. Many models are equipped with smart chips that track the number of pages printed or the duration of use. Once a predetermined limit is reached, the printer may stop functioning, even if there is still ink available. This forces consumers to either purchase a new printer or pay for repairs, thus exemplifying planned obsolescence in modern technology.\n\nThese examples illustrate how planned obsolescence has been utilized across different industries to drive consumer behavior and increase sales, often at the expense of sustainability and resource efficiency.
