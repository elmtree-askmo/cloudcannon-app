    What is Operation Sarvashakti and its objectives?
answer: >-
    Operation Sarvashakti is a strategic military initiative launched by the Indian Army aimed at combating terrorism in the Rajouri and Poonch regions of Jammu and Kashmir. The operation is a response to a series of ambushes on Indian troops in these areas, which have been attributed to terrorist groups, particularly those supported by Pakistani proxies.\n\n### Objectives of Operation Sarvashakti:\n1. **Elimination of Terrorists**: The primary goal is to locate and eliminate terrorists who are believed to be hiding in the dense jungles, mountains, and caves of the region. This is particularly crucial as these terrorists have been involved in ambushes against Indian security forces.\n   \n2. **Increased Troop Deployment**: The operation involves the deployment of additional troops from at least three brigades, enhancing the density of military presence in the area. This is intended to create a more robust operational environment to counter terrorist activities effectively.\n\n3. **Simultaneous Operations**: The Chinar Corps based in Srinagar and the White Knight Corps in Nagrota are conducting simultaneous operations as part of this initiative, ensuring a coordinated approach to tackling the threat.\n\n4. **Strategic Coordination**: The operation is being executed in close coordination with various security agencies, including the Jammu and Kashmir Police, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and the Special Operations Group. This collaboration aims to enhance intelligence gathering and operational effectiveness.\n\n5. **Focus on Historical Context**: Operation Sarvashakti draws parallels with previous military operations, such as Operation Sarp Vinash, which was conducted over two decades ago in the same region. This historical context underscores the ongoing challenges posed by terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n### Context:\nThe operation is particularly significant given the recent escalation of terrorist activities in the region, which have resulted in the deaths of several Indian soldiers. The presence of foreign terrorists in the area further complicates the security landscape, making Operation Sarvashakti a critical component of India's counter-terrorism strategy in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn summary, Operation Sarvashakti represents a comprehensive military effort to address the persistent threat of terrorism in the Rajouri-Poonch sector, with a focus on eliminating terrorist hideouts and enhancing security through increased troop presence and strategic coordination among various security forces.
