    What is the historical context of the Indus Waters Treaty?
answer: >-
    The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) is a significant water-distribution agreement signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan, with the World Bank acting as a mediator. The treaty emerged from the historical context of the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, which created tensions over the shared water resources of the Indus River system.\n\nNegotiations for the treaty began in 1951 and lasted for nine years, culminating in an agreement that allocates the waters of the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. Under the terms of the treaty, Pakistan has control over approximately 70% of the water, specifically from the Western Rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab), while India retains rights to the Eastern Rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej), which account for about 30% of the total water flow.\n\nThe IWT is notable for being one of the most successful international treaties, having been upheld and implemented faithfully by both nations despite periods of political tension and conflict. It has played a crucial role in maintaining water cooperation between India and Pakistan for over six decades, making it the only cross-border water-sharing treaty in Asia.\n\nThe treaty's origins can be traced back to the efforts of former World Bank President Eugene Black, who facilitated the negotiations. The Indus River system, which begins in Tibet and flows through the disputed Kashmir region before reaching the Arabian Sea, is vital for the agricultural and economic needs of both countries, further underscoring the importance of the treaty in regional stability and cooperation.
