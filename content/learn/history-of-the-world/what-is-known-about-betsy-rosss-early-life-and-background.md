    What is known about Betsy Ross's early life and background?
answer: >-
    Betsy Ross, born Elizabeth Griscom on January 1, 1752, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a prominent figure in American history, best known for her association with the creation of the first American flag. She was the eighth of seventeen children in a Quaker family, with her parents being Samuel Griscom and Rebecca James Griscom. Her family background was rooted in the Quaker tradition, which emphasized simplicity and craftsmanship.\n\nBetsy learned to sew from her great aunt, Sarah Elizabeth Ann Griscom, and after receiving an education at a Quaker-run school, she was apprenticed to an upholsterer named William Webster. This apprenticeship provided her with the skills that would later contribute to her role as a flag maker during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAt the age of 21, Betsy eloped with John Ross, a fellow apprentice, which led to her expulsion from the Quaker church due to the defiance of their strict codes. The couple married in 1773, but their marriage was short-lived as John Ross died in 1776. During her early adult life, Betsy continued to work in the upholstery business, where she not only made flags but also repaired uniforms and created various military supplies for the Continental Army.\n\nBetsy Ross's legacy as a patriotic icon began to take shape in the late 19th century, particularly around the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations. Although the historical accuracy of her making the first U.S. flag is debated, her story has become an integral part of American folklore, symbolizing women's contributions to the nation's history.
