    What contributions did Hecataeus of Miletus and Herodotus make to the early mentions of Celts?
answer: >-
    Hecataeus of Miletus and Herodotus made significant contributions to the early mentions of the Celts through their respective works, which are among the earliest sources documenting the existence and characteristics of these peoples.\n\n### Hecataeus of Miletus\nHecataeus, active in the late 6th to early 5th century BC, is known for his work 'Periegesis,' which provided a geographical description of the known world. In this work, he included ethnographic accounts of various peoples, including the Celts, referred to as "Keltoi" (Greek: Κελτοί). His writings represent some of the earliest systematic attempts to document and categorize different cultures, contributing to the field of ethnography. Although much of Hecataeus's work survives only in fragments cited by later authors, his observations laid the groundwork for understanding the Celts in the context of their geographical and cultural environment.\n\n### Herodotus\nHerodotus, often called the 'Father of History,' lived in the 5th century BC and authored 'Histories,' a comprehensive account of the Greco-Persian Wars. In this work, he provided descriptions of various peoples, including the Celts. Herodotus's approach combined historical narrative with ethnographic observations, offering insights into the customs, beliefs, and social structures of different cultures. His accounts are crucial for understanding the historical context of the Celts, detailing their interactions with other civilizations and providing a glimpse into their societal characteristics.\n\n### Summary\nBoth Hecataeus and Herodotus played pivotal roles in the early documentation of the Celts, with Hecataeus focusing on geographical and ethnographic descriptions and Herodotus providing a broader historical narrative that included the Celts among other peoples. Their works are invaluable for modern scholars seeking to understand the early perceptions of Celtic society and culture.
