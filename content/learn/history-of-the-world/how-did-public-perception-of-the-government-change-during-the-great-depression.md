    How did public perception of the government change during the Great Depression?
answer: >-
    During the Great Depression, public perception of the government underwent significant changes, primarily driven by the economic hardships faced by millions of Americans. Initially, many Americans held a belief in limited government intervention, a sentiment that was largely shaped by President Herbert Hoover's philosophy of "rugged individualism." Hoover's approach emphasized voluntary action and minimal government involvement, which proved inadequate in addressing the widespread suffering caused by the economic crisis. His failure to effectively respond to the needs of the populace led to growing discontent and a perception that the government was not fulfilling its role in times of crisis.\n\nAs the Depression deepened, public opinion shifted dramatically. Americans began to expect more from their government, seeking active intervention to alleviate their suffering. This shift was particularly evident with the introduction of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, which marked a significant expansion of the federal government's role in economic and social issues. The New Deal created a new expectation among the public that the government would take responsibility for economic stability and provide support for those in need. This transformation in public perception was characterized by a desire for increased government involvement in the economy and a belief that the government should play a crucial role in ensuring the welfare of its citizens.\n\nThe Great Depression also highlighted the precariousness of life for many individuals, leading to a broader recognition of the risks inherent in economic systems. As a result, the government was increasingly viewed as an essential entity for managing and mitigating disasters, a perspective that has had lasting implications for American political attitudes. The era fostered a belief that government intervention was necessary not only during crises but also as a regular part of economic management.\n\nIn summary, the Great Depression catalyzed a significant shift in public perception of the government, moving from a preference for limited intervention to an expectation of active government involvement in economic and social welfare. This change laid the groundwork for future government policies and the evolving relationship between the American public and their government.
