    What is the significance of National Flag Day in India?
answer: >-
    National Flag Day in India is observed annually on July 22 to commemorate the adoption of the Indian national flag by the Constituent Assembly in 1947. This significant occasion marks a pivotal moment in India's history, occurring just weeks before the country gained independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947.\n\nThe day serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Historical Significance**: National Flag Day honors the rich history and the relentless struggle for independence. The adoption of the flag symbolizes the aspirations of the Indian people for freedom, unity, and sovereignty.\n\n2. **Symbol of Unity**: The national flag, known as the Tiraṅgā (the tricolour), consists of three horizontal stripes of deep saffron, white, and green, with a navy blue Ashoka Chakra (a 24-spoke wheel) at its center. It embodies the spirit of the nation, representing diversity and togetherness among the Indian populace.\n\n3. **Fostering Patriotism**: The day encourages citizens to reflect on the values represented by the flag and to foster a sense of patriotism and national unity. It serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless individuals in the struggle for independence.\n\n4. **Regulatory Framework**: The use and display of the national flag are governed by the Flag Code of India, which outlines the proper etiquette and respect that should be afforded to the flag.\n\nIn summary, National Flag Day is not only a celebration of a historical achievement but also a day to reflect on the ideals of freedom, unity, and pride that the Indian national flag represents.
