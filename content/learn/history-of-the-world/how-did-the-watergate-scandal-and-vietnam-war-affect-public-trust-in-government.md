    How did the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War affect public trust in government?
answer: >-
    The Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War significantly eroded public trust in the U.S. government during the late 20th century. \n\nThe Vietnam War, which escalated in the 1960s, shattered many Americans' illusions about their government. Initially, there was a strong belief in the government's integrity and its decisions regarding foreign policy. However, as the war progressed, revelations such as the Pentagon Papers exposed the discrepancies between the government's public statements and the reality of the situation on the ground. This led to widespread disillusionment, as many Americans felt misled about the war's purpose and the human cost involved. Trust in government dropped dramatically during this period, and it has not returned to pre-Vietnam levels since then.\n\nSimilarly, the Watergate scandal, which unfolded in the early 1970s, further compounded this decline in trust. The scandal involved a series of illegal activities by members of President Nixon's administration, including the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and subsequent cover-up efforts. The public's reaction to these events was one of outrage and betrayal, culminating in Nixon's resignation in 1974. The scandal not only diminished trust in Nixon but also in the federal government as a whole, leading to a significant decline in confidence in public officials and institutions.\n\nBoth events marked a turning point in American political culture, ushering in an era characterized by skepticism towards government. The combination of the Vietnam War's revelations and the Watergate scandal created a lasting impact on public perception, resulting in a persistent low level of trust in government that has continued into the 21st century.
