    What actions and demands were made by the Métis during the first uprising in 1869?
answer: >-
    During the first uprising in 1869, known as the Red River Rebellion or Red River Resistance, the Métis took several significant actions and made specific demands in response to the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada. This transfer raised concerns among the Métis about the preservation of their culture, land rights, and way of life under Canadian governance.\n\n1. **Formation of a Provisional Government**: Led by Louis Riel, the Métis established a provisional government in late 1869. This was a crucial step in organizing their resistance and asserting their rights in the face of the impending Canadian control.\n\n2. **Occupation of Key Locations**: The Métis took control of Upper Fort Garry, a strategic location in the Red River Colony, which allowed them to consolidate their authority and military presence in the area. This occupation was a direct challenge to the Canadian government's authority.\n\n3. **List of Demands**: The Métis presented a list of demands to the Canadian government, which included:\n   - Recognition of their land rights and the protection of their culture.\n   - The establishment of a land grant system that would ensure Métis ownership of their lands.\n   - The creation of a bilingual government to reflect the French and English-speaking populations in the region.\n   - The inclusion of Métis rights in the terms of Manitoba's entry into Confederation.\n\n4. **Negotiations Leading to the Manitoba Act**: The actions of the Métis and their demands ultimately led to negotiations with the Canadian government, resulting in the Manitoba Act of 1870. This act addressed several of their concerns, including the creation of the province of Manitoba and provisions for land rights.\n\nThe Red River Rebellion was a pivotal moment in Canadian history, highlighting the struggles of the Métis and their fight for recognition and rights within the new Canadian framework.
