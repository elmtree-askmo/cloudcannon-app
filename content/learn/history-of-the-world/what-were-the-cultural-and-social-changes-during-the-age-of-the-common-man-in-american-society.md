answer: >-
    During the Age of the Common Man, also known as the Jacksonian Era (1824-1845), American society experienced significant cultural and social changes that reshaped the political landscape and the role of the individual within it. Here are some key aspects of these changes:\n\n1. **Expansion of Democracy**: One of the most notable changes was the extension of voting rights to nearly all white men, regardless of land ownership. By the late 1820s, almost all adult white males had gained the right to vote, which marked a significant shift from previous practices where voting was largely restricted to property owners. This democratization of the electoral process allowed for greater political participation and representation of the "common man."\n\n2. **Rise of the Common Man**: The cultural narrative during this period glorified the image of the "common man," emphasizing self-reliance and the idea that anyone could achieve success through hard work. Andrew Jackson's humble origins and rise to the presidency served as a powerful symbol of this belief. The notion of the self-made man became a central theme in American identity, promoting the idea that social mobility was attainable.\n\n3. **Political Participation and Workers' Rights**: The era saw a growing emphasis on the rights of workers and the importance of their participation in the political process. The rise of labor movements and advocacy for workers' rights reflected the changing attitudes towards economic and social justice. Jackson's opposition to central banks, which he believed favored the wealthy, resonated with the common man and reinforced the idea of a government that should serve the interests of the majority.\n\n4. **Social Equality and Class Distinctions**: The Age of the Common Man also witnessed a blurring of class distinctions in certain social settings. For example, it became common for men and women to eat together, and there was less visible differentiation among social classes in public transportation, such as steamboats and railroad cars. This shift indicated a growing sense of equality among white males, although it did not extend to women or people of color.\n\n5. **Cultural Narratives and Literature**: The period also saw the emergence of literature and cultural narratives that celebrated the common man. Publications like Godey's Lady's Book began to reflect and shape societal values, promoting the idea of a more inclusive society. The cultural output of the time often highlighted themes of democracy, individualism, and the virtues of the common citizen.\n\n6. **Contrasting Perspectives**: While the Age of the Common Man is often viewed positively, it is essential to recognize the contrasting perspectives on Andrew Jackson's presidency. Some critics argued that his style of governance was undemocratic and that he exercised power in a way that undermined the very principles he purported to support. This duality reflects the complexities of the era and the ongoing debates about democracy and representation.\n\nIn summary, the Age of the Common Man was characterized by significant cultural and social changes that promoted the ideals of democracy, self-reliance, and the importance of the individual in American society. These changes laid the groundwork for future movements toward greater equality and representation, even as they highlighted the limitations of who was included in the narrative of the "common man."
