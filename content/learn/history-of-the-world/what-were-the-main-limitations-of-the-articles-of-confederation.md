    What were the main limitations of the Articles of Confederation?
answer: >-
    The Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States from 1781 until 1789, had several significant limitations that ultimately led to its replacement by the U.S. Constitution. Here are the main weaknesses:\n\n1. **Weak Central Government**: The Articles established a very limited central government, which lacked the authority to enforce laws or regulate commerce effectively. This weakness made it difficult for the national government to respond to various challenges, including economic instability and interstate disputes.\n\n2. **Inability to Levy Taxes**: One of the most critical limitations was that the Articles did not grant Congress the power to levy taxes. The central government relied on voluntary contributions from the states, which were often insufficient to meet financial needs, particularly in times of war or economic crisis.\n\n3. **No Executive Branch**: The Articles did not create an executive branch to enforce laws or manage the day-to-day operations of the government. This absence meant that there was no centralized leadership to guide the nation or implement policies effectively.\n\n4. **No National Judiciary**: There was no national court system established under the Articles, which meant that there was no mechanism for resolving disputes between states or interpreting laws. This lack of a judicial branch contributed to conflicts and inconsistencies in how laws were applied across different states.\n\n5. **Difficult Amendment Process**: Amending the Articles required unanimous consent from all thirteen states, making it nearly impossible to adapt the government to changing circumstances or to address its inherent weaknesses.\n\n6. **Trade and Economic Issues**: The Articles did not grant the federal government the power to regulate interstate or international trade, leading to economic disarray. States often imposed tariffs on each other, which hindered economic cooperation and growth.\n\n7. **Lack of Military Authority**: The central government could not maintain a standing army or navy, relying instead on state militias for defense. This limitation became particularly evident during events like Shay's Rebellion, which highlighted the inability of the federal government to maintain order.\n\nThese limitations ultimately demonstrated the need for a stronger federal government, leading to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where the current U.S. Constitution was drafted to address these issues and create a more balanced system of governance.
