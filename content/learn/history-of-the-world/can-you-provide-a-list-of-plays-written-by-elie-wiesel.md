answer: >-
    Elie Wiesel is primarily known for his powerful writings on the Holocaust, including his memoir "Night." In addition to his novels and essays, he also wrote plays. The most notable play by Elie Wiesel is:\n\n- **The Trial of God** (originally titled "Le procÃ¨s de Shamgorod") - This play, first published in English in 1979, is set in a fictional Ukrainian village in 1649, where a Cossack pogrom has devastated the Jewish community. The play revolves around a trial in which God is put on trial for the suffering of the Jewish people, exploring themes of faith, doubt, and the moral dilemmas faced during times of extreme adversity.\n\nThis play is significant as it reflects Wiesel's ongoing exploration of the themes of dehumanization, faith, and the responsibility to remember and act against injustice, which are prevalent throughout his body of work. \n\nIf you are looking for more plays or specific details about Wiesel's theatrical works, the gathered information indicates that "The Trial of God" is the primary play attributed to him. Other works mentioned in the gathered information do not specifically categorize as plays.
