    To whom did Rizal dedicate Noli Me Tangere and what was his purpose?
answer: >-
    JosÃ© Rizal dedicated his novel "Noli Me Tangere" to the Filipino people, specifically addressing it to "the youth of the Philippines." In the dedication, he expresses a deep concern for the state of his homeland, which he likens to a cancer that must be confronted and treated. The title "Noli Me Tangere," which translates to "Touch Me Not," symbolizes the painful and sensitive nature of the issues he addresses in the novel, reflecting the societal injustices and the oppressive conditions under Spanish colonial rule.\n\nRizal's purpose in writing "Noli Me Tangere" was to awaken the national consciousness of Filipinos and to inspire them to seek reform and justice. He aimed to expose the corruption and brutality of the Spanish authorities and the Catholic Church, highlighting the inequities faced by the Filipino people. Through the narrative, he sought to encourage his fellow countrymen to reflect on their situation and to strive for a better future, ultimately advocating for social change and national identity. The novel serves as both a critique of colonialism and a call to action for the Filipino populace.
