    Why did Germany invade Belgium and what were the consequences?
answer: >-
    Germany invaded Belgium on August 4, 1914, as part of its military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan. This plan aimed to quickly defeat France by launching a rapid invasion through Belgium, a neutral country, to outflank French defenses and capture Paris before turning to face Russia, which was expected to mobilize more slowly. The choice of Belgium was strategic, as it provided a direct route into northern France.\n\nThe consequences of this invasion were significant and far-reaching:\n\n1. **Violation of Neutrality**: The invasion of Belgium was a clear violation of international law and the Treaty of London (1839), which guaranteed Belgium's neutrality. This act of aggression shocked the international community and led to widespread condemnation.\n\n2. **British Involvement**: The violation of Belgian neutrality prompted Britain to enter the war. Britain had a legal obligation to protect Belgium, and public outrage over the invasion galvanized support for the war effort. The British government declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, just hours after the invasion began.\n\n3. **Atrocities and Propaganda**: The German military's actions in Belgium included numerous atrocities against civilians, which were widely reported and used as propaganda by the Allies to rally support for the war. The British press, in particular, highlighted these events to draw public sympathy and support for the war against Germany.\n\n4. **Military Occupation**: Following the invasion, most of Belgium was occupied by German forces, leading to significant suffering for the Belgian population. The Belgian government fled to France, and King Albert I remained with his troops to continue the fight against the occupiers.\n\n5. **Impact on Warfare**: The invasion of Belgium and the subsequent military operations marked the beginning of trench warfare on the Western Front. The initial rapid advances were soon met with fierce resistance, leading to a stalemate that characterized much of World War I.\n\nIn summary, Germany's invasion of Belgium was a pivotal moment that not only escalated the conflict into a full-scale war involving multiple nations but also set the stage for the brutal and protracted nature of World War I.
