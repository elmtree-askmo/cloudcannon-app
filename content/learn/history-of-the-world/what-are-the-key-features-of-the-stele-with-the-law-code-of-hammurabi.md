answer: >-
    The Stele with the Law Code of Hammurabi, created around 1754 BCE during the reign of King Hammurabi of Babylon, is a significant artifact in the study of ancient Near Eastern law and art. Here are the key features of this monumental stele:\n\n1. **Physical Characteristics**: The stele stands approximately 7.4 feet (2.25 meters) tall and is made of diorite, a durable stone that has allowed it to be well-preserved over the millennia.\n\n2. **Artistic Representation**: At the top of the stele, there is a bas-relief image depicting Hammurabi receiving the laws from Shamash, the Mesopotamian sun god and deity of justice. In this scene, Hammurabi is shown standing before Shamash, who is seated and extends a rod and a ring to him, symbolizing authority and the divine endorsement of the laws.\n\n3. **Content of the Code**: The stele inscribes a total of 282 laws that cover various aspects of Babylonian life, including trade, family, labor, and property rights. The laws are presented in a structured format, often taking the form of conditional statements, which reflect the complexity and organization of Babylonian society.\n\n4. **Legal Significance**: The Code of Hammurabi is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length and is considered the most complete and best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. It provides insight into the legal practices and societal norms of the time, including the principle of retributive justice, famously summarized by the phrase "an eye for an eye."\n\n5. **Cultural Context**: The stele was set up in the temple of Marduk, the national god of Babylonia, emphasizing the connection between law, governance, and divine authority. It serves not only as a legal document but also as a testament to Hammurabi's power and his role as a just ruler.\n\n6. **Historical Impact**: Since its discovery and decipherment in the early 20th century, the Law Code of Hammurabi has been a crucial source for understanding ancient legal systems and has drawn comparisons with other legal codes, such as the Mosaic Torah and the Roman Twelve Tables.\n\nOverall, the Stele with the Law Code of Hammurabi is a remarkable blend of art and law, encapsulating the values and governance of ancient Mesopotamian society.
