    What is the theme of the 'Vending to Justice' exhibit?
answer: >-
    The theme of the "Vending to Justice" exhibit revolves around the long history of civil rights, extending beyond the well-known events of the 1960s. It aims to explore the ongoing struggles and activism related to civil rights, particularly in the context of contemporary issues and events, such as the aftermath of the Mother Emanuel church shooting and various uprisings. The exhibit incorporates interviews with individuals involved in activism and features personal reflections, such as note cards, to provide a deeper understanding of the civil rights movement's evolution and its impact on society.\n\nThis exhibit not only highlights historical events but also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and activism in the fight for justice, making it a significant contribution to the understanding of African American history and cultural heritage preservation.
