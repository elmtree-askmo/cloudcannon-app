    What factors led to the extinction of the dodo?
answer: >-
    The extinction of the dodo bird (Raphus cucullatus) is a poignant example of how human activities can lead to the rapid demise of a species, particularly those that evolved in isolated environments without significant natural threats. Several interrelated factors contributed to the dodo's extinction:\n\n1. **Overhunting**: The dodo was hunted extensively by humans, particularly after the Dutch sailors first encountered the bird in 1598. The dodo's lack of fear of humans, combined with its inability to fly, made it an easy target for hunters. The establishment of permanent settlements in Mauritius in 1638 accelerated this hunting pressure, leading to a dramatic decline in dodo populations.\n\n2. **Habitat Destruction**: Human activities, such as logging and land clearing for agriculture, resulted in significant habitat loss for the dodo. The destruction of coastal forests, which were crucial for the dodo's nesting and foraging, further diminished its chances of survival.\n\n3. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species by humans, including rats, pigs, and dogs, had a devastating impact on the dodo. These invasive species competed for food resources and preyed on dodo eggs and chicks, further contributing to the bird's decline.\n\n4. **Limited Reproductive Capacity**: The dodo had a relatively low reproductive rate, which made it difficult for the population to recover from the pressures of hunting and habitat loss. This limited capacity for population growth compounded the effects of the other factors leading to its extinction.\n\nThe last confirmed sighting of the dodo occurred in 1662, just 24 years after the establishment of a permanent human settlement on the island. By the late 17th century, the dodo was extinct, serving as a stark reminder of the fragility of island ecosystems and the profound impact that human actions can have on biodiversity. The extinction of the dodo also had ecological consequences, as it played a crucial role in the seed dispersal of several plant species on Mauritius, including the tambalacoque tree, which may have experienced regeneration issues following the dodo's demise.
