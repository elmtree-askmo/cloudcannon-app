    How has the naming of a mountain peak in Arunachal Pradesh affected the dispute with China?
answer: >-
    The naming of a mountain peak in Arunachal Pradesh after the sixth Dalai Lama has significantly impacted the ongoing territorial dispute between India and China. Following the successful ascent of the previously unclimbed peak by an Indian mountaineering team, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted strongly, declaring the act "illegal" and asserting that it was "null and void" for India to establish the so-called "Arunachal Pradesh" in what China claims as its territory, referred to as Zangnan.\n\nChina's objection is rooted in its longstanding territorial claims over Arunachal Pradesh, which it considers part of southern Tibet. The naming of the peak is seen by China as a provocative act that reinforces India's claims to the region, further complicating the already tense relations between the two nations. The Chinese government has consistently maintained its position on Arunachal Pradesh, and this incident is part of a broader pattern where China has been renaming places in the region since 2017 to assert its claims.\n\nIn response, India has firmly rejected China's assertions, emphasizing that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has stated that attempts by China to assign "invented" names to places in Arunachal Pradesh will not change the reality of India's sovereignty over the region.\n\nOverall, the naming of the mountain peak has not only reignited tensions but also highlighted the complexities of the India-China border dispute, illustrating how cultural and historical references can become focal points in international relations.
