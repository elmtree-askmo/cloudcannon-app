    What are the details of the peace agreement in Tripura?
answer: >-
    The 2024 Tripura Peace Accord, signed on September 4, 2024, represents a significant milestone in the efforts to end the long-standing insurgency in Tripura, India. This peace agreement was reached between the Government of India, the Government of Tripura, and two major insurgent groups: the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF). The accord aims to resolve a conflict that has persisted for 35 years, marking a commitment to renounce violence and promote peaceful democratic processes.\n\nKey details of the peace agreement include:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The NLFT and ATTF have been involved in armed struggles since the 1990s, with the ATTF specifically demanding the removal of illegal migrants from electoral rolls and the full implementation of the 'Tripura Merger Agreement' of 1949.\n\n2. **Government Commitment**: The agreement is part of a broader initiative by the Indian government, particularly under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to foster peace and development in the Northeast region. This is the 12th peace accord signed in the Northeast since Modi took office, and the third specifically for Tripura.\n\n3. **Integration of Insurgents**: The accord facilitates the integration of former insurgents into mainstream society, with over 10,000 insurgents across the Northeast having laid down their arms as a result of similar peace agreements. This integration is seen as crucial for restoring peace and stability in the region.\n\n4. **Official Presence**: The signing ceremony was attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister of Tripura Prof. (Dr.) Manik Saha, and senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, highlighting the importance of the agreement at both state and national levels.\n\n5. **Future Prospects**: The agreement is viewed as a step towards breaking the cycle of violence in Tripura and fostering a safer environment for development, with a commitment to all-round development in the region.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Tripura Peace Accord is a landmark agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict and promoting a peaceful and prosperous future for the state of Tripura.
