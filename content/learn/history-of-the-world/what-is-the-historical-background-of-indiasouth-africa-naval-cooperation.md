    What is the historical background of India-South Africa naval cooperation?
answer: >-
    The historical background of India-South Africa naval cooperation is rooted in a long-standing relationship that dates back to the early 20th century, particularly during Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha movement in South Africa. This movement marked the beginning of India's engagement with South Africa, which has evolved over the years into a strategic partnership.\n\nIn March 1997, India and South Africa formalized their relationship by establishing a strategic partnership, which has since included various areas of cooperation, including defense. A significant milestone in this naval cooperation was the signing of a memorandum of understanding on defense equipment during South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's visit to India in December 1996. This laid the groundwork for future collaborations.\n\nThe naval relationship has been further strengthened through joint exercises and operational support. For instance, Indian Naval Ships regularly make port calls to South Africa, and the South African Navy has participated in exercises such as the IBSA Maritime Exercise (IBSAMAR). In March 2022, the South African Navy took part in the MILAN exercise held in India, showcasing the growing military ties between the two nations.\n\nA key development in recent years is the agreement on submarine rescue support, signed in September 2024, which allows the Indian Navy to deploy its Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) to assist the South African Navy during emergencies. This agreement is particularly significant given that South Africa is one of the few African countries with a submarine fleet, highlighting the importance of collaboration in ensuring maritime safety.\n\nOverall, the India-South Africa naval cooperation serves as a model for broader maritime collaboration across Africa, driven by shared security challenges and a commitment to mutual support. The partnership reflects India's broader strategy of enhancing defense ties with African nations, guided by principles such as "Security and Growth for All" (SAGAR) and the philosophy of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam," which emphasizes global unity.
