question: >-
    Are there any illustrated works by Elie Wiesel?
answer: >-
    Yes, Elie Wiesel has been associated with illustrated works, particularly through collaborations with illustrator Mark Podwal. One notable example is Wiesel's narrative poem "The Tale of Niggun," which was written in the late 1970s and has been republished with illustrations by Podwal. This collaboration highlights the artistic interpretation of Wiesel's themes and messages.\n\nAdditionally, Wiesel's commentary is featured in "A Passover Haggadah," which is illustrated by Mark Podwal. This work combines the traditional text of the Haggadah with Wiesel's reflections on his own experiences and the significance of the Passover story.\n\nMoreover, there is an illustrated edition of Wiesel's seminal memoir "Night," published by The Folio Society. This edition includes artwork by survivors and witnesses, enhancing the emotional impact of Wiesel's powerful narrative about his experiences during the Holocaust.\n\nThese illustrated works serve to deepen the understanding of Wiesel's themes, such as memory, faith, and the moral responsibilities that arise from the Holocaust experience.
