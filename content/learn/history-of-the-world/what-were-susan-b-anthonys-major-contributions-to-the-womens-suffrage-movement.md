    What were Susan B. Anthony's major contributions to the Women's Suffrage Movement?
answer: >-
    Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) was a pivotal figure in the Women's Suffrage Movement in the United States, known for her tireless advocacy for women's rights and her significant contributions to the fight for women's suffrage. Here are some of her major contributions:\n\n1. **Co-founding Key Organizations**: Anthony co-founded the American Equal Rights Association in 1866, which aimed to secure equal rights for all, regardless of gender or race. She also played a crucial role in founding the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869 alongside Elizabeth Cady Stanton, which focused specifically on women's suffrage.\n\n2. **Advocacy and Public Speaking**: Throughout her life, Anthony traveled extensively, giving speeches and lectures to raise awareness about women's rights and suffrage. She was known for her powerful oratory skills and her ability to mobilize support for the cause.\n\n3. **The Revolution Newspaper**: In 1868, Anthony and Stanton became editors of "The Revolution," a newspaper that advocated for women's rights and suffrage. This publication was instrumental in disseminating ideas about gender equality and mobilizing public opinion.\n\n4. **Test Voting**: In 1872, Anthony famously cast a "test vote" in Rochester, New York, in defiance of laws prohibiting women from voting. This act of civil disobedience was intended to challenge the legal system and assert women's right to vote, leading to her arrest and subsequent trial.\n\n5. **Historical Documentation**: Anthony, along with Stanton, initiated the writing of a history of the women's suffrage movement in 1876. This work was important for documenting the struggles and achievements of women in their fight for rights.\n\n6. **Advocacy for the 19th Amendment**: Although Anthony died in 1906, 14 years before the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, her efforts laid the groundwork for this landmark legislation, which granted women the right to vote. The amendment was informally referred to as the "Susan B. Anthony Amendment" in recognition of her contributions.\n\n7. **Legacy and Recognition**: Anthony's legacy continues to be honored today. She became the first woman to be depicted on U.S. currency when the Susan B. Anthony dollar was issued in 1979. Her work is celebrated in various memorials and museums, including the Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, New York.\n\nThrough her relentless activism, Susan B. Anthony not only advanced the cause of women's suffrage but also inspired future generations to continue the fight for gender equality. Her contributions remain a significant part of American history and the ongoing struggle for women's rights.
