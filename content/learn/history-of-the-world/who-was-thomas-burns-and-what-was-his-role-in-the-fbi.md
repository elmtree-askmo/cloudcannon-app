    Who was Thomas Burns and what was his role in the FBI?
answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information primarily discusses various individuals named Burns, including William John Burns, who was a private investigator and law enforcement official, and another Thomas Burns who had a significant role in U.S. diplomacy. However, there is no specific information regarding a Thomas Burns associated with the FBI or his role within the organization. This lack of context limits the ability to provide a comprehensive answer about Thomas Burns and his contributions to the FBI.
