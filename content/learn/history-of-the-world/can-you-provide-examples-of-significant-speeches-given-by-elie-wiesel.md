answer: >-
    Elie Wiesel, a prominent Holocaust survivor and author, delivered several significant speeches throughout his life that addressed themes of memory, justice, and the human condition. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n1. **Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech (1986)**: Delivered on December 10, 1986, in Oslo, Norway, Wiesel's acceptance speech emphasized the importance of memory and the responsibility to act against injustice. He stated, "I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation." This speech is often regarded as one of the most impactful speeches of the 20th century and has been widely quoted in discussions about human rights.\n\n2. **The Perils of Indifference (1999)**: In this speech delivered to a joint session of the United States Congress on April 12, 1999, Wiesel discussed the dangers of indifference to suffering and injustice. He reflected on the lessons learned from the Holocaust and urged listeners to remain vigilant against oppression, stating, "Indifference reduces the other to an abstraction."\n\n3. **Auschwitz Liberation Anniversary Speech (1995)**: Wiesel spoke at the ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where he poignantly remarked, "After Auschwitz, the human condition is not the same, nothing will be the same." This speech highlighted the lasting impact of the Holocaust on humanity and the moral imperative to remember and learn from the past.\n\nThese speeches not only reflect Wiesel's personal experiences and insights but also serve as powerful calls to action against injustice and a reminder of the importance of memory in shaping a more compassionate world.
