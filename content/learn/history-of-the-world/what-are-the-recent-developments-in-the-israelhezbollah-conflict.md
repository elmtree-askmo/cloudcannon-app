    What are the recent developments in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict?
answer: >-
    Recent developments in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict have seen significant escalations and a subsequent ceasefire agreement. The conflict intensified following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which prompted Hezbollah to launch rocket strikes into northern Israel. In response, Israel conducted extensive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut.\n\nAs the situation escalated, Israel launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon, marking a significant escalation in their long-running conflict. This invasion followed nearly two weeks of intense aerial bombardment, which resulted in substantial casualties and displacement within Lebanon, with reports indicating over 1,000 deaths and nearly a million people forced to flee their homes.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, a ceasefire agreement was reached, effectively ending 14 months of conflict. The ceasefire was brokered by the United States and included provisions for the withdrawal of Israeli and Hezbollah forces from the area between the Blue Line (the unofficial border) and the Litani River over a period of 60 days. Following the ceasefire, thousands of Lebanese began returning to their homes in southern Lebanon, although Hezbollah vowed to continue its support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe ceasefire has been described as a "ray of hope" by UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, and there are hopes that it could lead to a more permanent resolution to the ongoing tensions in the region. However, the situation remains fragile, with both sides exchanging fire even after the ceasefire was announced, raising concerns about the potential for renewed conflict.
