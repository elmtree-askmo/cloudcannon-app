    What did Immanuel Kant mean by 'emergence from self-imposed immaturity' in the context of the Enlightenment?
answer: >-
    Immanuel Kant's phrase "emergence from self-imposed immaturity" encapsulates a central theme of the Enlightenment, which he elaborated in his 1784 essay "What is Enlightenment?" In this context, Kant defines immaturity as the inability to use one's own understanding without the guidance of another. He argues that many individuals remain in a state of immaturity because they are unwilling or afraid to think independently, relying instead on external authorities—be they religious, political, or social—to dictate their beliefs and actions.\n\nKant emphasizes that the Enlightenment is characterized by the courage to think for oneself, to question established norms, and to resist the constraints imposed by tradition and authority. He advocates for the use of reason as a tool for intellectual freedom, suggesting that individuals must take responsibility for their own thoughts and decisions. This process of emerging from immaturity involves a commitment to critical thinking and skepticism towards accepted truths, which were particularly relevant in the face of the absolute power of monarchs and the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church during his time.\n\nIn summary, Kant's notion of "emergence from self-imposed immaturity" is a call to intellectual independence and a rejection of passive acceptance of authority, urging individuals to engage in rational thought and to seek knowledge through their own understanding. This idea is foundational to the principles of the Enlightenment, which sought to promote human rights, personal freedom, and social reforms through the application of reason.
