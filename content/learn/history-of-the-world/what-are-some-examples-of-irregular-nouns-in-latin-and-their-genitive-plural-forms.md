    What are some examples of irregular nouns in Latin and their genitive plural forms?
answer: >-
    In Latin, irregular nouns often deviate from standard declension patterns, particularly in their genitive plural forms. Here are some examples of irregular nouns along with their genitive plural forms:\n\n1. **Parens** (parent) - Genitive plural: **parentum**\n2. **Panis** (bread) - Genitive plural: **panum**\n3. **Memor** (mindful) - Genitive plural: **memorum**\n4. **Inops** (poor) - Genitive plural: **inopum**\n5. **Supplex** (supplicant) - Genitive plural: **supplicum**\n6. **Vetus** (old) - Genitive plural: **veturum**\n7. **Uber** (nourishing) - Genitive plural: **uberum**\n8. **Lynx** (lynx) - Genitive plural: **lyncum**\n\nThese nouns are primarily from the third declension and exhibit unique genitive plural endings that differ from the more common patterns. For instance, while many third declension nouns have genitive plural forms ending in -ium or -um, these irregular nouns follow their own specific rules. Understanding these exceptions is crucial for mastering Latin inflection rules and accurately using the language.
