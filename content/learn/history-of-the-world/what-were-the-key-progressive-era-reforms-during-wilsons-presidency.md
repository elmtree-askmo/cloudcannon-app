    What were the key Progressive Era reforms during Wilson's presidency?
answer: >-
    During Woodrow Wilson's presidency (1913-1921), several key Progressive Era reforms were enacted that significantly shaped American economic, political, and social landscapes. Here are some of the most notable reforms:\n\n1. **Federal Reserve Act (1913)**: One of Wilson's most enduring legislative accomplishments, this act established the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. It aimed to provide a safer and more flexible monetary and financial system, addressing the financial instability that had been highlighted by the Panic of 1907.\n\n2. **16th Amendment (1913)**: This amendment authorized a federal income tax, allowing the government to collect taxes directly from individuals based on their income. This was a significant shift in federal revenue generation and aimed to reduce reliance on tariffs.\n\n3. **Underwood-Simmons Act (1913)**: This legislation reduced tariff rates and implemented a graduated income tax, which was a key component of Wilson's economic reform agenda. It aimed to lower the cost of goods for consumers and reduce the power of monopolies.\n\n4. **Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (1914)**: The FTC was established to prevent unfair business practices and promote consumer protection. It was tasked with investigating and stopping unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices in the marketplace.\n\n5. **Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)**: This act strengthened antitrust laws by prohibiting specific anti-competitive practices and protecting the rights of labor unions and agricultural organizations. It aimed to promote fair competition and curb monopolistic practices.\n\n6. **Labor Reforms**: Wilson's administration supported various labor reforms, including the establishment of an eight-hour workday for railroad workers and the promotion of workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively.\n\n7. **Child Labor Legislation**: Wilson's presidency saw efforts to address child labor issues, culminating in the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916, which aimed to restrict child labor in industries engaged in interstate commerce. Although it was later declared unconstitutional, it marked a significant step in the fight against child labor.\n\n8. **Political Reforms**: Wilson's presidency also included the ratification of the 17th Amendment, which mandated the direct election of U.S. senators by the people, replacing the previous system where senators were chosen by state legislatures. This reform aimed to increase democratic participation and reduce corruption.\n\n9. **Prohibition Movement**: Wilson's administration coincided with the rise of the Prohibition Movement, which ultimately led to the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages.\n\n10. **Women's Suffrage Movement**: Although Wilson initially hesitated to support women's suffrage, he eventually endorsed the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, reflecting the growing momentum of the suffrage movement during his presidency.\n\nThese reforms collectively represented a significant shift towards a more active role for the federal government in regulating the economy and addressing social issues, aligning with the broader goals of the Progressive Era. However, Wilson's presidency was also marked by limitations and criticisms, particularly regarding civil rights and racial issues.
