    What was the concept of 'nationalisme de survivance' and how did it manifest?
answer: >-
    The concept of 'nationalisme de survivance' emerged in Lower Canada (Bas-Canada) around 1840 and is primarily associated with the promotion and preservation of the French-Canadian nation. This ideology arose in response to the perceived threat of cultural extinction faced by the French-speaking population in a predominantly English-speaking environment.\n\nNationalisme de survivance sought to highlight and protect key cultural traits that defined the French-Canadian identity, including:\n\n1. **Catholic Religion**: The Catholic Church played a central role in the lives of French Canadians, serving as a bastion of cultural identity and community cohesion.\n2. **French Language**: The preservation of the French language was crucial for maintaining cultural distinctiveness and fostering a sense of belonging among French Canadians.\n3. **Rural and Agricultural Lifestyle**: The ideology emphasized the importance of rural life and agriculture, which were seen as integral to the French-Canadian way of life.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century until the 1960s, this form of nationalism focused on maintaining these cultural characteristics in the face of economic and political challenges. It was characterized by a narrative of survival, where the French-Canadian community sought to assert its identity and resist assimilation into the dominant English-speaking culture.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, particularly with the onset of the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, nationalisme de survivance began to evolve into a more assertive form of nationalism, often referred to as 'nationalisme d'affirmation.' This shift marked a transition from merely surviving as a cultural group to actively promoting and asserting the rights and identity of the French-speaking population in Quebec and Canada.\n\nIn summary, nationalisme de survivance was a crucial ideological movement that aimed to preserve the cultural identity of French Canadians during a time of significant external pressures, laying the groundwork for future expressions of nationalism in Quebec.
