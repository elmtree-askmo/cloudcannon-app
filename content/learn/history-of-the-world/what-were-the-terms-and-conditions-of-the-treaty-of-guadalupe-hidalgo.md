answer: >-
    The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, marked the end of the Mexican-American War and had significant implications for both the United States and Mexico. Here are the key terms and conditions of the treaty:\n\n1. **Territorial Cession**: Mexico ceded a vast amount of territory to the United States, which included present-day California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. This acquisition significantly expanded U.S. territory.\n\n2. **Establishment of Borders**: The treaty established the Rio Grande as the official border between Texas and Mexico, which was a contentious issue prior to the war.\n\n3. **Citizenship Rights**: The treaty granted U.S. citizenship to Mexicans living in the newly acquired territories. This provision aimed to protect the rights of these individuals and ensure their integration into American society.\n\n4. **Financial Compensation**: The United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million as compensation for the ceded lands. Additionally, the U.S. assumed responsibility for claims made by American citizens against the Mexican government, which amounted to about $3.25 million.\n\n5. **Protection of Property Rights**: The treaty included provisions to protect the property rights of Mexicans in the ceded territories, ensuring that their land and property would not be confiscated without due process.\n\n6. **Cultural and Social Considerations**: The treaty acknowledged the cultural and social dynamics of the region, including the rights of the existing Mexican population and the need for their integration into the new political framework.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo significantly altered the geopolitical landscape of North America and laid the groundwork for future Mexican-American relations, influencing demographic, cultural, and political developments in the region.
