    What are the roles of the House of Representatives and the Senate?
answer: >-
    The United States Congress is a bicameral legislature composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Each chamber has distinct roles and responsibilities that contribute to the legislative process.\n\n### House of Representatives\n1. **Composition**: The House consists of 435 members, with the number of representatives from each state determined by its population, as established by the decennial census. Members must be at least 25 years old, U.S. citizens for at least seven years, and residents of the state they represent.\n\n2. **Legislative Role**: The House has the exclusive power to initiate revenue bills and is responsible for impeaching federal officials. Impeachment requires a simple majority vote to bring charges against an official.\n\n3. **Leadership**: The Speaker of the House, elected from the majority party, presides over the House and sets legislative priorities. The House Majority Leader assists in scheduling debates and managing the legislative agenda.\n\n4. **Term Length**: Members serve two-year terms, which leads to a higher turnover rate compared to the Senate. This structure encourages representatives to be responsive to their constituents' needs.\n\n### Senate\n1. **Composition**: The Senate is made up of 100 members, with each state represented by two senators, regardless of population. Senators must be at least 30 years old and have been U.S. citizens for at least nine years.\n\n2. **Legislative Role**: The Senate shares the responsibility of making federal laws with the House. It has the exclusive authority to confirm presidential appointments (such as federal judges and cabinet members) and to ratify treaties. The Senate also conducts trials for impeached officials, requiring a two-thirds majority to convict.\n\n3. **Leadership**: The Vice President of the United States serves as the President of the Senate but only votes in the case of a tie. The President pro tempore, typically the longest-serving member of the majority party, presides in the Vice President's absence.\n\n4. **Term Length**: Senators serve six-year terms, with approximately one-third of the Senate up for election every two years. This staggered election cycle provides greater stability and continuity in the legislative process.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe House of Representatives and the Senate, while both integral to the legislative process, have distinct roles that reflect their different structures and functions. The House is designed for responsiveness to the electorate, while the Senate provides a more deliberative approach to governance. Together, they ensure a balance of power and representation in the U.S. legislative system.
