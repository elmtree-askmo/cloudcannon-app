    What are the main powers and structure of Congress as outlined in Article 1?
answer: >-
    Article I of the United States Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government, known as Congress, which is bicameral, consisting of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. This article is the longest in the Constitution and outlines the powers, structure, and functions of Congress.\n\n### Structure of Congress\n1. **Bicameral Legislature**: Congress is divided into two houses:\n   - **House of Representatives**: Members are elected every two years by the people of the several states. The number of representatives from each state is based on its population.\n   - **Senate**: Each state is represented by two senators, serving six-year terms, with elections staggered so that approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election every two years.\n\n### Main Powers of Congress\nArticle I, particularly Section 8, enumerates several key powers granted to Congress, including but not limited to:\n- **Taxation**: The power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\n- **Regulation of Commerce**: Authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the states, and with Native American tribes.\n- **Coining Money**: The power to coin money and regulate its value.\n- **Establishing Post Offices**: Authority to establish post offices and post roads.\n- **Declaring War**: The power to declare war and raise and support armies and navies.\n- **Naturalization Laws**: The ability to establish rules for naturalization of citizens.\n- **Creating Federal Courts**: The power to create inferior courts beneath the Supreme Court.\n\n### Additional Provisions\n- **Impeachment**: Congress has the authority to impeach federal officials, including the President, with the House having the sole power to impeach and the Senate having the sole power to conduct trials for impeachment.\n- **Legislative Process**: Article I outlines the process for how laws are made, including the requirement that all bills must be presented to the President for approval.\n\n### Limitations\nArticle I also places certain limitations on Congress, such as prohibiting the passage of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder, and it restricts states from exercising certain powers without the consent of Congress.\n\nIn summary, Article I of the Constitution is foundational in establishing the structure and powers of Congress, ensuring a system of checks and balances within the federal government.
