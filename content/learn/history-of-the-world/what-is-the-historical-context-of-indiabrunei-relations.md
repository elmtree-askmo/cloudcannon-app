    What is the historical context of India-Brunei relations?
answer: >-
    The historical context of India-Brunei relations can be traced back to the establishment of diplomatic ties on May 10, 1984. This marked the beginning of formal interactions between India, the largest democracy in the world, and Brunei, one of the oldest monarchies. The Indian mission in Brunei was later established on May 18, 1993, further solidifying these diplomatic relations.\n\nOver the years, the relationship has been characterized by a shared history, culture, and tradition that spans over a millennium. Brunei has played a significant role in India's engagement with the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, particularly during its tenure as the Country Coordinator for ASEAN-India relations from July 2012 to June 2015. This role underscored Brunei's importance in facilitating India's "Look East" and "Act East" policies, aimed at enhancing cooperation with Southeast Asian nations.\n\nA landmark event in the bilateral relationship occurred in May 2008 when the Sultan of Brunei visited India, resulting in the signing of five Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements. The relationship has matured significantly over the past decade, with high-level visits and dialogues becoming more frequent, reflecting a mutual interest in deepening ties.\n\nThe first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Brunei took place in October 2013 during ASEAN-related summits, marking a significant milestone in the diplomatic relationship. More recently, Prime Minister Modi's visit to Brunei in June 2024 coincided with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties, during which both countries agreed to enhance cooperation in various sectors, including defense, energy, multilateralism, and space.\n\nOverall, India-Brunei relations have evolved from a cordial but limited scope to a more robust partnership, with both nations committed to countering regional challenges and fostering greater collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region.
