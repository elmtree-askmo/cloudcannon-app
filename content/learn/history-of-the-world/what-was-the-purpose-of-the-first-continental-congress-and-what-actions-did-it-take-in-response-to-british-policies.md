    What was the purpose of the First Continental Congress, and what actions did it take in response to British policies?
answer: >-
    The First Continental Congress convened in 1774 as a direct response to escalating tensions between the American colonies and British authorities, particularly following the imposition of the Intolerable Acts (Coercive Acts). The primary purpose of the Congress was to address colonial grievances and to organize a unified response to British policies that were perceived as oppressive.\n\n### Key Actions Taken by the First Continental Congress:\n\n1. **Formation of a Collective Response**: Delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (Georgia did not send representatives) gathered in Philadelphia to discuss their shared concerns. This marked a significant step toward colonial unity, as the delegates began to see themselves as part of a collective entity rather than separate colonies.\n\n2. **Boycott of British Goods**: One of the most significant actions taken was the decision to implement a boycott of British goods. This economic strategy aimed to resist British taxation and trade restrictions, demonstrating the colonies' willingness to oppose British authority through coordinated economic measures.\n\n3. **Petitioning the King**: The Congress drafted a petition to King George III, outlining their grievances and seeking redress. This petition expressed a desire for reconciliation and reform rather than outright independence at that stage.\n\n4. **Establishment of Committees**: The Congress encouraged the formation of local committees to enforce the boycott and to gather supplies and organize militias. This grassroots mobilization was crucial in preparing the colonies for potential conflict.\n\n5. **Preparation for Further Action**: While the First Continental Congress sought to address issues through peaceful means, it also laid the groundwork for future actions, including the eventual formation of the Continental Army and the decision to declare independence, which would be addressed by the Second Continental Congress in 1775.\n\nIn summary, the First Continental Congress served as a pivotal moment in the American Revolution, uniting the colonies in their opposition to British policies and setting the stage for further revolutionary actions.
