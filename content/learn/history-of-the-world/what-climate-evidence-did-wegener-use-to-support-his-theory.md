    What climate evidence did Wegener use to support his theory?
answer: >-
    Alfred Wegener used several lines of climatic evidence to support his theory of continental drift. One of the key aspects of his argument was the observation that many continents currently have climates that are inconsistent with their present positions. For instance, Wegener noted that fossil evidence indicated that regions now characterized by tropical climates, such as parts of North America and Europe, once had a much colder climate, suggesting they were located closer to the poles in the past.\n\nWegener, along with climatologist Vladimir Koppen, plotted ancient climatic zones, including deserts, jungles, and ice sheets, on paleogeographic maps. This mapping demonstrated that continents, when positioned together as a supercontinent (which he termed Pangaea), could explain the distribution of these climatic features. For example, the presence of glacial deposits in now tropical regions indicated that those areas had once been situated in colder latitudes.\n\nAdditionally, Wegener pointed to the existence of coal deposits in regions that are currently too cold to support the growth of the tropical plants from which coal is formed. This further supported the idea that continents had drifted from their original positions, leading to the climatic discrepancies observed today.\n\nIn summary, Wegener's climatic evidence included:\n1. The presence of glacial deposits in tropical regions.\n2. The distribution of coal deposits in areas that are now too cold for tropical vegetation.\n3. The mapping of ancient climatic zones that aligned with the positions of continents when they were joined together.\n\nThese observations collectively reinforced his hypothesis that continents had moved over geological time, leading to the current distribution of climates across the globe.
