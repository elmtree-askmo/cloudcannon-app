    What was the Tea Act of 1773 and how did it lead to the Boston Tea Party?
answer: >-
    The Tea Act of 1773 was a significant piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament on May 10, 1773. Its primary purpose was to assist the financially troubled British East India Company by granting it a monopoly on tea sales in the American colonies. The act allowed the company to sell its surplus tea directly to the colonies, effectively undercutting local merchants and smugglers who had been importing tea from other sources, particularly the Dutch.\n\nWhile the Tea Act did not impose any new taxes on tea, it retained the existing duty on imported tea, which was a point of contention for the colonists. The act was perceived as a means for the British government to reassert control over the colonies and to bail out the East India Company, which was struggling with a surplus of 17 million pounds of tea. This situation was exacerbated by the fact that many colonial merchants were already boycotting British tea due to previous taxation issues, particularly the Townshend Acts.\n\nThe passage of the Tea Act ignited widespread resistance among the colonists, who viewed it as another instance of "taxation without representation." This sentiment was particularly strong in Boston, where tensions were already high. On December 16, 1773, in a direct response to the Tea Act, a group of about 60 colonists, known as the Sons of Liberty, disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians and boarded three British ships in Boston Harbor. They proceeded to dump 342 chests of tea, valued at approximately Â£18,000, into the water. This act of defiance became known as the Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe Boston Tea Party was a pivotal moment in American history, as it escalated tensions between the colonies and Britain. In retaliation, the British government enacted the Coercive Acts (also known as the Intolerable Acts), which further restricted colonial autonomy and fueled the revolutionary movement. The Tea Act and the Boston Tea Party thus played crucial roles in galvanizing colonial resistance and setting the stage for the American Revolution.
