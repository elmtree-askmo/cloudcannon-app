    How did the National Origins Act of 1924 further restrict immigration to the United States?
answer: >-
    The National Origins Act of 1924 significantly restricted immigration to the United States through a national origins quota system. Here are the key ways in which it further limited immigration:\n\n1. **Establishment of Quotas**: The Act set a total immigration quota of 165,000 for countries outside the Western Hemisphere, which represented an 80% reduction from the average number of immigrants allowed before World War I. This drastic cut was aimed at limiting the influx of immigrants, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe.\n\n2. **Use of the 1890 Census**: The quotas were based on the national origins of the population as recorded in the 1890 census, rather than the more recent 1910 census. This choice was influenced by eugenics ideologies and aimed to favor immigrants from Northern and Western Europe while discriminating against those from Southern and Eastern Europe. Specifically, the Act allowed immigration visas to only 2% of the total number of people of each nationality residing in the U.S. as of the 1890 census, which effectively reduced the number of immigrants from countries that had seen significant growth in their populations since then.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Asian Immigrants**: The Act completely barred immigration from Asia, including Japan, which had previously allowed some immigration. This exclusion was a continuation of the discriminatory practices established by earlier legislation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The only exception was for the Philippines, which was a U.S. colony at the time, allowing its citizens to enter freely as U.S. nationals.\n\n4. **Long-term Impact**: The National Origins Act established a framework for immigration policy that would remain in place until 1965. It created a system that was quantitatively discriminatory, favoring certain nationalities over others based on arbitrary historical census data, and set a precedent for future immigration legislation.\n\n5. **Cultural and Racial Bias**: The Act was influenced by nativist sentiments and fears of cultural dilution, reflecting broader social fears and prejudices of the time. It was part of a larger trend of isolationism and xenophobia that characterized American attitudes in the post-WWI era.\n\nIn summary, the National Origins Act of 1924 further restricted immigration by implementing strict quotas based on outdated census data, completely barring Asian immigrants, and establishing a long-lasting framework for discriminatory immigration policies.
