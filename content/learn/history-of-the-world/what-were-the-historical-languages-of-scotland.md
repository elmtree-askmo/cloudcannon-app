    What were the historical languages of Scotland?
answer: >-
    The historical languages of Scotland are primarily Scots and Scottish Gaelic, with English also playing a significant role in the linguistic landscape.\n\n1. **Scots Language**: Scots is a historic language of the people of Lowland Scotland, closely related to English. It is descended from Northern English and became prominent in the Lowlands, particularly from the 11th to the 14th centuries, as Anglo-Norman rule influenced the region. By the period of 1350-1450, Scots had emerged as the favored language of the royal court, parliament, and burghs, developing a distinct literary identity. Scots is part of the West Germanic language family and is spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland), and even in parts of northern Ulster in Ireland, where it is known as Ulster Scots.\n\n2. **Scottish Gaelic**: Gaelic is the ancient tongue of Scotland and is considered a foundational language of the country. It belongs to the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages and has been part of Scottish culture for centuries. By the early 15th century, Gaelic was widely spoken, possibly by half the population, and remained the primary language in the Highlands. The language has seen a decline in speakers over the centuries, particularly as Scots and later English became more dominant.\n\n3. **English**: English, which became the most widely spoken language in Scotland, has its roots in Northumbrian Old English, which was established in southeastern Scotland by the 7th century. Over time, English absorbed influences from Scots, Gaelic, and other languages, becoming the dominant language in many areas, especially after the merger of the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England in 1701.\n\n4. **Influence of Other Languages**: The linguistic history of Scotland is also marked by the influence of other languages, including Norman French, Latin, and Scandinavian languages, due to various historical interactions and migrations.\n\nIn summary, the historical languages of Scotland reflect a rich tapestry of cultural influences, with Scots and Gaelic being the primary indigenous languages, while English has become the most widely spoken language in contemporary Scotland.
