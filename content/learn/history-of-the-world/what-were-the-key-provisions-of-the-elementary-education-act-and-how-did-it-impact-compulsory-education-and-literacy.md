answer: >-
    The Elementary Education Act of 1870, also known as the Forster Act, was a significant piece of legislation during the Victorian Era that aimed to improve education in England and Wales. Here are the key provisions and impacts of the Act:\n\n### Key Provisions of the Elementary Education Act of 1870:\n1. **Establishment of School Boards**: The Act allowed for the creation of school boards in areas where educational provision was inadequate. These boards were responsible for establishing and maintaining schools.\n\n2. **Compulsory Education**: By 1880, the Act mandated that education be compulsory for children aged 5 to 10 years. This marked a significant shift towards recognizing the importance of education and literacy for all children.\n\n3. **Funding and Support**: The Act provided for government funding to support the establishment of schools, which helped to alleviate the financial burden on local communities.\n\n4. **Non-Denominational Education**: The Act aimed to provide non-denominational education, which meant that schools could not be affiliated with any particular religious group, promoting a more inclusive educational environment.\n\n5. **Quality of Education**: The Act emphasized the need for quality education, leading to the establishment of standards and regulations for schools.\n\n### Impact on Compulsory Education and Literacy:\n- **Increased Access to Education**: The establishment of school boards and the requirement for compulsory education significantly increased access to education for children, particularly in urban areas where educational facilities were previously lacking.\n\n- **Rise in Literacy Rates**: The introduction of compulsory education contributed to a marked increase in literacy rates among the population. By ensuring that children received basic education, the Act laid the groundwork for a more educated society.\n\n- **Social Mobility**: With more children receiving an education, the Act facilitated greater social mobility, allowing individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to improve their prospects through education.\n\n- **Foundation for Future Reforms**: The Elementary Education Act set a precedent for future educational reforms, leading to further legislation aimed at expanding access to education and improving educational standards.\n\nIn summary, the Elementary Education Act of 1870 was a pivotal development in the history of education in England, establishing compulsory education and significantly impacting literacy rates and access to education for children across the country.
