answer: >-
    On November 27, 1978, a tragic and pivotal event unfolded in San Francisco when former Supervisor Dan White assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk inside City Hall. The sequence of events began early that day when Moscone was scheduled to announce the appointment of a new supervisor to fill the position that White had vacated. White, feeling aggrieved by his resignation and the subsequent decision not to reappoint him, entered City Hall with a .38 caliber revolver.\n\nAround 10:45 AM, White first approached Moscone in his office. After a brief conversation, White shot Moscone in the chest, killing him instantly. Following this, White hurried to the shared office of the Board of Supervisors, where he found Harvey Milk. He shot Milk multiple times, also resulting in Milk's death. After the shootings, White fled the scene, leaving behind a shocked and devastated city.\n\nThe murders sent shockwaves through San Francisco and the nation, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community, which Milk had been a prominent advocate for. In the aftermath, over 30,000 people participated in a peaceful march from the Castro district to City Hall, holding a candlelight vigil to honor the victims.\n\nThe assassinations were not only a significant moment in the history of San Francisco but also marked a turning point in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, highlighting the political tensions of the time and the challenges faced by the community. The events surrounding the assassinations and the subsequent trial of Dan White, which included the controversial "Twinkie defense," would further shape the socio-political landscape of the era.
