    What is the historical context and recent developments in Maldives-India relations?
answer: >-
    The historical context of Maldives-India relations dates back to 1965 when the Maldives gained independence from British control. India was one of the first countries to recognize the Maldives and establish diplomatic relations. Over the years, the relationship has evolved significantly, characterized by deep cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and commercial ties. The two nations have cooperated in various sectors, including trade, tourism, and defense, reflecting a warm and complex partnership.\n\nIn recent years, particularly since the democratic transition in the Maldives in 2008, India has invested in building strong relationships with various stakeholders in the Maldives, including political, military, business, and civil society figures. The Maldives has been a partner of India in several regional groupings, such as the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC), Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), and SAARC.\n\nHowever, the relationship has faced challenges, particularly with the Maldives' increasing engagement with China, which has raised strategic concerns for India. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has seen significant Chinese investments in Maldivian infrastructure, leading to fears of debt-trap diplomacy that could undermine India's influence in the region.\n\nA notable shift occurred with the election of President Mohamed Muizzu in 2023, who campaigned on an anti-India platform. His administration has called for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel stationed in the Maldives and has threatened to review existing agreements with India. This stance is reminiscent of the "India Out" campaign led by former President Abdulla Yameen, which criticized the previous administration for compromising Maldivian sovereignty by allowing Indian military presence.\n\nDespite these tensions, recent developments indicate a potential reset in relations. President Muizzu's government has recognized India's significant role in the region, particularly in economic and security matters. A document signed between India and the Maldives aims to transform their bilateral relationship into a "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership." This partnership includes commitments to bolster defense and security cooperation, develop digital and financial infrastructure, and enhance tourism ties, with India being a major source of tourists for the Maldives.\n\nIn summary, while historical ties between India and the Maldives have been strong, recent political shifts and the growing influence of China pose challenges to their relationship. However, both nations appear to be seeking a path forward that acknowledges their mutual interests and the importance of cooperation in addressing regional security and economic challenges.
