    How did the decline of the Indian handloom industry occur under British rule?
answer: >-
    The decline of the Indian handloom industry under British rule was a multifaceted process driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Imposition of High Taxes and Trade Restrictions**: The British colonial administration imposed heavy taxes on Indian artisans and weavers, which significantly increased production costs. These taxes were designed to balance trade but ultimately placed a financial burden on local industries. As a result, Indian handloom products became less competitive compared to cheaper British imports.\n\n2. **Cheap British Imports**: The influx of inexpensive British textiles into the Indian market displaced traditional artisanal goods. By the early 19th century, British textile exports to India began to outnumber Indian textile exports, leading to a significant decline in local production. For instance, by the 1820s, Indian yarn was priced at twice the cost of English yarn, making it difficult for Indian weavers to sustain their livelihoods.\n\n3. **Deindustrialization and Loss of Market Share**: India, which had once produced 25% of the world's textiles in the 17th century, saw its share plummet to just 2% by the end of British colonialism in 1947. The British policies effectively transformed India into a raw material supplier for British industries while simultaneously undermining its own textile production capabilities. This led to a broader trend of secular de-industrialization across various sectors in India.\n\n4. **Legislative Measures Against Indian Textiles**: The British government enacted laws such as the Calico Acts in the early 18th century, which prohibited the import of Indian cotton cloth to protect British textile manufacturers. This legislative action further restricted the market for Indian textiles and contributed to the decline of the handloom industry.\n\n5. **Cultural and Social Impact**: The decline of the handloom industry also had profound social and cultural implications. The traditional craftsmanship that was integral to Indian identity and economy was undermined, leading to a loss of skills and cultural heritage associated with handloom weaving.\n\nIn summary, the decline of the Indian handloom industry under British rule was a result of a combination of high taxation, competition from cheap British imports, legislative restrictions, and a broader policy of deindustrialization that favored British economic interests over Indian craftsmanship. This transformation not only devastated the handloom sector but also had lasting effects on India's economic landscape.
