    Who were the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and what was their artistic philosophy?
answer: >-
    The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in 1848 by a group of seven artists, which included Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and John Everett Millais. Their artistic philosophy was characterized by a rejection of the artistic conventions established during the Renaissance, particularly the idealized forms and techniques that dominated the art of that period. Instead, they sought to return to a more sincere and direct style, drawing inspiration from medieval art and nature.\n\nThe Brotherhood aimed to create works that were rich in detail, vibrant in color, and imbued with a sense of realism and emotional depth. They believed in the importance of observing nature closely and depicted subjects with meticulous attention to detail. This approach was intended to evoke a sense of truthfulness and authenticity in their art, contrasting sharply with the more polished and idealized representations of their contemporaries.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood significantly influenced the visual arts of the Victorian era, promoting a new aesthetic that emphasized narrative content and emotional resonance, which can be seen in their paintings that often depicted literary and historical themes. Their work laid the groundwork for later movements in art, including Symbolism and the Arts and Crafts Movement.
