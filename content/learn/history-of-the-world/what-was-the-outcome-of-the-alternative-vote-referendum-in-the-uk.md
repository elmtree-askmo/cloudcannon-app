    What was the outcome of the Alternative Vote Referendum in the UK?
answer: >-
    The Alternative Vote Referendum in the United Kingdom took place on 5 May 2011. The referendum was held to determine whether to change the electoral system used for electing Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons from the "first past the post" system to the Alternative Vote (AV) system. \n\nThe outcome of the referendum was that 67.9% of voters opposed the change to the Alternative Vote, while only 32.1% supported it. The turnout for the referendum was 42.0%. Notably, the "No" vote was in the majority across all regions of the UK. This referendum coincided with elections for the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and various local authorities, which may have influenced voter engagement and turnout.\n\nAs a result of the referendum, the electoral system for the House of Commons remained unchanged, continuing to use the first past the post system.
