    What is the historical background of the Katchatheevu Island Controversy?
answer: >-
    The Katchatheevu Island controversy is a significant issue in the context of India-Sri Lanka relations, primarily revolving around fishing rights and territorial sovereignty. Katchatheevu is a small, uninhabited island, measuring approximately 285 acres, located in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, about 14 nautical miles off the coast of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.\n\n### Historical Background\n\n1. **Early Control**: The origins of Katchatheevu can be traced back to the Nayak dynasty, when it was part of the Ramnad Zamindari, established in 1605. Initially, the island was under the control of the Jaffna kingdom of Sri Lanka during the early medieval period.\n\n2. **Colonial Era**: In the 17th century, control of Katchatheevu shifted to the Ramnad zamindari, which was based in Ramanathapuram, India. During the British Raj, the island became part of the Madras Presidency. In 1921, both India and Sri Lanka, then British colonies, laid claim to Katchatheevu to determine fishing boundaries. A survey marked the island as part of Sri Lanka, but this was contested by a British delegation from India, citing the Ramnad kingdom's ownership.\n\n3. **1974 Agreement**: The controversy reached a pivotal moment in 1974 when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirima R.D. Bandaranaike signed an agreement that officially recognized Katchatheevu as part of Sri Lanka's territory. This agreement also included provisions for Indian fishermen to fish in the waters around the island, but it has been a source of ongoing tension, particularly among Tamil Nadu fishermen who feel their rights have been compromised.\n\n### Contemporary Issues\n\nThe Katchatheevu controversy has sparked political debates in India, especially in Tamil Nadu, where local leaders, including Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, have renewed calls for the retrieval of the island. The issue is often leveraged in political discourse, with parties accusing each other of neglecting the rights and livelihoods of fishermen who depend on these waters.\n\nThe island is also culturally significant, hosting St. Anthony's Church, which has been a pilgrimage site for devotees from both India and Sri Lanka. The annual festival at the church draws large crowds, further intertwining the island's cultural and political significance.\n\nIn summary, the Katchatheevu Island controversy is rooted in historical claims and colonial legacies, and it continues to impact the socio-political landscape of India and Sri Lanka, particularly concerning the rights of fishermen and regional diplomatic relations.
