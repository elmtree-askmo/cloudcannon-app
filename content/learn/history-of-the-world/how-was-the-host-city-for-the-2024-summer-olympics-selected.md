    How was the host city for the 2024 Summer Olympics selected?
answer: >-
    The host city for the 2024 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, was selected through a historic decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during its session in Lima, Peru, on September 13, 2017. The selection process was unique as it involved awarding both the 2024 and 2028 Olympic Games simultaneously, a departure from the traditional practice of selecting one host city at a time.\n\nInitially, Paris and Los Angeles were the two candidate cities vying for the 2024 Games. The decision to award both cities was influenced by the withdrawals of other potential bidders, which left only these two cities in contention. The IOC recognized the opportunity to secure the future of the Games by granting Paris the 2024 Olympics and Los Angeles the 2028 Olympics.\n\nThe process began with Paris formally announcing its intention to bid on June 23, 2015. Following a series of discussions and evaluations, the IOC concluded that Paris was the preferred host for the 2024 Games. On July 31, 2017, the IOC officially announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 Games, thereby confirming Paris as the host for 2024.\n\nThis decision was part of the IOC's broader Olympic Agenda 2020 reforms, aimed at ensuring the sustainability and viability of the Olympic Games. The confirmation of Paris as the host city marked a significant moment, as it returned the Olympics to the French capital exactly 100 years after it last hosted the Games in 1924.
