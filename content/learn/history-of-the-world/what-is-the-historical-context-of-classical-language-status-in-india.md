    What is the historical context of classical language status in India?
answer: >-
    The historical context of classical language status in India is rooted in the country's rich linguistic diversity and cultural heritage. The Government of India established criteria for granting classical language status to languages that possess a significant historical legacy, a vast corpus of ancient literature, and an independent literary tradition. \n\nInitially, Tamil was recognized as a classical language in 2004, followed by Sanskrit in 2005, and several others including Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, and Odia in subsequent years. These languages are considered custodians of India's ancient cultural legacy, preserving the history, literature, and traditions of their respective communities.\n\nThe recent decision by the Union Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to confer classical language status to Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali has expanded the total number of classical languages in India to eleven. This recognition highlights the importance of these languages in understanding the evolution of modern Indian languages and their role in the cultural and historical narrative of the nation.\n\nClassical languages in India are not only significant for their literary contributions but also for their influence on contemporary languages and their representation of key historical and cultural milestones. The classification of these languages underscores the importance of preserving and promoting India's linguistic heritage as an integral part of its identity.
