answer: >-
    The publication of Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives" in 1890 had a profound impact on society, particularly in raising awareness about the dire living conditions faced by the urban poor in New York City. At the time, many members of the upper and middle classes were largely unaware of the squalid conditions in the tenements where poor immigrants lived. Riis combined powerful photography with compelling journalism to document these conditions, effectively shocking the conscience of his readers.\n\nThe book was an instant success and played a crucial role in the Progressive Era's social reform movements. It not only highlighted the struggles of the impoverished but also called for immediate action to improve their living conditions. Notably, Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt, who was committed to reforming New York City, was influenced by Riis's work. He famously remarked to Riis that the book had opened his eyes to the realities of urban poverty.\n\nThe impact of "How the Other Half Lives" extended beyond immediate public awareness; it also contributed to significant legislative changes. For instance, the book helped spur the passage of the Tenement House Act of 1901, which mandated improvements in ventilation, lighting, sanitation, and fire safety in tenement buildings. This legislation was a direct response to the conditions Riis had documented and advocated against.\n\nOverall, Riis's work not only served as a catalyst for social reform but also established a tradition of documentary photography that would influence future generations of social reformers and journalists. His efforts in combining visual imagery with social critique laid the groundwork for ongoing discussions about public health, sanitation, and the rights of the urban poor.
