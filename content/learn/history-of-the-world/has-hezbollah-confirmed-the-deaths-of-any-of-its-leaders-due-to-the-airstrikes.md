    Has Hezbollah confirmed the deaths of any of its leaders due to the airstrikes?
answer: >-
    Yes, Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, due to Israeli airstrikes in Beirut. The confirmation came shortly after Israel announced that it had targeted Nasrallah's underground headquarters in the Lebanese capital. This event marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, as Nasrallah had been a prominent figure leading Hezbollah for over 32 years. The Israeli military stated that the airstrikes aimed at Hezbollah leaders were part of a broader campaign against the group, which has been involved in escalating tensions in the region, particularly in response to the conflict involving Hamas and the situation in Gaza.
