    What were the wage comparisons between industrial workers in Britain and other countries during the Industrial Revolution?
answer: >-
    During the Industrial Revolution, wage comparisons between industrial workers in Britain and those in other countries reveal significant disparities. Research indicates that British wages were substantially higher than those in many other European cities, particularly after 1650. For instance, when comparing real wage series from cities such as Amsterdam, Milan, Florence, Madrid, Antwerp, and Strasbourg, British wages consistently appeared more favorable, especially in the context of the economic conditions of the time.\n\nIn Britain, real wages for male and female manual workers showed a gradual increase from 1770 to 1870, although the growth was not as rapid as the increase in real GDP per worker. By 1820, real wages had risen by approximately 12% since 1770, while GDP per worker had increased by about 16%. This suggests that while workers were experiencing some wage growth, it was not keeping pace with overall economic productivity.\n\nIn contrast, other regions, such as Scotland, saw wages increase rapidly in the latter half of the 18th century, but they remained below the average wage levels found in England. This pattern of wage disparity was reflective of broader economic conditions, where the southern regions of Britain were relatively prosperous compared to the north, a trend that has persisted since the 1920s.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that while Britain was experiencing a high wage economy during the Industrial Revolution, other countries lagged behind, highlighting the unique economic context of Britain during this transformative period.
