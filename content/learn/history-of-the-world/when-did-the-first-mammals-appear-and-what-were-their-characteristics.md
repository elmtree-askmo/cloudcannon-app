    When did the first mammals appear and what were their characteristics?
answer: >-
    The first mammals appeared at least 178 million years ago, during the late Triassic period, with the earliest known mammal fossils dating back to the early Jurassic period, approximately 205 million years ago. These early mammals evolved from therapsids, which are often referred to as "mammal-like reptiles." \n\nThe characteristics of these first mammals included:\n\n1. **Size and Appearance**: The earliest mammals were small, shrew-like creatures, some measuring only a few centimeters in length. They were nocturnal insectivores, resembling modern-day rodents in their general form.\n\n2. **Dentition**: Early mammals exhibited diphyodont dentition, meaning they had two sets of teeth during their lifetime. This feature is significant for their success as it allowed for more efficient processing of food.\n\n3. **Skull Structure**: Mammals are classified as synapsids, characterized by a single temporal fenestra (an opening in the skull behind the eyes). This skull structure is a key distinguishing feature that separates them from reptiles.\n\n4. **Adaptations for Activity**: The early mammals had adaptations that supported a more active lifestyle, such as efficient circulation with a four-chambered heart, hair for insulation, and endothermy (warm-bloodedness). These adaptations allowed them to thrive in the ecological niches that were available, especially after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\nOverall, the evolution of mammals represents a significant transition in vertebrate history, showcasing how these small, early forms adapted to their environments and eventually diversified into the wide variety of mammals we see today.
