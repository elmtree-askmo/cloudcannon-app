    Which parties are involved in the coalition and who are the key leaders in Jammu and Kashmir?
answer: >-
    In Jammu and Kashmir, the political landscape is characterized by several key parties and leaders, particularly following the recent elections. The major parties involved in the coalition include:\n\n1. **National Conference (NC)**: This party emerged as the single largest party in the recent elections, winning 42 seats in the 90-member Assembly. The NC has a long history in the region, originally founded in 1932 as the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference by Sheikh Abdullah.\n\n2. **Indian National Congress (INC)**: The INC has formed a coalition with the National Conference, indicating a significant political alliance in the region.\n\n3. **Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)**: The BJP retained a strong presence in Jammu, winning 29 seats. The party has been actively involved in reshaping the political dynamics in Jammu and Kashmir, especially after the abrogation of Article 370.\n\n4. **People's Democratic Party (PDP)**: Led by Mehbooba Mufti, the PDP has also been a significant player in the region, although its recent electoral performance has seen it win only three seats.\n\n5. **Democratic Progressive Azad Party**: Founded by former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in September 2022, this party has yet to make a substantial impact on the political scene in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nKey leaders in Jammu and Kashmir include:\n\n- **Farooq Abdullah**: The president of the National Conference and a prominent political figure in the region.\n- **Mehbooba Mufti**: The leader of the People's Democratic Party and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.\n- **Ghulam Nabi Azad**: A former Congress leader who established the Democratic Progressive Azad Party.\n\nThe political dynamics in Jammu and Kashmir continue to evolve, with ongoing discussions about self-determination and the aspirations of the Kashmiri populace. The coalition between the National Conference and the Indian National Congress marks a significant shift in the region's political trajectory.
