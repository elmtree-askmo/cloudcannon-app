    What were the main factors leading to the Devonian-Carboniferous extinction?
answer: >-
    The Devonian-Carboniferous extinction, which occurred around 359 million years ago, is characterized by a series of mass extinction events primarily affecting marine communities. The main factors leading to this extinction event are complex and likely involve a combination of several interrelated stresses:\n\n1. **Oceanic Anoxia**: One of the significant contributors to the extinction is believed to be oceanic anoxia, where large areas of the ocean became depleted of oxygen. This condition is thought to have been exacerbated by various environmental changes, including the expansion of land plants, which may have altered nutrient runoff and contributed to deoxygenation (Algeo et al., 1995; Bond et al., 2013).\n\n2. **Climate Change**: Both rapid global warming and cooling have been proposed as potential triggers for the extinction. Changes in sea level, which can be linked to climatic shifts, may have also played a role in altering marine habitats and ecosystems (Pier).\n\n3. **Volcanic Activity**: Large-scale volcanic eruptions during this period could have contributed to global cooling, further impacting marine life and ecosystems. The release of volcanic gases may have led to significant environmental changes that stressed marine organisms.\n\n4. **Sedimentation and Nutrient Runoff**: Excessive sedimentation from land, possibly due to increased erosion or changes in land use, could have smothered marine habitats. Additionally, massive nutrient runoff from continents may have led to algal blooms, which could deplete oxygen levels in the water.\n\n5. **Extraterrestrial Impacts**: Some hypotheses suggest that impacts from comets or asteroids could have contributed to the extinction events, similar to other mass extinctions in Earth's history (e.g., the Siljan Ring event in Sweden).\n\n6. **Multiple Extinction Pulses**: The extinction is marked by multiple pulses, including the Kellwasser event and the Hangenberg event, indicating that the crisis unfolded over an extended period rather than as a single catastrophic event.\n\nIn summary, the Devonian-Carboniferous extinction was likely the result of a combination of oceanic anoxia, climate change, volcanic activity, excessive sedimentation, nutrient runoff, and possibly extraterrestrial impacts, all contributing to a significant decline in biodiversity during this period.
