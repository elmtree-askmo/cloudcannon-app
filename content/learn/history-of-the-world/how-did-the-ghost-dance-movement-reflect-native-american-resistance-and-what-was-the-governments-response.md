    How did the Ghost Dance movement reflect Native American resistance, and what was the government's response?
answer: >-
    The Ghost Dance movement was a significant expression of Native American resistance during the late 19th century, particularly in response to the profound disruptions caused by U.S. expansion and colonization. This religious movement sought to restore traditional ways of life and bring about the return of the buffalo, which were central to the cultural and economic practices of many Native tribes. The Ghost Dance was characterized by communal gatherings that included singing, dancing, and religious observances, which aimed to foster a sense of unity and hope among Native peoples.\n\nThe U.S. government perceived the Ghost Dance as a potential threat, fearing it could incite a general uprising among Native Americans. This fear led to a militarized response, culminating in the tragic Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. During this event, U.S. soldiers opened fire on a group of Ghost Dancers encamped near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, resulting in the deaths of between 150 and 200 Native Americans, predominantly women and children. The massacre was met with widespread approval in the press at the time, and an Army Court of Inquiry largely exonerated the soldiers involved, with some even receiving the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\nThe government's response to the Ghost Dance movement and the subsequent massacre highlighted the broader context of U.S. policies aimed at suppressing Native American cultural practices and autonomy. It also underscored the limits of religious freedom for nonmainstream beliefs in the West, as federal authorities sought to control and eliminate what they viewed as threats to national stability. The Wounded Knee Massacre is often regarded as a pivotal moment that marked the end of large-scale Native American resistance to U.S. expansion, although small-scale resistance continued in various forms in the years that followed.
