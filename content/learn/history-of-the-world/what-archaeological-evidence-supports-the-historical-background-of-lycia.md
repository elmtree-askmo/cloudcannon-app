These tombs, often elaborately decorated, provide insights into the burial practices, social hierarchy, and artistic expressions of the Lycian people. The most famous of these is the Tomb of Amyntas in Fethiye, which showcases intricate carvings and a faÃ§ade resembling a temple.\n\n2. **Inscriptions**: Numerous inscriptions have been discovered in Lycia, including those in the Lycian language, which help scholars understand the region's history, governance, and cultural practices. These inscriptions often commemorate important figures and events, providing a direct link to the historical narrative of the area.\n\n3. **Urban Sites**: Excavations at ancient cities such as Xanthos, Patara, and Myra have revealed well-preserved remains of urban settlements, including public buildings, temples, and theaters.
