    What was the public's reaction to Noli Me Tangere when it was first published?
answer: >-
    The public's reaction to JosÃ© Rizal's novel "Noli Me Tangere" upon its first publication in 1887 was mixed, reflecting the complex socio-political landscape of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. \n\nInitially, the novel garnered significant attention and was praised for its literary merit and its bold critique of the social injustices and corruption prevalent in Philippine society. Rizal's portrayal of characters like Maria Clara and Sisa resonated with readers, highlighting the plight of Filipinos under colonial rule and the oppressive influence of the Spanish Catholic friars. The novel's themes of social injustice and national consciousness struck a chord with many, contributing to its popularity among the educated class, particularly the ilustrados, who were advocating for reform and greater rights for Filipinos.\n\nHowever, the reaction was not universally positive. The novel faced severe criticism from conservative sectors, including the Spanish authorities and the Catholic Church. Prominent figures, such as Fr. Salvador Font, issued official censure against the book, labeling it as a mortal sin to read. Critics like Vicente Barrantes described Rizal as a man of contradictions, arguing that his criticisms were an insult to Filipinos themselves. This backlash extended beyond the Philippines, with attacks on Rizal's work also occurring in Madrid.\n\nDespite the controversy, "Noli Me Tangere" played a crucial role in galvanizing Filipino nationalism and is considered a seminal work in Philippine literature. Its impact has endured, influencing political thought and inspiring movements for independence from Spanish rule. The novel's ability to articulate the frustrations and aspirations of the Filipino people solidified its place as a cornerstone of Philippine literary and historical discourse.
