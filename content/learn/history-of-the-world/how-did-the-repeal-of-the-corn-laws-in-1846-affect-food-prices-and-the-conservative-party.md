    How did the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 affect food prices and the Conservative Party?
answer: >-
    The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 had significant implications for both food prices and the Conservative Party in Britain.\n\n1. **Impact on Food Prices**: The Corn Laws were tariffs and trade restrictions that kept the prices of domestic grain high by limiting the import of cheaper foreign grain. Their repeal, led by Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, marked a major victory for free trade advocates. This action resulted in a substantial decrease in food prices, particularly bread, which was a staple for the working class. Lower food prices alleviated some of the economic pressures faced by the working population, especially during a time when the country was grappling with the effects of the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1852), which had led to widespread starvation and emigration in Ireland.\n\n2. **Impact on the Conservative Party**: The repeal of the Corn Laws also had profound political consequences. It caused a significant split within the Conservative Party, as many members opposed Peel's decision to support free trade over protectionist policies that favored agricultural interests. This division was exacerbated when Peel was defeated on the second reading of an Irish Coercion Bill aimed at addressing the violence stemming from the famine. Following this defeat, Peel resigned as Prime Minister just days later. The internal conflict within the party weakened its cohesion and led to a shift in political dynamics, paving the way for the rise of the Liberal Party and altering the landscape of British politics in the years that followed.\n\nIn summary, the repeal of the Corn Laws not only lowered food prices, benefiting the working class, but also led to a significant rift within the Conservative Party, ultimately contributing to changes in the political landscape of Victorian Britain.
