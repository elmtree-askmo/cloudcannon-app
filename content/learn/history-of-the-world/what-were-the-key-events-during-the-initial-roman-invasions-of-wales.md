    What were the key events during the initial Roman invasions of Wales?
answer: >-
    The initial Roman invasions of Wales were marked by several key events that unfolded between 48 AD and 78 AD. Hereâ€™s a summary of these significant occurrences:\n\n1. **Beginning of the Invasion (48 AD)**: The Roman invasion of Wales commenced in 48 AD, shortly after the Romans began their broader conquest of Britain in 43 AD. The imperial governor of Roman Britain led the military campaign into the region.\n\n2. **Crossing the River Dee**: The first major military action involved crossing the River Dee, which aimed to separate the tribes of the highlands of Wales from those in the north of what would later become England. This strategic move was crucial for the Romans to establish control over the region.\n\n3. **Resistance from Native Tribes**: The tribes in Wales, known for their fierce resistance, did not surrender easily. The Romans faced significant opposition from various tribal groups, which prolonged the conquest. The native warriors were well-prepared and fought valiantly against the invading forces.\n\n4. **Completion of Conquest (78 AD)**: The Roman conquest of Wales was completed by 78 AD. This marked the establishment of Roman military forts, fortlets, and roads throughout the region, facilitating control and integration into the Roman Empire. The only town founded by the Romans in Wales was Caerwent, located in South Wales.\n\n5. **Military Occupation**: Following the conquest, Roman rule in Wales was characterized primarily by military occupation, lasting until around 383 AD. The Romans built infrastructure, including roads that connected military sites and settlements, which contributed to the Romanization of the area, particularly in the southern coastal regions.\n\n6. **Tacitus' Accounts**: The historian Tacitus provides some of the few written records from this period, documenting the conflicts and the eventual subjugation of the native tribes. His writings highlight the challenges faced by the Romans and the resistance they encountered.\n\nOverall, the Roman invasions of Wales were a complex series of military campaigns that transformed the region, leading to significant changes in its social and political landscape.
