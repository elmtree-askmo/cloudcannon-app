    What military actions have been taken in the recent Israel-Hezbollah conflict?
answer: >-
    The recent Israel-Hezbollah conflict, which escalated significantly following the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has involved a series of military actions from both sides. Here are some key military developments:\n\n1. **Initial Hostilities**: The conflict began on October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah launched rocket strikes into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. In response, Israel returned fire, marking the start of a series of exchanges.\n\n2. **Israeli Military Operations**: The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have conducted extensive military operations, including airstrikes targeting Hezbollah infrastructure such as headquarters, storage facilities, and missile launchers. The IDF has also engaged in ground operations, with reports of close-quarters battles against Hezbollah units.\n\n3. **Casualties and Damage**: The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, with over 3,700 people reported killed in Lebanon and around 80 in northern Israel. The IDF has reported the deaths of twelve Israeli soldiers since the start of the operation.\n\n4. **Hezbollah's Counterattacks**: Hezbollah has claimed to have attacked multiple IDF military sites using missiles and artillery. They have also employed drones in their operations, marking a new phase in their military engagement. Notably, Hezbollah shot down an Israeli drone over Lebanese territory and has conducted anti-tank missile attacks that resulted in Israeli casualties.\n\n5. **International Involvement and Ceasefire**: The conflict has drawn international attention, leading to diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. A ceasefire was announced to take effect on a specified date, with plans for both Israeli and Hezbollah forces to withdraw from the border area over a 60-day period.\n\n6. **Ongoing Tensions**: Despite the ceasefire, tensions remain high, with both sides maintaining military readiness. The situation is complicated by the involvement of other regional powers and the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nThese military actions reflect the complex and volatile nature of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, which has deep historical roots and is influenced by broader regional dynamics.
