    What is the Everglades Caucus and how was it formed?
answer: >-
    The Everglades Caucus is a bipartisan group formed by members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida, aimed at promoting legislation that secures long-term funding for projects related to the restoration and preservation of the Everglades ecosystem. The Caucus was officially launched during the 118th Congress, co-chaired by Representatives Mario DÃ­az-Balart (R-FL-26) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL-25). \n\nThe formation of the Everglades Caucus reflects the recognition of Everglades restoration as a critical issue that transcends party lines, with both state and federal representatives coming together to advocate for the unique ecological and environmental needs of the region. The Caucus serves to educate Congress members and their staff on the significant issues impacting the Everglades and to generate support for necessary projects and funding.\n\nFounded in 2006, the Caucus has played a vital role in ensuring that the Everglades receives the attention and resources it requires for restoration efforts, including initiatives like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which is the largest environmental restoration effort in history. The Caucus continues to be instrumental in advocating for vital funding and legislative support to protect this unique ecosystem.
