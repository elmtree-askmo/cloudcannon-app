    How has the understanding of continental drift evolved over time?
answer: >-
    The understanding of continental drift has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 20th century. The concept was first fully articulated by German meteorologist and geophysicist Alfred Wegener in 1912. Wegener proposed that the continents were once part of a single supercontinent, known as Pangaea, which began to break apart approximately 240 million years ago. His hypothesis was based on several lines of evidence, including the fit of continental coastlines, similarities in fossil records across continents, and geological features such as mountain ranges that appeared to align when continents were brought together.\n\nInitially, Wegener's ideas were met with skepticism and were largely rejected by the geological community. Critics argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the notion of continents drifting through the solid oceanic crust. Alternative theories, such as the existence of land bridges, were proposed to explain the distribution of fossils and geological similarities.\n\nThe theory of continental drift began to gain traction in the 1950s and 1960s, largely due to advancements in seismology and oceanography. The exploration of the ocean floor revealed mid-ocean ridges and provided evidence for seafloor spreading, which supported the idea that tectonic plates were moving. This led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics, which integrated continental drift into a broader framework explaining the movement of the Earth's lithosphere.\n\nKey contributions during this period included the work of geophysicist Harry H. Hess, who proposed that new oceanic crust is generated at oceanic ridges, and Arthur Holmes, who suggested that convection currents in the Earth's mantle could drive the movement of continents. By the 1960s, the accumulation of geological, paleontological, and geophysical evidence led to a paradigm shift, establishing continental drift as a fundamental aspect of modern geology.\n\nToday, the understanding of continental drift is crucial for reconstructing the Earth's paleogeography, which has implications for climate, sea-level changes, and the history of the Earth's magnetic field. The theory has reshaped our understanding of geological processes, revealing the dynamic nature of the Earth's surface and the continuous movement of tectonic plates.
