    What was the Missouri Compromise, and how did it attempt to address the issue of slavery in new territories?
answer: >-
    The Missouri Compromise, enacted in 1820, was a significant legislative agreement aimed at addressing the contentious issue of slavery in the United States, particularly in relation to new territories acquired through the Louisiana Purchase. This compromise was a response to the growing sectional tensions between the North and the South regarding the expansion of slavery.\n\nKey components of the Missouri Compromise included:\n\n1. **Admission of States**: The compromise allowed Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state while simultaneously admitting Maine as a free state. This dual admission was crucial for maintaining the balance of power between slave and free states in Congress, particularly in the Senate and the Electoral College.\n\n2. **Geographical Boundaries**: The Missouri Compromise established the 36°30' latitude line as a boundary. It prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of this line, with the exception of Missouri itself. This provision aimed to limit the expansion of slavery into new territories and set a precedent for future territorial governance.\n\n3. **Temporary Resolution**: While the Missouri Compromise temporarily alleviated tensions, it was ultimately a short-term solution. It confirmed the principle that slavery could expand into new states, which was seen as a victory for slaveholders. The compromise held for 34 years until it was repealed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, and in 1857, the Supreme Court ruled the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case.\n\nIn summary, the Missouri Compromise was a critical attempt to balance the interests of slave and free states during a period of increasing sectional conflict, setting important precedents for the future of slavery in the United States.
