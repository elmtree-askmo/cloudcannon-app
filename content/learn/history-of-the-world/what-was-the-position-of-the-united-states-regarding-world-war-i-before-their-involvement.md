    What was the position of the United States regarding World War I before their involvement?
answer: >-
    Before the United States entered World War I, it maintained a position of neutrality, which was formally proclaimed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 4, 1914, shortly after the war began in Europe. This stance was largely supported by the American public, who favored avoiding entanglement in foreign conflicts. Wilson emphasized the importance of remaining "impartial in thought as well as in action," reflecting a long-standing American foreign policy tradition of avoiding alliances and conflicts that did not directly involve the nation.\n\nDespite this official neutrality, the U.S. was not entirely uninvolved. American organizations and individuals engaged in various forms of support for the Allies, including fundraising and volunteer efforts. Additionally, the U.S. economy benefited from trade with the Allied powers, particularly the United Kingdom and France, which created a complex relationship between American neutrality and economic interests.\n\nPublic opinion began to shift as the war progressed, particularly due to events such as Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, which threatened American shipping and lives. The sinking of U.S. merchant ships by German U-boats, along with Germany's attempts to entice Mexico into an alliance against the United States, ultimately contributed to the U.S. decision to enter the war in April 1917. On April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, which was granted on April 6, 1917, marking the end of U.S. neutrality in the conflict. \n\nIn summary, the United States initially adopted a neutral stance in World War I, driven by a desire to avoid foreign entanglements, but economic interests and aggressive actions by Germany gradually shifted public opinion and policy towards eventual involvement in the war.
