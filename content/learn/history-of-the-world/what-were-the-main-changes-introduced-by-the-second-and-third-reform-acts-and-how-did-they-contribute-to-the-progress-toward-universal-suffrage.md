answer: >-
    The Second and Third Reform Acts were pivotal in the evolution of voting rights in Britain, contributing significantly to the movement towards universal suffrage.\n\n### Second Reform Act (1867)\nThe Second Reform Act was a landmark legislation that expanded the electorate by allowing many working-class men in urban areas to vote. This act effectively doubled the number of eligible voters, marking a crucial step towards broader democratic participation. However, it is important to note that while the act increased the electorate, it did not achieve universal male suffrage, as many men, particularly those in rural areas and the lower classes, remained disenfranchised.\n\n### Third Reform Act (1884)\nThe Third Reform Act further extended voting rights, this time to rural men, again doubling the electorate. This act was significant as it addressed the disparities between urban and rural voting rights, thereby promoting a more inclusive electoral system. Like its predecessor, the Third Reform Act did not establish universal male suffrage, but it was a critical advancement in the ongoing struggle for broader voting rights.\n\n### Contribution to Universal Suffrage\nBoth acts were part of a larger movement towards universal suffrage in Britain. They laid the groundwork for future reforms by progressively dismantling the property qualifications that had previously restricted voting rights. The expansion of the electorate through these acts highlighted the growing demand for democratic representation among the working classes and set the stage for further reforms in the early 20th century, ultimately leading to the Representation of the People Act 1918, which granted voting rights to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30.\n\nIn summary, the Second and Third Reform Acts were instrumental in the gradual progression towards universal suffrage, reflecting the changing social and political landscape of Victorian Britain.
