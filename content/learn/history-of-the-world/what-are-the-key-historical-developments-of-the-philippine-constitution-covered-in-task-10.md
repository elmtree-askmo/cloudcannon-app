    What are the key historical developments of the Philippine Constitution covered in Task 10?
answer: >-
    The key historical developments of the Philippine Constitution, as covered in Task 10, include a comprehensive overview of the evolution of various constitutions from the late 19th century to the present day. Here are the significant milestones:\n\n1. **Biak-na-Bato Constitution (1897)**: This was the first constitution of the Philippines, established during the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule. It aimed to create a revolutionary government but was short-lived due to the conflict's stalemate.\n\n2. **Malolos Constitution (1899)**: Following the declaration of Philippine independence, the Malolos Constitution was ratified, marking the establishment of the First Philippine Republic. It was notable for its democratic principles and separation of powers but was ultimately rendered ineffective due to the Philippine-American War.\n\n3. **Organic Acts (1902-1935)**: During American colonial rule, several Organic Acts were enacted, which served as constitutions. These included the Philippine Commission's laws that established a limited form of self-governance.\n\n4. **1935 Constitution**: This constitution was ratified under the Commonwealth of the Philippines and established a presidential system of government. It included provisions for civil liberties and the separation of powers, and it was amended in 1940 and 1947 to address various governance issues.\n\n5. **1943 Constitution**: During the Japanese occupation in World War II, a new constitution was promulgated, which was heavily influenced by the Japanese government. It was short-lived and was not recognized after the war.\n\n6. **1973 Constitution**: This constitution was enacted during the martial law period under President Ferdinand Marcos. It introduced a parliamentary system and allowed for the extension of Marcos's rule, but it faced criticism for its authoritarian provisions.\n\n7. **1987 Constitution**: Following the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos, the 1987 Constitution was ratified. It restored democratic governance, emphasized human rights, and included provisions for checks and balances among the branches of government. This constitution remains in effect today.\n\nThese developments reflect the Philippines' struggle for independence, the influence of foreign powers, and the ongoing quest for democratic governance. The historical context of each constitution highlights the socio-political challenges faced by the nation throughout its history. Additionally, discussions around potential constitutional reforms continue to be relevant in contemporary Philippine politics.
