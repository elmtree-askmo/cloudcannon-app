    How did Jacob Riis's background influence his work as a muckraker?
answer: >-
    Jacob Riis's background significantly influenced his work as a muckraker, shaping his perspective on urban poverty and social reform. Born on May 3, 1849, in Ribe, Denmark, Riis immigrated to the United States at the age of 20, driven by aspirations for a better life and the hope of marrying his teenage love. His early years in America were marked by hardship; he struggled to find steady employment, working various labor-intensive jobs such as a farmhand, ironworker, and carpenter. This firsthand experience of poverty and the challenges faced by immigrants deeply informed his later work.\n\nRiis's career began in journalism when he took a non-paying job with a failing New York City newspaper, which eventually led him to become a police reporter for The New York Tribune. In this role, he was exposed to the grim realities of life in the slums, which he documented through both writing and photography. His seminal work, "How the Other Half Lives," published in 1890, was groundbreaking in its use of photojournalism to reveal the squalid living conditions of New York City's poor, particularly immigrants. This book not only shocked readers but also laid the foundation for muckraking journalism, highlighting the urgent need for social reform.\n\nRiis's background as an immigrant and his struggles with poverty allowed him to empathize with the plight of the urban poor, motivating him to advocate for better housing and living conditions. His writings and lectures emphasized the themes of urban poverty and social justice, making a lasting impact on American society and prompting legislative reforms aimed at improving public health and sanitation. Through his innovative use of photography and compelling prose, Riis became a pivotal figure in the Progressive Era, using his experiences to drive social change and raise awareness about the conditions faced by the less fortunate.
