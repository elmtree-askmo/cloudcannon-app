    What were the main military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles?
answer: >-
    The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, imposed several significant military restrictions on Germany, aimed at preventing the nation from waging war again. The main military restrictions included:\n\n1. **Army Size Limitation**: The German army was limited to a maximum of 100,000 troops. This drastic reduction was intended to weaken Germany's military capabilities.\n\n2. **Navy Restrictions**: The German Navy was restricted to only 6 ships, and the country was prohibited from having submarines.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Tanks and Aircraft**: Germany was banned from possessing tanks and military aircraft, which were essential for modern warfare.\n\n4. **Demilitarization of the Rhineland**: The Rhineland, a region bordering France, was to be demilitarized. This meant that no German military forces could be stationed there, further limiting Germany's ability to defend itself or launch an offensive.\n\n5. **Prohibition of Alliances**: Germany was forbidden from forming alliances with Austria, which was seen as a potential threat to the stability of Europe.\n\nThese restrictions were part of a broader strategy to ensure that Germany could not initiate another conflict on the scale of World War I. However, they also contributed to a sense of humiliation and vulnerability among the German populace, fostering resentment that would later be exploited by political movements, including the rise of the Nazi Party.
