    What was the media coverage like following the assassinations and the trial?
answer: >-
    Following the assassinations of Harvey Milk and George Moscone on November 27, 1978, media coverage was extensive and immediate, reflecting the shock and outrage felt by the public. KPFA, a local radio station, dedicated a significant portion of their news program to the event, featuring Dianne Feinstein's announcement of the deaths to a stunned audience. This coverage included reports from journalists like Leely Franklin, who provided updates on the situation as it unfolded.\n\nIn addition to radio coverage, television also played a crucial role in disseminating information. KQED aired a special live program hosted by Belva Davis on the night of the murders, which included discussions with prominent figures such as Willie Brown. This program highlighted the emotional and political ramifications of the assassinations, as well as the memorial services that followed.\n\nThe trial of Dan White, who was charged with the murders, attracted significant media attention as well. The unique aspects of the case, including the controversial "Twinkie Defense," where White's defense team argued that his consumption of junk food indicated a diminished capacity for judgment, further fueled public interest. The trial was marked by intense scrutiny, with many questioning whether political motivations and societal attitudes towards homosexuality influenced the jury's decision.\n\nThe verdict, which resulted in White being convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, sparked outrage within the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. This public reaction culminated in the White Night Riot on May 21, 1979, where thousands took to the streets in protest against the perceived leniency of the verdict. The media coverage of the riots further highlighted the tensions surrounding the case and the broader socio-political climate of the time.\n\nOverall, the media coverage following the assassinations and the trial was characterized by a mix of shock, outrage, and a deep examination of the political and social issues at play, significantly impacting public discourse and the rise of the gay rights movement in San Francisco and beyond.
