    What specific military actions has Israel taken in the recent Gaza conflict?
answer: >-
    In the recent Gaza conflict, Israel has undertaken a series of significant military actions following the initial Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) began with extensive airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, targeting various locations, including residential buildings, which resulted in substantial casualties among the Palestinian population. Reports indicate that hundreds of Palestinians were killed in a single day due to these airstrikes, and many medical facilities were severely damaged or shut down due to the ongoing bombardment and lack of power.\n\nOn October 13, 2023, Israel escalated its military operations by initiating ground operations in Gaza. By October 27, a full-scale invasion was launched, with the IDF stating that it was expanding ground operations and operating forcefully on all fronts. The military's stated objectives include the destruction of Hamas, the freeing of hostages, and ensuring the security of Israel.\n\nThe IDF has also been involved in intense fighting in specific areas, such as Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah, where ground troops have engaged in combat operations. The military has reported that it is conducting a thorough review of its operations, particularly in response to incidents where civilian shelters were hit, raising concerns about the safety of non-combatants in the conflict.\n\nOverall, the military actions taken by Israel in the Gaza conflict have been characterized by a combination of airstrikes and ground operations aimed at dismantling Hamas's capabilities while facing significant international scrutiny regarding the humanitarian impact of these operations.
