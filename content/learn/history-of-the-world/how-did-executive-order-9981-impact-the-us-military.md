answer: >-
    Executive Order 9981, signed by President Harry S. Truman on July 26, 1948, had a profound impact on the U.S. military by mandating the desegregation of the armed forces. This executive order declared that "there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed forces without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin." It established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, commonly known as the Fahy Committee, to oversee the implementation of this policy and recommend necessary revisions to military regulations.\n\nBefore the enactment of Executive Order 9981, the U.S. military was racially segregated, which reflected broader societal norms of discrimination and inequality. The order was a significant victory for African American activists and civil rights leaders who had long fought for equal treatment within the military. It was particularly notable as it came in the wake of national attention on the violence against Black veterans returning from World War II, which highlighted the urgent need for change.\n\nThe order faced considerable resistance, particularly from Southern military leaders who were concerned about its potential impact on enlistments and morale. For instance, Kenneth Royall, the Secretary of the Army at the time, expressed apprehension about the order's effects. However, Truman was determined to see full desegregation and took steps to ensure compliance, including forcing Royall into retirement when he refused to support the order.\n\nThe implementation of Executive Order 9981 marked a turning point in the military, as it began to reflect a more inclusive society. Over the ensuing decades, the military became a site of opportunity for Black Americans and other minorities, contributing to the broader civil rights movement. The order is often regarded as a cornerstone of racial integration in the military and a significant milestone in the struggle for civil rights in the United States.
