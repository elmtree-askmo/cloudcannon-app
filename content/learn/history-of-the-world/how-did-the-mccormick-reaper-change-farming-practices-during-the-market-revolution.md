answer: >-
    The McCormick Reaper, invented by Cyrus McCormick in 1831 and patented in 1834, significantly transformed farming practices during the Market Revolution. This innovative machine mechanized the harvesting of grain crops, which had previously been a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. \n\nBefore the introduction of the reaper, farmers relied heavily on manual labor, using scythes to cut grain. A skilled worker could only harvest about two acres of grain in a day. The McCormick Reaper, however, allowed farmers to harvest much larger areas in a fraction of the time. It was horse-drawn and capable of cutting six acres of oats in just one afternoon, drastically reducing the amount of manual labor required.\n\nThe advantages of the McCormick Reaper were profound. It improved efficiency and productivity on farms, enabling farmers to harvest more grain with less labor. This increase in productivity laid the groundwork for further agricultural innovations and facilitated larger-scale farming operations. As a result, the reaper contributed to the westward expansion of the United States by making it feasible to cultivate vast tracts of land that were previously difficult to farm.\n\nOverall, the McCormick Reaper played a crucial role in the agricultural transformation during the Market Revolution, marking a shift towards mechanization in farming that would shape the future of agriculture in America.
