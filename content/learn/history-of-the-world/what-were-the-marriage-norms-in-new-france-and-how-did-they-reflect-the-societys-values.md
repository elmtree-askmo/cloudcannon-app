    What were the marriage norms in New France, and how did they reflect the society's values?
answer: >-
    In New France, marriage norms were deeply influenced by the societal values of the time, particularly the Catholic Church's teachings and the need for population growth in the colony. The institution of marriage was seen as a vital component of family life, which was central to the social structure of New France.\n\n### Marriage Contracts\nMarriage in New France often began with a marriage contract, which was a legal promise to marry in the Catholic Church. This contract outlined the rights and responsibilities of both parties and was a formal step in the marriage process. The Custom of Paris, a set of civil laws from France, governed these contracts and was applied in New France, reflecting the legal traditions of the French homeland.\n\n### Role of Women\nWomen played a crucial role in the marriage dynamic. The most significant role for women in New France was that of a wife and mother. The Filles du Roi, or King's Daughters, were a group of approximately 700 unmarried women sent to New France between 1663 and 1673 to address the gender imbalance and promote family formation. Many of these women entered into marriage contracts, and records indicate that a substantial number of them married shortly after their arrival, contributing to the colony's demographic growth.\n\n### Family and Child-Rearing\nMarriage norms emphasized the importance of family, with women primarily responsible for managing the household and raising children. The high mortality rates among children and mothers during childbirth underscored the challenges faced by families in the colony. Despite these hardships, the family unit was a source of support and stability, reflecting the values of community and cooperation that were essential for survival in the harsh conditions of early Canada.\n\n### Legal Protections\nThe legal framework provided some protections for women within marriage. For instance, Bishop Saint-Vallier noted that while the marriage bond was indissoluble, judicial decisions could allow for separation regarding living arrangements and property. This indicates that women had certain rights, albeit limited, within the marriage institution.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the marriage norms in New France reflected a society that valued family, community, and the continuation of cultural and religious traditions. The emphasis on marriage as a means of establishing stable family units was crucial for the survival and growth of the colony, and the roles assigned to men and women within this framework were indicative of the broader gender roles of the time.
