    When was "Night" originally published, and what was its initial reception?
answer: >-
    "Night" was originally published in Yiddish in 1956 under the title "Un di velt hot geshvign" ("And the World Remained Silent"). The French translation, titled "La Nuit," was published in 1958, and the English version, translated by Stella Rodway, was published in 1960 by Hill & Wang. \n\nInitially, the reception of "Night" was modest; in the first 18 months, only 1,046 copies were sold at $3 each, and it took three years to sell the first print run of 3,000 copies. However, the book gradually attracted interest from reviewers, which led to television interviews and engagements with notable literary figures, such as Saul Bellow. This growing recognition helped to elevate the book's status and solidify its importance in Holocaust literature. \n\nWiesel wrote "Night" to break the silence surrounding the Holocaust and ensure that the atrocities were not forgotten, making it a significant work in both literary and historical contexts.
