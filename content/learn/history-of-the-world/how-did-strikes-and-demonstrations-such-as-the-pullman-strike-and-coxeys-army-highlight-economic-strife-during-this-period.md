    Strikes and demonstrations during the Gilded Age, such as the Pullman Strike and Coxey's Army, were significant indicators of the economic strife that characterized this period. These events highlighted the struggles faced by workers and the broader economic challenges affecting various segments of society.\n\n### Pullman Strike\n\nThe Pullman Strike of 1894 was a pivotal labor action that began when workers at the Pullman Company, which manufactured luxury railroad cars, went on strike due to wage cuts and high rents in company-owned housing. The strike escalated when the American Railway Union, led by Eugene V. Debs, supported the Pullman workers by boycotting trains that carried Pullman cars. This action effectively crippled the national rail service, leading to widespread disruptions in transportation and commerce.\n\nThe federal government's response was swift and severe; President Grover Cleveland sent federal troops to break the strike, citing the disruption of mail delivery as justification. This intervention not only underscored the tensions between labor and government but also highlighted the desperation of workers facing economic hardship. The Pullman Strike drew national attention to the plight of workers and the growing divide between the wealthy elite and the working class.\n\n### Coxey's Army\n\nCoxey's Army, led by Jacob Coxey in 1894, was another significant demonstration of economic strife. This group of unemployed men marched to Washington, D.C., demanding economic relief and the creation of jobs through public works programs. Their march symbolized the frustrations of many Americans who were suffering from the effects of the economic depression, including high unemployment and poverty.\n\nCoxey's Army aimed to bring attention to the need for government intervention in the economy, advocating for policies that would provide relief to the unemployed. Although the march did not achieve its immediate goals, it highlighted the growing discontent among the working class and the demand for economic reform.\n\n### Socio-Economic Context\n\nBoth the Pullman Strike and Coxey's Army were manifestations of the broader economic strife during the Gilded Age, characterized by:\n\n- **Economic Inequality**: The era saw a stark contrast between the wealth of industrialists and the struggles of workers. While the economy was booming for some, many workers faced long hours, unsafe working conditions, and stagnant wages.\n- **Labor Movements**: These strikes were part of a larger trend of labor activism, as workers organized to demand better conditions and wages. The rise of labor unions during this period was a direct response to the economic challenges faced by workers.\n- **Political Corruption and Reform**: The influence of big businesses on government policies often left workers feeling powerless. Strikes and demonstrations were ways for workers to assert their demands and push for political change.\n\nIn summary, the Pullman Strike and Coxey's Army were critical events that illustrated the economic strife of the Gilded Age. They reflected the frustrations of workers and the need for reform in a rapidly changing economic landscape, ultimately contributing to the rise of labor movements and calls for government intervention in the economy.
