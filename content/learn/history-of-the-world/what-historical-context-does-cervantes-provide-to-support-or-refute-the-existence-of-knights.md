    What historical context does Cervantes provide to support or refute the existence of knights?
answer: >-
    In "Don Quixote," Miguel de Cervantes provides a rich historical context that both supports and critiques the existence of knights in early modern Spain. The novel is set against the backdrop of a Spain that had recently completed the Reconquista, a period marked by the unification of Christian kingdoms and the expulsion of Muslim rule. This historical moment is significant as it reflects a society grappling with its identity and the remnants of chivalric traditions that were once celebrated.\n\nCervantes illustrates the waning reality of knights through the character of Don Quixote, who is an aging hidalgoâ€”one of the lowest ranks of the Spanish nobility. His delusions of grandeur and commitment to knight-errantry highlight the absurdity of clinging to outdated ideals in a rapidly changing world. The novel serves as a critique of the Spanish class system, as Quixote's noble status does not afford him the wealth or influence typically associated with knighthood. Instead, he is portrayed as a figure of mockery, embodying the folly of pursuing a chivalric code that has lost its relevance.\n\nMoreover, Cervantes contrasts Don Quixote's lofty aspirations with the grounded perspective of his squire, Sancho Panza. Sancho, a peasant, provides a voice of reason and humor, often questioning the practicality of Quixote's quests. This dynamic illustrates the divide between the idealized notions of knighthood and the harsh realities of everyday life in Spain. Through their adventures, Cervantes critiques the romanticized view of knights and highlights the absurdity of Quixote's pursuits, such as fighting windmills he believes to be giants.\n\nAdditionally, Cervantes reflects on the cultural nostalgia for chivalric legends, suggesting that while the actual existence of knights may have diminished, their stories and ideals still held sway over the Spanish imagination. This interplay between reality and fiction in "Don Quixote" serves to question the validity of the knightly ethos in a society that is evolving beyond its medieval roots.\n\nIn summary, Cervantes uses the historical context of early modern Spain to both support and refute the existence of knights. He acknowledges the cultural legacy of chivalry while simultaneously critiquing its impracticality and irrelevance in contemporary society, as embodied by the character of Don Quixote and his relationship with Sancho Panza.
