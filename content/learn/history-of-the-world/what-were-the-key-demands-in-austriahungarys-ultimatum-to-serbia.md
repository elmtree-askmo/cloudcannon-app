    What were the key demands in Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia?
answer: >-
    On July 23, 1914, Austria-Hungary issued a rigid ultimatum to Serbia, which included a series of ten demands that were intended to be unacceptable to provoke a conflict. The key demands of the ultimatum included:\n\n1. **Official Condemnation**: Serbia was required to officially condemn the propaganda against Austria-Hungary and to suppress any efforts aimed at separating territories from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.\n\n2. **Suppression of Anti-Austrian Activities**: The Serbian government was to take steps to eliminate any anti-Austrian propaganda from public instruction and to prevent any further activities that could be seen as promoting such sentiments.\n\n3. **Cooperation with Investigations**: Austria-Hungary demanded that Serbia allow Austro-Hungarian officials to participate in the investigation of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which was carried out by a Bosnian Serb nationalist.\n\n4. **Arrest of Individuals**: Serbia was to arrest and prosecute individuals involved in the assassination and those who were part of the nationalist movement that threatened Austro-Hungarian interests.\n\n5. **Public Assurance**: The Serbian government was required to provide assurances that it would take all necessary measures to prevent any future acts of terrorism against Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe ultimatum was presented with a 48-hour deadline for a response, and it was crafted in such a way that it was likely to be rejected by Serbia, thereby providing Austria-Hungary with a pretext for military action. Ultimately, Serbia's response was conciliatory but did not fully comply with all demands, leading to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia on July 28, 1914, which marked the beginning of World War I.
