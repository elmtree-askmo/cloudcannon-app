    What were the key policies of the Harding Administration?
answer: >-
    The Harding Administration, which lasted from 1921 until Harding's death in 1923, was characterized by several key policies that aimed to promote economic growth and reduce government intervention in the economy. Here are the main policies of the Harding Administration:\n\n1. **Return to Normalcy**: Harding campaigned on a platform that promised a "return to normalcy," which resonated with the American public's desire to move away from the progressive reforms and internationalism of the Wilson administration. This approach emphasized stability and a focus on domestic issues.\n\n2. **Pro-Business Economic Policies**: The Harding Administration adopted a pro-business stance, moving away from the regulatory policies of the Progressive Era. This included a focus on deregulation and fostering an environment conducive to business growth.\n\n3. **Tax Cuts**: Under the influence of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, Harding implemented significant tax cuts aimed at stimulating the economy. The top income tax rate was reduced from 73% to 40% and later to 25%, which was intended to encourage investment and spending.\n\n4. **Fiscal Conservatism**: The administration executed sharp reductions in government spending, decreasing expenditures from approximately $5.5 billion to $3.7 billion over three years. This fiscal conservatism was part of a broader effort to reduce the size of government and limit its role in the economy.\n\n5. **Emergency Tariff Act of 1921**: This act was designed to provide temporary relief to U.S. farmers suffering from post-war economic downturns. It imposed tariffs on agricultural imports to protect domestic farmers.\n\n6. **Isolationist Foreign Policy**: While Harding sought to engage with international bodies, he faced opposition from isolationist forces in the Senate. His administration ultimately did not participate in the Paris peace agreements, signaling a retreat from Wilsonian internationalism.\n\n7. **Scandals and Corruption**: The Harding Administration was marred by scandals, most notably the Teapot Dome scandal, which involved the secret leasing of federal oil reserves. These scandals overshadowed many of the administration's policies and contributed to a perception of corruption.\n\nOverall, the Harding Administration's policies laid the groundwork for the economic landscape of the 1920s, characterized by a focus on business interests, tax reductions, and a limited role for government in economic affairs. These policies would continue to influence the subsequent administration of Calvin Coolidge.
