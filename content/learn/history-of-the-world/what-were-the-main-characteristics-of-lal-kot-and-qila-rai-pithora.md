    Lal Kot, also known as Qila Rai Pithora, is a significant historical fortification located in present-day Delhi. It was constructed during the reign of the Rajput Tomar ruler Anangpal Tomar between approximately 1052 and 1060 CE. Here are the main characteristics of both Lal Kot and Qila Rai Pithora:\n\n### Lal Kot\n1. **Size and Structure**: Lal Kot was a large fortification, spanning three and a half kilometers with an uneven oblong shape. The walls of the fort were notably high, comparable to those of Tughlaqabad, and the rampart walls were 20 to 30 feet thick.\n2. **Architectural Significance**: It is recognized as the first Red Fort of Delhi, constructed primarily from red stone. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Islamic influences, indicative of the cultural transitions occurring during its construction.\n3. **Historical Context**: Lal Kot is often referred to as the "First city of Delhi." It served as a strategic fortification for the Tomar rulers, who shifted their capital from Surajkund to Mehrauli, also known as Yognipura, to secure their territory.\n4. **Current State**: Although now in ruins, remnants of the fort walls can still be seen scattered across South Delhi, particularly in areas like Saket and Mehrauli, contributing to the Mehrauli Archaeological Park.\n\n### Qila Rai Pithora\n1. **Expansion and Renovation**: After the Tomar dynasty, the Chauhan king Prithvi Raj Chauhan conquered Delhi in 1180 and expanded Lal Kot, renaming it Qila Rai Pithora. This fortification became a significant example of the legacy of the Chauhan dynasty in India.\n2. **Defensive Role**: Qila Rai Pithora played a crucial role in the defense of the region, especially during the period of the Delhi Sultanate. It was occupied by a predominantly Muslim garrison and was part of an extensive series of fortifications in the area.\n3. **Historical Events**: The fort faced significant challenges, including severe damage during the invasion of Timur in 1398, which marked a pivotal moment in its history.\n\nIn summary, Lal Kot and Qila Rai Pithora represent important milestones in the historical development of Delhi, showcasing the architectural and cultural shifts that occurred over centuries. Their remnants today serve as a testament to the rich history of the region.
