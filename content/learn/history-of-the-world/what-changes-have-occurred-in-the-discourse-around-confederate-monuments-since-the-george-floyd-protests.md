    What changes have occurred in the discourse around Confederate monuments since the George Floyd protests?
answer: >-
    Since the George Floyd protests in May 2020, there has been a significant shift in the discourse surrounding Confederate monuments and symbols in the United States. The protests, which were sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, reignited a national conversation about racial injustice and the legacy of racism in American history, leading to widespread calls for the removal of Confederate statues and memorials.\n\n1. **Increased Removal of Monuments**: Following the protests, there was a notable increase in the removal of Confederate symbols. According to a survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center, over 160 Confederate symbols were taken down in 2020 alone, which was more than the total removed in the previous four years combined. This included statues of Confederate soldiers and generals, many of which were viewed as glorifying a history of slavery and racism.\n\n2. **Public Actions and Vandalism**: In many cities, protesters actively vandalized or tore down Confederate monuments. For instance, in Birmingham, Alabama, the Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument was targeted shortly after Floyd's death, with protesters spray painting and chipping at its base. Similarly, in Indianapolis, the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was dismantled on June 8, 2020.\n\n3. **Legislative Responses**: The protests also prompted legislative actions regarding the protection and removal of Confederate monuments. While some cities moved to remove these symbols, others voted to protect them, reflecting a divided public opinion on the issue. Reports indicated that there were votes or decisions to protect 28 monuments during this period.\n\n4. **Cultural and Historical Reassessment**: The discourse has shifted towards a broader reassessment of historical figures commemorated by these monuments. Many of the statues that were removed were associated with the "Lost Cause" narrative of the Confederacy, which downplays the role of slavery in the Civil War. The removal of these symbols has been framed as part of a larger movement to confront and address systemic racism in the United States.\n\n5. **Replacement and Commemoration**: In some instances, removed Confederate monuments have been replaced with tributes to civil rights figures. For example, a statue of John Lewis was erected in Georgia to replace a Confederate memorial, symbolizing a shift towards honoring those who fought for equality and justice.\n\nOverall, the George Floyd protests have catalyzed a significant transformation in how Confederate monuments are perceived and treated in public spaces, leading to a more critical examination of their historical context and purpose. The ongoing debate reflects broader societal changes regarding race, history, and memory in the United States.
