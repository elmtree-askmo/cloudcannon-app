    What were the main goals of the Knights of Labor during the labor movements of the Gilded Age?
answer: >-
    The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, emerged as one of the most significant labor organizations during the Gilded Age, reaching a peak membership of nearly 800,000 in 1886. Their main goals during the labor movements of this period included:\n\n1. **Wage Increases**: The Knights sought to secure fair wages that reflected the cost of living and the value of the work performed. They aimed to ensure that workers received compensation that was equitable and sustainable.\n\n2. **Shorter Workdays**: A primary objective was to advocate for reduced working hours, specifically pushing for an eight-hour workday as a standard. This was a response to the grueling hours many workers faced in factories and other industries.\n\n3. **Job Security**: The organization aimed to protect workers from arbitrary dismissal and to ensure stable employment. This included advocating for policies that would provide job security and protect workers' rights.\n\n4. **Collective Bargaining**: The Knights emphasized the importance of collective bargaining, allowing workers to negotiate as a group with employers rather than as individuals. This was seen as a way to strengthen their negotiating power and improve working conditions.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Diverse Workers**: The Knights of Labor aimed to include all workers, regardless of skill level, gender, or race, in their ranks. This inclusive approach reflected a broader vision of labor solidarity, although they did exclude certain groups, such as Asian immigrants on the West Coast.\n\n6. **Political and Social Reform**: Beyond immediate labor issues, the Knights sought broader social reforms, including the establishment of a cooperative commonwealth, public employment during hard times, and various economic reforms. They believed that the social conditions of the 1880s required drastic change and that ordinary Americans had lost control over their lives due to unrestrained economic growth and political corruption.\n\n7. **Challenging Social Darwinism and Liberty of Contract**: The Knights launched a sustained assault on prevailing notions of freedom that were grounded in Social Darwinism and the concept of liberty of contract. They argued that these ideologies contributed to the exploitation of workers and the erosion of their rights.\n\nOverall, the Knights of Labor played a crucial role in advocating for the rights and welfare of workers during a time of significant economic and social upheaval in the United States. Their efforts laid the groundwork for future labor movements and reforms.
