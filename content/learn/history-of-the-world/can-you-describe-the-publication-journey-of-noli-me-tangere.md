    Can you describe the publication journey of Noli Me Tangere?
answer: >-
    The publication journey of JosÃ© Rizal's novel *Noli Me Tangere* is a significant aspect of its history and impact. Rizal completed the writing of the novel in February 1887, but he faced considerable challenges in getting it published due to financial constraints. Initially, he sought funding to print the book, which was inspired by Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* and aimed to critique the social injustices and corruption prevalent in the Philippines under Spanish colonial rule.\n\nTo overcome these financial hurdles, Rizal received assistance from his friend Maximo Viola, who lent him $300. This funding allowed Rizal to print 2,000 copies of *Noli Me Tangere* in Berlin, Germany, in 1887. The printing process was completed at a cost of 300 pesos, and the novel was published in Spanish, which was the language of the educated elite at the time.\n\nUpon its release, *Noli Me Tangere* quickly gained attention and became a sensation, as it boldly addressed the inequities faced by Filipinos, particularly the abuses of the Spanish clergy and colonial government. However, the book also faced backlash; it was banned in the Philippines by outraged church officials who were offended by its critical portrayal of their practices.\n\nRizal's return to the Philippines later that year was marked by controversy, as the novel's themes of social injustice and national consciousness resonated with the growing sentiments of reform and resistance among Filipinos. The publication of *Noli Me Tangere* not only contributed to Rizal's legacy as a national hero but also played a crucial role in the development of Filipino identity and the eventual push for independence from colonial rule.
