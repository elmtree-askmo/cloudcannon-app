    How has India responded to the conflict in Gaza?
answer: >-
    India's response to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, particularly following the events of October 7, 2023, reflects a complex interplay of geopolitical considerations and domestic politics. The Indian government has sought to balance its historical ties with Palestine against its increasingly strategic relationship with Israel.\n\n1. **Alignment with U.S. Position**: Indiaâ€™s response has been closely aligned with the United States, emphasizing Israel's right to self-defense while also calling for restraint and the protection of civilian lives. This alignment indicates a shift in India's foreign policy, showcasing its growing assertiveness in international affairs.\n\n2. **Support for Palestinian Cause**: Despite its supportive stance towards Israel, India has reaffirmed its commitment to the Palestinian cause. The Indian government has advocated for a two-state solution, which includes a viable and sovereign state of Palestine coexisting peacefully alongside Israel. This position was highlighted during India's participation in various UN resolutions, where it voted in favor of measures addressing Palestinian rights and humanitarian needs.\n\n3. **Humanitarian Assistance**: India has also taken steps to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, sending 70 tonnes of assistance, including medical supplies, through Egypt. This action underscores India's recognition of the humanitarian crisis resulting from the conflict.\n\n4. **Diplomatic Engagements**: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has engaged in diplomatic discussions regarding the conflict, including hosting virtual summits that address the concerns of the developing world. His government has attempted to navigate the delicate balance of maintaining strong ties with both Israel and Arab nations.\n\n5. **Criticism and Abstentions**: Analysts have noted that India's responses to the Gaza crisis have been perceived as largely supportive of Israel, which has drawn criticism. For instance, India abstained from a UN resolution that addressed the conflict, reflecting its cautious approach to avoid alienating Arab states while still supporting Israel.\n\nIn summary, India's response to the Gaza conflict illustrates a nuanced diplomatic strategy that seeks to strengthen its ties with Israel while not completely sidelining its historical support for Palestine. This balancing act is indicative of India's evolving foreign policy under Prime Minister Modi, as it navigates the complexities of regional and global dynamics.
