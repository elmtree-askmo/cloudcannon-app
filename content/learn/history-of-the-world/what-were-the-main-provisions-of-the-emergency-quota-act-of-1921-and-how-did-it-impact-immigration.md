answer: >-
    The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 was a significant piece of legislation in U.S. immigration policy, marking the first time that numerical limits were placed on immigration based on national origins. Here are the main provisions and impacts of the Act:\n\n### Main Provisions:\n1. **Establishment of Quotas**: The Act set a quota for immigrants from each nationality, limiting the number of immigrants to 3% of the number of residents from that country already living in the United States as of the 1910 Census. This meant that countries with larger immigrant populations in the U.S. had higher quotas, while those with smaller populations faced stricter limits.\n\n2. **Overall Cap on Immigration**: The total number of immigrants allowed from outside the Western Hemisphere was capped at approximately 358,000 per year. This was the first annual numerical cap on U.S. immigration.\n\n3. **Temporary Nature**: Initially, the Emergency Quota Act was intended to be a temporary measure, set to last just over one year. However, it laid the groundwork for more permanent immigration restrictions that would follow, particularly the Immigration Act of 1924.\n\n### Impact on Immigration:\n- **Discrimination Based on Nationality**: The quota system favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, who had higher quotas, while significantly limiting those from Eastern and Southern Europe and non-European countries. This reflected and reinforced existing prejudices and nativist sentiments in American society.\n\n- **Shift in Immigration Patterns**: The Act contributed to a dramatic decline in immigration from certain regions, particularly Eastern and Southern Europe, as potential immigrants faced much stricter entry requirements. This shift had long-lasting effects on the demographic composition of immigrants to the U.S.\n\n- **Foundation for Future Legislation**: The Emergency Quota Act set a precedent for future immigration laws, including the more restrictive National Origins Act of 1924, which made the quotas stricter and permanent. It established a framework for immigration policy that would remain in place until the Immigration Act of 1965, which abolished ethnicity-based quotas.\n\n- **Political Context**: The Act was a reflection of the political climate of the 1920s, characterized by isolationism and a fear of foreign influence following World War I. It illustrated the growing nativist sentiment and the desire among certain segments of the American population to restrict immigration.\n\nIn summary, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 was a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration history, establishing a quota system that favored certain nationalities and laid the groundwork for future restrictive immigration policies. Its impact was felt for decades, shaping the demographic landscape of the United States and influencing immigration attitudes and legislation.
