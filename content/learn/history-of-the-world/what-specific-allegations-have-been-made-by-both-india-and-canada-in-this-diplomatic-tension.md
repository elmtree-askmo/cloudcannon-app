    What specific allegations have been made by both India and Canada in this diplomatic tension?
answer: >-
    The diplomatic tensions between India and Canada have escalated significantly, primarily revolving around allegations related to the assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Here are the specific allegations made by both countries:\n\n1. **Canada's Allegations**:\n   - The Canadian government has accused Indian government agents of being involved in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was a Canadian citizen and a prominent Sikh activist. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that Canadian intelligence agencies had credible evidence linking Indian agents to this assassination.\n   - Canada has also accused Indian diplomats of engaging in a "campaign of violence" against Sikh separatists on Canadian soil, which includes activities such as extortion, harassment, and intimidation of members of the Sikh diaspora. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has suggested that these agents were part of a broader criminal network that posed a significant threat to public safety in Canada.\n\n2. **India's Response**:\n   - India has firmly denied these allegations, labeling them as "preposterous." The Indian government has accused the Trudeau administration of providing a platform for violent extremists and terrorists to threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada.\n   - In retaliation to Canada's expulsion of six Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, India expelled six Canadian diplomats from New Delhi, marking a significant diplomatic standoff.\n\nThe situation reflects a deepening rift in what was historically a cordial relationship, with both nations taking strong stances against each other's accusations. The ongoing conflict highlights the complexities of international relations, particularly concerning issues of national security and diaspora politics.
