    Who were the Puritans and Separatists, and why did they flee Europe?
answer: >-
    The Puritans and Separatists were two distinct groups of English Calvinists who emerged in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, both seeking to address their dissatisfaction with the Church of England.\n\n**Puritans** were primarily focused on reforming the Church of England from within. They sought to "purify" the church of what they perceived as remnants of Catholicism and to implement a more rigorous and devout form of worship. Unlike the Separatists, Puritans did not advocate for complete separation from the Church of England; instead, they aimed for a reformation that would align the church more closely with their interpretations of the Bible.\n\n**Separatists**, on the other hand, were more radical in their beliefs. They felt that the Church of England was beyond reform due to its inherent corruption and thus sought to separate entirely from it. This group included the Pilgrims, who famously established the Plymouth Colony in 1620. The Separatists formed independent congregations and were often subject to persecution for their beliefs, which led them to seek refuge in the New World.\n\nBoth groups fled Europe primarily to escape religious persecution and to gain the freedom to worship according to their beliefs. The Separatists, in particular, faced significant repression in England, prompting them to leave for the New World to establish a society where they could practice their faith without fear of punishment. The Puritan migration, known as the "Great Migration," began in 1630 and saw thousands of Puritans emigrate to New England, driven by the desire for religious liberty and the opportunity to create a community based on their religious ideals.\n\nIn summary, while both the Puritans and Separatists sought religious freedom, their approaches differed significantly: Puritans aimed to reform the Church of England from within, while Separatists sought to completely break away from it. Their migrations to America were motivated by the need for a safe haven to practice their faith freely.
