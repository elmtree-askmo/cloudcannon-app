    What are some of the key phrases and ideals in the Declaration of Independence?
answer: >-
    The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, is a foundational document of the United States that articulates key phrases and ideals that have had a lasting impact on American society and governance. Some of the most significant phrases and concepts include:\n\n1. **Equality**: The Declaration famously states, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." This assertion establishes the principle that every individual has equal rights and is a cornerstone of American democracy.\n\n2. **Unalienable Rights**: The document emphasizes that individuals are endowed with certain unalienable rights, which include "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." These rights are considered inherent and cannot be taken away by the government.\n\n3. **Consent of the Governed**: The Declaration asserts that governments are instituted among men "deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." This principle underscores the idea that legitimate government authority comes from the will of the people.\n\n4. **Right to Alter or Abolish Government**: It states, "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it." This ideal empowers citizens to change or remove a government that fails to protect their rights.\n\n5. **Formal Declaration of Independence**: The document concludes with a formal declaration that the colonies are "Free and Independent States," absolving them from allegiance to the British Crown and asserting their right to govern themselves.\n\nThese phrases encapsulate the ideological foundations of the United States and have inspired various movements for equality and justice throughout American history. The Declaration of Independence remains a powerful symbol of the values of freedom and democracy.
