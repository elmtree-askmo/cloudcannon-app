    What role did Joseph Pulitzer play in the fundraising efforts for the Statue of Liberty?
answer: >-
    Joseph Pulitzer played a crucial role in the fundraising efforts for the Statue of Liberty, particularly for its pedestal. In 1884, when the American Committee for the Statue of Liberty ran out of funds to complete the pedestal, Pulitzer, a prominent newspaper publisher, stepped in to help. He launched a fundraising campaign through his newspaper, the New York World, urging the American public to contribute.\n\nPulitzer's campaign was remarkably successful; he managed to raise over $100,000 in just six months, which was a significant amount at the time. This fundraising effort is often regarded as one of the first instances of crowdfunding in America. He inspired approximately 120,000 working-class New Yorkers to donate, making them feel a sense of pride and ownership in the project. The contributions were tracked publicly in the newspaper, which helped to maintain momentum and encourage further donations.\n\nUltimately, Pulitzer's efforts ensured the completion of the pedestal, allowing the Statue of Liberty to be officially unveiled and dedicated on October 28, 1886. His campaign not only saved the statue but also highlighted the importance of civic engagement and philanthropy in American society.
