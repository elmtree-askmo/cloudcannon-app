answer: >-
    The Election Commission of India (ECI) is actively preparing for the upcoming Jharkhand Assembly elections, which are scheduled to take place in two phases on November 13 and November 20, 2024. The current term of the 81-seat Assembly is set to expire on January 5, 2025, prompting the need for timely elections.\n\nKey preparations by the Election Commission include:\n\n1. **Election Schedule Announcement**: The ECI announced the election schedule on October 15, 2024, detailing the voting dates and the counting of votes, which will occur on November 23, 2024.\n\n2. **Polling Stations Setup**: A total of 29,562 polling stations will be established across 20,276 locations to facilitate the voting process.\n\n3. **Voter Awareness Campaign**: Former Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been appointed as the brand ambassador for the elections. His role will focus on enhancing voter awareness and encouraging participation among the electorate.\n\n4. **Constituency-Specific Details**: The election will see varying numbers of voting rounds across different constituencies, with Chatra (SC) having the most rounds at 27, while Torpa (ST) in Khunti district will have the least at 13.\n\n5. **Voter Turnout Goals**: The Election Commission aims to achieve a high voter turnout, building on previous successes where turnout was recorded at 68.45%, with some constituencies like Nala in Dumka achieving as high as 80.3%.\n\nThese preparations reflect the ECI's commitment to conducting free and fair elections while ensuring that the electoral process is accessible and engaging for all voters in Jharkhand.
