    What historical context is relevant to understanding the Netflix series controversy?
answer: >-
    The controversy surrounding the Netflix series "Queen Cleopatra," which was released on April 12, 2023, is rooted in several historical and cultural contexts. The series, produced by Jada Pinkett Smith, has sparked significant debate primarily due to its portrayal of Cleopatra, one of the most famous figures in ancient history. \n\nHistorically, Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, is often depicted as having Greek heritage, being a descendant of Ptolemy I Soter, a companion of Alexander the Great. This background has led to discussions about her racial identity, with many arguing that she was likely of Macedonian Greek descent rather than African. The casting choices and the narrative direction of the docu-drama have been criticized for perceived historical inaccuracies and for not adequately representing the complexities of Cleopatra's identity.\n\nThe reaction to the series has been multifaceted, encompassing accusations of historical inaccuracy, concerns about representation, and discussions about racism. Critics have pointed out that the portrayal of Cleopatra in the series does not align with historical records, leading to claims that the series is an example of "historical revisionism." Additionally, the controversy has been fueled by broader societal discussions about representation in media, particularly regarding the portrayal of historical figures of color.\n\nIslam Issa, a professor of literature and history who appears in the series, has commented on the controversy, noting that he was the only Egyptian voice featured, which raises questions about the authenticity and diversity of perspectives presented in the docu-drama.\n\nThis controversy is not isolated; Netflix has faced similar backlash in the past for various other productions, such as "13 Reasons Why" and "Cuties," which have also sparked debates about their content and impact on audiences. The ongoing discussions about representation, historical accuracy, and the responsibilities of media producers in portraying diverse narratives are crucial to understanding the context of the Netflix series controversy surrounding "Queen Cleopatra."
