    Module 3 of the course on Philippine History focuses on various socio-economic and political concerns that have shaped the nation. The module is structured to analyze the following key issues:\n\n1. **Philippine Constitution**: This section examines the evolution of the Philippine Constitution, highlighting its significance in establishing the framework for governance and the rule of law in the country. It discusses the different constitutions that have been enacted, including the 1935 Constitution and the 1986 Constitution, and their implications for political stability and citizen rights.\n\n2. **Taxation**: The module addresses the taxation system in the Philippines, exploring its historical context and the role it plays in the socio-economic landscape. It discusses how taxation policies have evolved and their impact on economic development and social equity.\n\n3. **Agrarian Reform**: A critical aspect of the module is the analysis of agrarian reform policies from the Commonwealth period to the Fifth Republic. This includes discussions on the Philippine Bill of 1902, which set land ownership limits, and subsequent reforms aimed at addressing land distribution issues and improving the livelihoods of farmers.\n\n4. **Social, Political, Economic, and Cultural Issues**: The module emphasizes the interconnectedness of these issues, illustrating how historical events and decisions have led to contemporary challenges in Philippine society. It encourages students to recognize that many of today's problems are rooted in historical contexts and decisions.\n\nOverall, Module 3 aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how these socio-economic and political concerns have influenced the Philippines' journey towards independence and self-governance, fostering critical thinking about the implications of historical events on current issues.
