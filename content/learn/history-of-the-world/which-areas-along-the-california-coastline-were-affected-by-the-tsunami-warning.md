    Which areas along the California coastline were affected by the tsunami warning?
answer: >-
    The tsunami warning issued following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Humboldt County affected a significant stretch of the California coastline. Specifically, the warning extended from southern Oregon down to just north of Santa Cruz, impacting areas such as Fort Bragg and the San Francisco Bay. The warning was initially issued for nearly 600 miles of coastline, affecting approximately 5 million people. However, it was quickly lifted after assessments indicated that the risk of a damaging tsunami was receding. \n\nThe warning was a reminder of the potential hazards associated with seismic events in the region, particularly given that the earthquake was the strongest recorded in the area since the 1990s.
