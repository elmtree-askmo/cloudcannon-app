    What is the selection process for India's entry to the Oscars?
answer: >-
    The selection process for India's entry to the Oscars is managed by the Film Federation of India (FFI). Here are the key steps involved in this process:\n\n1. **Submission Invitation**: The FFI invites entries from Indian filmmakers. This is an open call for films that meet the eligibility criteria for the Academy Awards.\n\n2. **Jury Selection**: A 13-member jury, composed of experienced professionals from the film industry, is appointed by the FFI. This jury is responsible for reviewing the submitted films.\n\n3. **Film Eligibility**: To qualify as an entry for the Best International Feature Film category, a film must be a feature-length motion picture (over 40 minutes) produced outside the USA and its territories, with more than 50% of its dialogue in a language other than English.\n\n4. **Review and Voting**: The jury watches all the submitted films. After reviewing, they conduct a voting process to select one film that will represent India at the Oscars. This process typically involves two rounds of voting.\n\n5. **Announcement**: Once the jury has made its decision, the selected film is announced as India's official entry for the Academy Awards.\n\nFor instance, Kiran Rao's film "Laapataa Ladies" was chosen as India's official entry for the Best International Feature Film category at the 97th Academy Awards, which reflects the structured and transparent nature of the selection process implemented by the FFI. \n\nThis process has been in place since India began submitting films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film in 1957.
