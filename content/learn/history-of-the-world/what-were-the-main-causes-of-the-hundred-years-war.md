    What were the main causes of the Hundred Years’ War?
answer: >-
    The Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) was a complex conflict primarily driven by a combination of dynastic, political, and economic factors. Here are the main causes:\n\n1. **Dynastic Disputes**: The war was significantly influenced by claims to the French throne. After the death of Charles IV of France in 1328, Edward III of England claimed the French crown through his mother, Isabella, who was the daughter of Philip IV of France. This claim was contested by the French nobility, leading to tensions that escalated into war.\n\n2. **Territorial Disputes**: English kings held substantial territories in France, particularly the Duchy of Aquitaine. The French monarchy sought to assert control over these lands, leading to conflicts over territorial rights. The ongoing disputes regarding these possessions were a major catalyst for the war.\n\n3. **Economic Factors**: The wool trade was a significant economic driver for both England and France. Disputes over trade routes and economic interests, particularly in the context of the lucrative wool trade, contributed to the hostilities. The war disrupted trade, leading to economic strain in both countries.\n\n4. **Feudal Rivalries**: The feudal system created a complex web of allegiances and rivalries. The English monarchs were vassals to the French king for their lands in France, which created conflicting loyalties and tensions. This feudal dynamic exacerbated the conflict as both sides sought to assert their dominance.\n\n5. **Political Factors**: The broader geopolitical landscape of 14th-century Europe, including the ambitions of the Capetian dynasty in France and the desire of English kings to expand their influence, played a crucial role. The war was not just about territorial claims but also about the balance of power in Europe.\n\nIn summary, the Hundred Years' War was fueled by a mix of dynastic claims, territorial disputes, economic interests, feudal rivalries, and political ambitions, making it a multifaceted conflict that shaped the history of both England and France.
