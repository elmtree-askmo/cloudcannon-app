    How did Emma Lazarus's poem become associated with the Statue of Liberty?
answer: >-
    Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" became associated with the Statue of Liberty primarily through its creation and subsequent placement at the statue's pedestal. Written in 1883, Lazarus composed the sonnet to help raise funds for the construction of the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, which was a gift from France to the United States. The poem presents the statue as a welcoming figure, contrasting it with the ancient Colossus of Rhodes, and emphasizes themes of immigration and refuge.\n\nIn 1903, "The New Colossus" was cast onto a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal's lower level. This act solidified the poem's connection to the statue, as it became a part of the monument itself. Over time, the words of Lazarus's poem resonated with the American public, capturing the spirit of liberty and hope for immigrants arriving in the United States. The plaque was later moved to the main entrance hall of the statue, further enhancing its visibility and significance.\n\nLazarus's poem has since become an integral part of the identity of the Statue of Liberty, inspiring countless individuals and shaping the perception of America as a land of opportunity and refuge for those seeking a new life. The lines from "The New Colossus," particularly the famous invitation to the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free," have become emblematic of the American ideal of welcoming immigrants and exiles.
