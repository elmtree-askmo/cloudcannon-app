    What was the significance of the Gadsden Purchase (1853) for U.S. territorial expansion?
answer: >-
    The Gadsden Purchase, finalized in 1853, was significant for U.S. territorial expansion for several reasons:\n\n1. **Strategic Land Acquisition**: The Gadsden Purchase involved the acquisition of approximately 29,670 square miles of land from Mexico, which included parts of present-day southern Arizona and New Mexico. This land was crucial for the planned construction of a southern route for the Transcontinental Railroad, which was essential for connecting the eastern and western parts of the United States and facilitating trade and migration.\n\n2. **Completion of Territorial Expansion**: The purchase represented one of the last major territorial acquisitions in the contiguous United States. It helped to solidify U.S. claims to the southwestern territories following the Mexican-American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which had already expanded U.S. territory significantly.\n\n3. **Manifest Destiny**: The Gadsden Purchase was also a manifestation of the ideology of Manifest Destiny, the belief that the expansion of the U.S. across the American continents was both justified and inevitable. This purchase further exemplified the U.S. commitment to expanding its territory and influence.\n\n4. **Political Context**: The acquisition was negotiated by James Gadsden, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, and was motivated by the desire to resolve ongoing border disputes and to facilitate the construction of infrastructure that would promote economic growth. The $10 million price tag was seen as a reasonable investment for the strategic benefits it would provide.\n\n5. **Impact on Native Americans**: The Gadsden Purchase, like other territorial acquisitions, had significant implications for Native American populations in the region. The expansion of U.S. territory often led to the displacement of Native American tribes and further encroachment on their lands, exacerbating tensions and conflicts.\n\nIn summary, the Gadsden Purchase was a pivotal moment in U.S. history that not only expanded the nation's territory but also reinforced the principles of Manifest Destiny, facilitated economic development through infrastructure projects, and had lasting impacts on Native American communities.
