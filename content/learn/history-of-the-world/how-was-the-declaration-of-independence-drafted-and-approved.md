    How was the Declaration of Independence drafted and approved?
answer: >-
    The drafting and approval of the Declaration of Independence was a significant event in American history, marking the formal assertion of the Thirteen Colonies' intention to separate from British rule. This process began on June 11, 1776, when the Second Continental Congress appointed a "Committee of Five" to draft the declaration. The committee consisted of prominent figures: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman.\n\nThomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, was chosen as the principal author due to his reputation as an eloquent writer and his commitment to the principles of individual rights and self-determination. Jefferson's draft outlined the colonies' grievances against King George III and articulated the philosophical foundations of the new nation, famously stating that "all men are created equal" and are endowed with certain inalienable rights, including "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\nThe committee worked on the draft from June 11 until July 5, 1776. During this time, Jefferson's original text underwent revisions and edits by his fellow committee members and the delegates of the Continental Congress. The final version was presented to Congress, which debated and made further changes before formally adopting the document on July 4, 1776. This date is now celebrated as Independence Day in the United States.\n\nAfter the adoption, the Declaration was printed and distributed. By July 9, all thirteen colonies had signified their approval, allowing Congress to order that the Declaration be "fairly engrossed on parchment." Timothy Matlack is believed to have been responsible for this final version, which was signed by members of Congress.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence not only served as a formal statement of separation from Britain but also laid the ideological groundwork for the new nation, emphasizing the principles of democracy and individual rights that would shape the United States' future.
