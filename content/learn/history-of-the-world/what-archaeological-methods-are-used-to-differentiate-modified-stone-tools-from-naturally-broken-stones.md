    What archaeological methods are used to differentiate modified stone tools from naturally broken stones?
answer: >-
    To differentiate modified stone tools from naturally broken stones, archaeologists employ a variety of methods that focus on morphological characteristics, surface examination, and contextual analysis. Here are the key archaeological methods used in this differentiation:\n\n1. **Morphological Analysis**: This involves examining the shape and form of the stone. Man-made tools typically exhibit specific shapes that are not found in naturally occurring stones. For example, tools may have a defined striking platform, which is the surface where the stone was struck to create flakes, and recognizable edges that show signs of intentional shaping.\n\n2. **Surface Examination**: Researchers look for evidence of human activity on the stone's surface, which includes:\n   - **Percussion Scars**: Marks left on the stone from the striking process, often appearing as small, conical depressions or ridges along the edges of the tool.\n   - **Retouching Marks**: Finer modifications made to the edges of the tool to enhance functionality, identifiable by distinct patterns compared to natural wear.\n\n3. **Conchoidal Fracture Patterns**: Man-made tools often exhibit smooth, curved surfaces resulting from controlled striking, known as conchoidal fractures. In contrast, naturally occurring stones may have irregular breakage patterns without these smooth, curved surfaces.\n\n4. **Thermal Flaws**: Natural stones may show signs of thermal fractures, which appear as concentric rings. In contrast, man-made tools will have scars that radiate from the edges inward, indicating they were struck intentionally.\n\n5. **Scoring Method**: Archaeologists may use a scoring system to evaluate the characteristics of flakes. This method assigns scores based on various features, where lower scores suggest a natural origin (geofacts) and higher scores indicate human-made artifacts (artefacts).\n\n6. **Contextual Analysis**: The context in which the stone is found can provide additional clues. Stones located within an archaeological site alongside other artifacts are more likely to be man-made, while stones found in natural settings without associated artifacts are more likely to be naturally occurring.\n\nBy combining these methods, researchers can effectively distinguish between natural stones and human-manufactured tools, enhancing our understanding of early human technology and behavior.
