    What are the common challenges faced when implementing iClicker technology in classrooms?
answer: >-
    When implementing iClicker technology in classrooms, several common challenges can arise:\n\n1. **Technical Issues**: One of the most frequently reported challenges is technical problems, such as wireless connectivity issues. Instructors have encountered difficulties with the iClicker system not functioning properly, which can disrupt the flow of a lesson. For instance, last fall, many instructors faced wireless issues that hindered the use of iClicker effectively in their classrooms.\n\n2. **Setup and Troubleshooting Time**: The need for adequate time to set up and troubleshoot the technology can be a significant barrier. Instructors must ensure that the system is operational before class begins, which can be time-consuming and may require additional training or support.\n\n3. **Student Familiarity and Engagement**: While iClicker aims to enhance student engagement, there may be a learning curve for students who are not familiar with the technology. If students are not comfortable using the clickers or mobile app, it can lead to decreased participation and engagement.\n\n4. **Cost of Technology**: The requirement for students to purchase technology, such as iClicker remotes or mobile apps, can be a financial burden. This may lead to disparities in participation if some students cannot afford the necessary devices.\n\n5. **Integration with Curriculum**: Effectively integrating iClicker into the curriculum can be challenging. Instructors need to identify appropriate use cases and ensure that the technology complements their teaching methods rather than detracting from them.\n\n6. **Dependence on Technology**: There is a risk that instructors may become overly reliant on iClicker for classroom interaction, potentially neglecting other effective teaching strategies. It is important to balance the use of technology with traditional methods of engagement.\n\n7. **Limited Research and Support**: As iClicker technology is still relatively new, there may be limited research on its effectiveness and best practices for implementation. Instructors may need to seek out additional resources or support to navigate these challenges effectively.\n\nIn summary, while iClicker technology has the potential to enhance classroom engagement, instructors must be prepared to address these challenges to ensure successful implementation.
