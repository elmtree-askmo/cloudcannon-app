    What types of questions and inspections were conducted at Ellis Island?
answer: >-
    At Ellis Island, immigrants underwent a rigorous inspection process that included several key steps to determine their eligibility for entry into the United States. The inspections were primarily aimed at poorer immigrants arriving as third-class passengers, while first and second-class passengers were generally screened on board their ships.\n\n1. **Medical Examinations**: Upon arrival, immigrants first faced medical inspections, often referred to as "six-second physicals." These quick assessments were designed to identify any obvious health issues. If an immigrant showed signs of a contagious disease or other health problems, they could be denied entry.\n\n2. **Legal Inspections**: After the medical checks, immigrants proceeded to the legal inspection area. Here, they were interviewed by immigration inspectors who asked a series of questions to verify their identity and assess their admissibility. Immigrants typically answered 29 questions regarding their background, including their name, age, occupation, and destination in the United States.\n\n3. **Documentation Review**: Inspectors also reviewed the immigrants' paperwork, including the Manifest of Alien Passengers, which listed the ship's passengers. The inspectors cross-checked the immigrants' answers against the information recorded on the manifest to ensure consistency.\n\n4. **Interpreters**: To facilitate communication, interpreters fluent in various languages were available to assist immigrants during the inspection process. This was crucial, as many immigrants spoke little to no English.\n\n5. **Reasons for Denial**: Common reasons for denying entry included having a contagious disease, a criminal background, or being deemed likely to become a public charge (i.e., dependent on government assistance).\n\nOverall, the inspection process at Ellis Island was a critical step in the immigration journey, reflecting the complex demands of U.S. immigration laws and the bureaucratic procedures that could either grant or withhold permission to land in the country.
