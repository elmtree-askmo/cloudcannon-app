    The key proposals for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict included a 60-day cessation of hostilities aimed at establishing lasting peace. However, these proposals were rejected due to Hezbollah's insistence on fighting until a ceasefire in Gaza and Israeli concerns about Hezbollah's military actions, along with complex geopolitical factors.

    What were the key proposals for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, and why were they rejected?
answer: >-
    The key proposals for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict included a 60-day cessation of hostilities, which was part of a broader effort led by the United States and France. This proposal aimed to establish a framework for a lasting peace, aligning with the parameters of UN Resolution 1701, which had previously ended the Lebanon-Israel war in 2006. The ceasefire deal was characterized by President Biden as an attempt to achieve a "permanent cessation of hostilities."\n\nHowever, several factors contributed to the rejection of the ceasefire proposals by both sides. Firstly, Hezbollah expressed its intention to continue fighting until there was a ceasefire in Gaza, indicating that their broader strategic goals were not aligned with the proposed terms. Additionally, Israeli officials were concerned about the potential for Hezbollah to launch attacks similar to those carried out by Hamas, which had escalated tensions in the region. As a result, Israel insisted on retaining the right to respond militarily if Hezbollah violated the ceasefire agreement, which became a significant sticking point in negotiations.\n\nMoreover, the complex geopolitical dynamics, including Hezbollah's backing by Iran and its designation as a terrorist organization by several countries, further complicated the ceasefire discussions. Both parties had their own reasons for rejecting the truce, reflecting the deep-seated hostilities and mistrust that characterize the Israel-Hezbollah relationship.
