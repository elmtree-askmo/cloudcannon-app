    What were the early domesticated plants and animals during the Neolithic period?
answer: >-
    During the Neolithic period, which marked the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities, several key plants and animals were domesticated. This process, known as the Neolithic Revolution, began approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago in various regions around the world.\n\n### Early Domesticated Plants\n1. **Cereals**: The earliest domesticated crops included cereals such as:\n   - **Wheat** (Triticum spp.) and **Barley** (Hordeum vulgare) in the Fertile Crescent.\n   - **Millet** (Setaria italica and Panicum miliaceum) and **Rice** (Oryza sativa) in East Asia, domesticated around 8500â€“8000 years ago.\n\n2. **Legumes**: Plants like **lentils** and **chickpeas** were also among the first domesticated crops, providing essential protein sources.\n\n3. **Other Crops**: Other significant crops included **peas**, **flax**, and various fruits and vegetables that were cultivated as agriculture spread.\n\n### Early Domesticated Animals\n1. **Sheep** (Ovis aries) and **Goats** (Capra aegagrus hircus): These were among the first animals to be domesticated for their meat, milk, and wool.\n\n2. **Pigs** (Sus scrofa domesticus): Domesticated independently in various regions, pigs provided a reliable source of meat.\n\n3. **Cattle** (Bos taurus): Domestication of cattle occurred later, providing milk, meat, and labor for plowing.\n\n4. **Dogs** (Canis lupus familiaris): While domesticated earlier than the Neolithic period, dogs played a crucial role in hunting and companionship.\n\n5. **Draft Animals**: Larger animals such as **oxen** and **donkeys** were domesticated around 4,000 B.C. for agricultural work and transportation.\n\nThe domestication of these plants and animals was influenced by local environmental conditions and cultural practices, leading to a diverse array of agricultural systems across different regions. This shift to agriculture not only transformed human diets but also laid the foundation for the development of permanent settlements and complex societies.
