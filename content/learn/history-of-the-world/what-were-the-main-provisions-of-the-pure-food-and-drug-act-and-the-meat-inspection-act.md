    What were the main provisions of the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act?
answer: >-
    The Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act, both enacted in 1906, were significant pieces of legislation aimed at improving food safety and consumer protection in the United States.\n\n### Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)\nThe key provisions of the Pure Food and Drug Act included:\n\n1. **Banning Adulteration and Misbranding**: The Act prohibited the manufacture, sale, or transportation of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. This meant that products could not contain harmful substances or misleading labels.\n   \n2. **Labeling Requirements**: It established that food and drug labels must be truthful and not misleading. This provision aimed to eliminate false claims and quack cures that were prevalent at the time.\n\n3. **Consumer Protection**: The Act sought to protect consumers from harmful products and promote honesty in the marketplace, thereby improving public health.\n\n4. **Foundation for Future Regulations**: It laid the groundwork for future consumer protection laws and the establishment of regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n### Meat Inspection Act (1906)\nThe Meat Inspection Act focused on ensuring the safety and quality of meat products. Its key provisions included:\n\n1. **Federal Inspection System**: The Act mandated a federal inspection system for all meat products, requiring inspections of livestock before and after slaughter to ensure they were healthy and safe for consumption.\n\n2. **Sanitation Standards**: It established sanitation requirements for meat processing facilities to ensure that meat was processed under hygienic conditions.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Adulteration**: The Act prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded meat products, ensuring that consumers received safe and accurately labeled meat.\n\n4. **Labeling and Packaging**: It required that meat products be labeled and packaged according to specific standards to regulate commerce effectively and protect public health.\n\nBoth acts were responses to public outcry over unsanitary conditions in the food industry, notably highlighted by Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle," which exposed the harsh realities of the meatpacking industry. Together, these laws marked a significant step towards consumer protection and food safety in the United States.
