    What were the pivotal moments in Mother Teresa's early life that led to her religious calling?
answer: >-
    Mother Teresa, born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia, experienced several pivotal moments in her early life that shaped her religious calling and commitment to humanitarian work.\n\n1. **Early Fascination with Missionaries**: From a young age, Agnes was inspired by stories of missionaries and their service in Bengal. By the age of 12, she felt a strong conviction to commit herself to religious life, which laid the foundation for her future endeavors.\n\n2. **Religious Commitment**: In 1928, at the age of 18, she left her home to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she learned English with the intention of becoming a missionary. This decision marked a significant step towards her religious calling.\n\n3. **Arrival in India**: After becoming a novitiate, Agnes sailed to India in 1929, where she began teaching at St. Mary's High School in Calcutta. Her experiences in the city exposed her to the extreme poverty and suffering that many faced, which deeply impacted her.\n\n4. **Call Within a Call**: A transformative moment occurred on September 10, 1946, during a train journey from Calcutta to Darjeeling. Mother Teresa described this experience as a "call within a call," where she felt compelled to leave her teaching position and dedicate her life to serving the poorest of the poor. This pivotal moment led to the founding of the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, an organization dedicated to caring for the destitute and marginalized.\n\n5. **Spiritual Influences**: Her spiritual journey was further influenced by her devotion to prayer and her experiences at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages. This deepened her resolve to serve those in need.\n\nThese moments collectively shaped Mother Teresa's path, leading her to become a prominent figure in humanitarian efforts and a symbol of compassion and service to the poorest communities around the world.
