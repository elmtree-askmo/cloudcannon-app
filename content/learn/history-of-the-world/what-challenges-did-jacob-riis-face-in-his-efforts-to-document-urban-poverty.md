    What challenges did Jacob Riis face in his efforts to document urban poverty?
answer: >-
    Jacob Riis faced several significant challenges in his efforts to document urban poverty in late 19th-century New York City. \n\n1. **Living Conditions**: Riis himself experienced severe poverty after immigrating to the United States, which gave him firsthand insight into the struggles of the urban poor. However, the very conditions he sought to expose were often dangerous and unsanitary, making it difficult to navigate the tenements and slums safely. The overcrowded and dilapidated housing posed health risks, both to Riis and to the individuals he aimed to document.\n\n2. **Public Perception and Acceptance**: Riis's work was groundbreaking, but it also faced skepticism from the public and the elite. Many people were resistant to acknowledging the extent of poverty and the living conditions of immigrants. Riis had to find ways to persuade his audience of the urgency of the issues he was highlighting, which required not only compelling writing but also innovative methods of visual documentation.\n\n3. **Technological Limitations**: Although Riis was one of the first to use flash photography to capture images in poorly lit environments, the technology of the time was still limited. This posed challenges in capturing clear and impactful images that could effectively convey the dire conditions of the slums. The use of flash powder was a novel technique, but it also came with risks and required skill to execute properly.\n\n4. **Criticism and Revisionism**: In recent years, some scholars have critiqued Riis's work, labeling him as an "unreconstructed racist" who may have perpetuated stereotypes about the immigrant populations he aimed to help. This revisionist perspective presents a challenge in how his legacy is viewed today, complicating the narrative of his contributions to social reform.\n\n5. **Emotional Toll**: Documenting such harrowing conditions took an emotional toll on Riis. The suffering he witnessed and the stories he encountered could be overwhelming, and he had to balance his role as a journalist with his desire to advocate for change.\n\nDespite these challenges, Riis's work, particularly in his book "How the Other Half Lives," played a crucial role in raising awareness about urban poverty and influencing public health and sanitation reforms, including the efforts led by figures like Colonel George Waring. His pioneering use of photography and storytelling helped to illuminate the plight of the urban poor and catalyzed social reform movements in the United States.
