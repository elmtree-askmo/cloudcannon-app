    What were the features of the pre-independence occupational structure in India?
answer: >-
    The pre-independence occupational structure in India was characterized by several key features that reflected the socio-economic conditions under British colonial rule. Here are the salient features:\n\n1. **Predominance of Agriculture**: Approximately 70-75% of the Indian workforce was engaged in agriculture, making it the primary source of livelihood. This heavy reliance on agriculture was indicative of India's agrarian economy during the colonial period.\n\n2. **Limited Industrial Opportunities**: The industrial sector accounted for only about 10% of the workforce, which highlights the lack of opportunities in manufacturing. The British colonial policies focused on extracting raw materials from India rather than developing its industrial capabilities.\n\n3. **Service Sector Contribution**: The service sector comprised around 15-20% of the workforce. This sector included various occupations, but it was significantly smaller compared to agriculture and manufacturing.\n\n4. **Rural Dominance**: A majority of the population lived in rural areas, which were primarily agrarian. This rural-centric occupational structure contributed to widespread poverty and limited access to education and healthcare.\n\n5. **Stagnation and Lack of Change**: The occupational structure showed little sign of change over the colonial period. While some regions experienced a slight decline in agricultural dependence, the overall structure remained largely unchanged, with agriculture continuing to dominate.\n\n6. **Economic Exploitation**: The colonial policies led to a transformation of India from a self-sufficient economy with a mix of agriculture and manufacturing to a colony that primarily served British economic interests. This resulted in a significant decline in traditional industries and handicrafts.\n\n7. **Decentralization of Industries**: The British administration decentralized Indian industries, which further entrenched the countryâ€™s role as a supplier of raw materials and a market for British manufactured goods.\n\nThese features collectively illustrate the challenges faced by the Indian economy under colonial rule, including economic stagnation, poverty, and a lack of industrial development, which had long-lasting impacts on the country's economic landscape.
