    What were the key programs and policies of the First and Second New Deal?
answer: >-
    The New Deal, implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression, consisted of two distinct phases: the First New Deal (1933-1934) and the Second New Deal (1935-1936). Each phase had its own key programs and policies aimed at addressing the economic crisis and providing relief to the American populace.\n\n### Key Programs and Policies of the First New Deal\n\n1. **Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)** (1933-1935)\n   - Aimed to reduce agricultural surpluses and increase prices by curtailing production.\n\n2. **Civil Works Administration (CWA)** (1933-1934)\n   - Provided temporary jobs for the unemployed, focusing on public works projects.\n\n3. **Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)** (1933)\n   - Created to provide navigation, flood control, electricity generation, and economic development in the Tennessee Valley.\n\n4. **National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA)** (1933)\n   - Established codes of fair competition to stimulate industrial growth and protect workers' rights.\n\n5. **Glass-Steagall Act** (1933)\n   - Introduced banking reforms to separate commercial and investment banking, aimed at restoring public confidence in the banking system.\n\n6. **Home Owners' Loan Act** (1933)\n   - Provided refinancing of home mortgages to prevent foreclosure.\n\n7. **Public Works Administration (PWA)** (1933)\n   - Funded large-scale public works projects to create jobs and stimulate the economy.\n\n### Key Programs and Policies of the Second New Deal\n\n1. **Works Progress Administration (WPA)** (1935)\n   - Became the largest relief program, providing jobs for millions through public works projects, including infrastructure and arts programs.\n\n2. **Social Security Act** (1935)\n   - Established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled, providing financial assistance and unemployment insurance.\n\n3. **National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act)** (1935)\n   - Strengthened labor unions by protecting workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively.\n\n4. **Fair Labor Standards Act** (1938)\n   - Established minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor laws, aiming to improve working conditions.\n\n5. **Rural Electrification Administration (REA)** (1935)\n   - Aimed to bring electricity to rural areas, improving living standards and economic opportunities.\n\n6. **Farm Security Administration (FSA)** (1937)\n   - Provided loans to farmers and helped them improve their living conditions.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\nThe First New Deal primarily focused on immediate relief and stabilization of the economy, while the Second New Deal aimed for long-term recovery and structural reforms. The Second New Deal introduced more comprehensive social welfare programs and aimed to redistribute wealth and power in favor of the disadvantaged, including labor unions and the elderly.\n\nOverall, both phases of the New Deal were crucial in addressing the economic challenges of the Great Depression, with the First New Deal laying the groundwork for the more extensive reforms of the Second New Deal.
