    Can you provide examples of the individual's activism that led to arrests?
answer: >-
    Rosa Parks is one of the most notable examples of an individual whose activism led to her arrest. On December 1, 1955, she was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a city bus. This act of civil disobedience was pivotal, as it sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a significant event in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Parks' arrest highlighted the injustices of racial segregation and galvanized the African American community to take action against discriminatory laws.\n\nAnother prominent figure in civil rights activism is Congressman John Lewis, who was arrested approximately 40 times between 1960 and 1966. His arrests were primarily due to his participation in protests against racist laws and practices in the Jim Crow South. For instance, during the Freedom Rides, Lewis and other activists faced violent opposition and were arrested for attempting to integrate public transportation, which was still segregated despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Boynton v. Virginia.\n\nAdditionally, the Freedom Riders themselves were frequently arrested for their nonviolent protests against segregation. In one instance, a group of Freedom Riders was arrested in Houston, Texas, for unlawful assembly after they refused to leave a segregated waiting area in a Greyhound terminal.\n\nThese examples illustrate the courage and commitment of civil rights activists who faced arrest as a consequence of their efforts to challenge and dismantle systemic racism and segregation in the United States.
