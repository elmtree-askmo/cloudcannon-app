    How did Sojourner Truth advocate for abolition and women's rights?
answer: >-
    Sojourner Truth was a pivotal figure in the antebellum period, advocating for both abolition and women's rights through her powerful speeches and activism. Born Isabella Baumfree around 1797 in New York, she was enslaved until her emancipation in 1827. After gaining her freedom, she felt called by God to travel and speak out against the injustices faced by African Americans and women.\n\nOne of her most significant contributions to the women's rights movement was her iconic speech, "Ain't I a Woman?", delivered at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in 1851. In this speech, she eloquently addressed the intersection of race and gender, challenging prevailing notions of femininity and advocating for the rights of Black women. She argued that the struggles for abolition and women's rights were interconnected, asserting that the liberation of enslaved people and the emancipation of women were inseparable causes.\n\nBeyond her speeches, Truth's activism included broader social reforms, such as prison reform and property rights for women. She was known for her acts of defiance and civil disobedience, which further highlighted her commitment to justice and equality. Her work during the Civil War also earned her recognition, including an invitation to meet President Abraham Lincoln in 1864.\n\nSojourner Truth's legacy as an abolitionist and women's rights advocate is marked by her ability to weave together the struggles for racial and gender equality, making her a significant figure in American history. Her life and activism continue to inspire movements for social justice today.
