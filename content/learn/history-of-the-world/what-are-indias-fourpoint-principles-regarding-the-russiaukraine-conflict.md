    India's four-point principles regarding the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as articulated by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, are as follows:\n\n1. **This is not the era of war**: India emphasizes that the current global context should not be characterized by warfare, advocating for peaceful resolutions instead.\n\n2. **There are no solutions on the battlefield**: This principle underscores the belief that military confrontations will not yield lasting solutions to the conflict, suggesting that dialogue is essential.\n\n3. **Russia must be at the table**: India insists on the importance of including Russia in discussions aimed at resolving the conflict, recognizing its role in the geopolitical landscape.\n\n4. **Respect for the UN Charter and international law**: India highlights the necessity of adhering to the principles of the UN Charter, which includes respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.\n\nThese principles reflect India's neutral stance in the conflict, advocating for dialogue and negotiations to restore peace and address humanitarian concerns. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also called for an end to the war through diplomatic means, emphasizing the need for humanitarian aid and reducing the hardships caused by the conflict.
