This cultural representation helps to preserve and promote the identity of the Gullah people.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Exhibits related to the Gullah Geechee Corridor often emphasize the historical significance of the community, particularly in the context of the African American experience in the United States. This includes discussions on the legacy of slavery, the resilience of the Gullah people, and their contributions to American culture.
