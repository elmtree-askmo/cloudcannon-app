    What was the specific incident in South Lebanon that required UNIFIL's intervention?
answer: >-
    The specific incident in South Lebanon that required UNIFIL's intervention involved multiple attacks on its peacekeeping positions. Notably, on November 19, 2024, UNIFIL reported that its peacekeepers and facilities were targeted in three separate incidents, resulting in injuries to four peacekeepers. This followed a series of escalating tensions, including an incident where an Israeli tank fired at an observation tower at UNIFIL's headquarters in Naqoura, injuring two peacekeepers. \n\nIn addition to these incidents, UNIFIL has recorded over 30 incidents in October alone that resulted in property damage or injury to its soldiers, highlighting the ongoing security challenges in the region. The situation has been exacerbated by clashes and rocket fire from Lebanon, alongside heavy air and artillery strikes from Israel, necessitating UNIFIL's continued presence and intervention to monitor the situation and ensure the safety of its personnel.
