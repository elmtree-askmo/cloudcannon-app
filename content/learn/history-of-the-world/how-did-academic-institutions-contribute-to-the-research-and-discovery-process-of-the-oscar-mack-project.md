    How did academic institutions contribute to the research and discovery process of the Oscar Mack Project?
answer: >-
    Academic institutions played a significant role in the research and discovery process of the Oscar Mack Project (OMP) through community-based initiatives and collaborative efforts. The project, which investigates the reported lynching of Oscar Mack, an African American World War I veteran, was initiated in 2013 as part of an African-American History course at Rollins College. Under the guidance of Julian Chambliss, students engaged in critical-making digital history projects that aimed to uncover the details surrounding Mack's tragic death in Kissimmee, Florida, on July 16, 1922.\n\nThe involvement of students in this project not only provided them with hands-on research experience but also fostered a deeper understanding of the historical context of racial violence in Central Florida. The project emphasized the importance of community engagement and the role of academic institutions in addressing historical injustices. By examining archival materials and newspaper accounts, students contributed to a more comprehensive narrative of Mack's life and the racial tensions of the time.\n\nAdditionally, the Oscar Mack Project has been supported by various academic programs and events, such as the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, which has highlighted Mack's story in documentaries and public discussions. These academic collaborations have helped to raise awareness about the impact of racial violence on families and communities, promoting reconciliation and education.\n\nOverall, academic institutions have been instrumental in the Oscar Mack Project by facilitating research, encouraging community involvement, and fostering discussions about racial violence and its historical implications.
