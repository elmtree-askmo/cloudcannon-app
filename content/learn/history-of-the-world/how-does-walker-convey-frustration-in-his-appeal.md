    How does Walker convey frustration in his Appeal?
answer: >-
    David Walker conveys frustration in his "Appeal" through a combination of passionate rhetoric, historical references, and a direct challenge to both the moral and ethical foundations of American society. His writing reflects a deep sense of urgency and anger regarding the plight of enslaved and free Black individuals in the United States.\n\n1. **Rhetorical Techniques**: Walker employs powerful language and emotional appeals to express his frustration. He uses religious and political rhetoric to highlight the hypocrisy of a nation that prides itself on freedom while simultaneously oppressing a significant portion of its population. For instance, he contrasts the treatment of enslaved people in the United States with that of "heathen nations of antiquity," suggesting that even those societies were more humane than contemporary America.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Walker's frustration is rooted in the historical context of his time. He published his "Appeal" in 1829, a period when many Northern states had abolished slavery, yet the institution persisted in the South. Walker's awareness of this disparity fuels his anger, as he calls for immediate action against the injustices faced by Black Americans.\n\n3. **Call to Action**: Throughout the "Appeal," Walker's frustration manifests in his call for resistance and revolt. He urges enslaved individuals to rise against their oppressors, emphasizing that passive acceptance of their condition is unacceptable. This militant stance was radical for its time and reflects his deep-seated frustration with the status quo.\n\n4. **Global Perspective**: Walker addresses a global audience, which further illustrates his frustration with the limited scope of American abolitionist efforts. He seeks to unite free and enslaved Black people not just in America but across the world, indicating his belief that the struggle against oppression is a universal one.\n\nIn summary, Walker's "Appeal" is a powerful expression of frustration that combines emotional rhetoric, historical critique, and a call for militant action, all aimed at awakening the consciousness of Black Americans and challenging the moral failings of American society.
