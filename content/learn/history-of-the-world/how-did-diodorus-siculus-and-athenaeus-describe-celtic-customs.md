    Diodorus Siculus and Athenaeus provide valuable insights into Celtic customs through their historical writings.\n\n**Diodorus Siculus** (1st century BC) is particularly notable for his work, *Library of History*, where he offers a comprehensive account of various cultures, including the Celts. His observations cover a range of aspects of Celtic life, such as:\n\n- **Social Structure**: Diodorus describes the organization of Celtic society, highlighting their tribal divisions and the roles of leaders and warriors.\n- **Warfare**: He notes the Celts' martial prowess, detailing their unique approaches to combat, including their use of chariots and distinctive weaponry.\n- **Material Culture**: Diodorus provides descriptions of Celtic clothing, adornments, and artifacts, which reflect their artistic expressions and social norms.\n- **Trade Practices**: He discusses the economic interactions of the Celts with neighboring cultures, emphasizing their trade networks and the goods they exchanged.\n\n**Athenaeus**, a later Greek writer, also contributes to the understanding of Celtic customs, particularly through his work *Deipnosophistae*. While his focus is more on culinary practices and social gatherings, he includes references to:\n\n- **Celtic Feasting**: Athenaeus describes the importance of feasting in Celtic culture, noting the elaborate meals and the role of hospitality in their social interactions.\n- **Cultural Exchange**: He highlights the influence of Celtic customs on other cultures, particularly in terms of food and drink, showcasing the interconnectedness of ancient societies.\n\nBoth Diodorus and Athenaeus provide a multifaceted view of Celtic customs, emphasizing their complex social structures, rich material culture, and the significance of communal practices such as feasting and warfare. Their accounts are crucial for understanding the daily life and cultural identity of the Celts in the ancient world.
