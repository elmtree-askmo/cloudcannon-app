    What were the objectives and findings of the Dillingham Commission, and how did it influence immigration policy?
answer: >-
    The Dillingham Commission, officially known as the U.S. Immigration Commission, was established by Congress in 1907 and operated until 1910. Its primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive study of immigration to the United States, particularly focusing on the effects of immigration growth on American society. The commission was bipartisan and was formed under the leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n### Objectives of the Dillingham Commission\n\n1. **Assessment of Immigration**: The commission aimed to evaluate the origins, characteristics, and impacts of various immigrant groups, particularly those from southern and eastern Europe.\n2. **Scientific Foundation for Policy**: It sought to provide a scientific basis for immigration policy by categorizing immigrants into "desirable" and "undesirable" groups based on their perceived contributions to American society.\n3. **Comprehensive Reporting**: The commission was tasked with preparing a detailed report of its findings, which culminated in a voluminous 41-volume study.\n\n### Findings of the Dillingham Commission\n\n1. **Immigrant Characteristics**: The commission concluded that immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were less assimilable and posed a greater threat to American social structures compared to those from northern and western Europe.\n2. **Social and Economic Impact**: It reported that the influx of these immigrants contributed to social unrest and economic challenges, reinforcing existing prejudices and fears about immigration.\n3. **Bias in Recommendations**: Despite the commission's intent to provide an objective analysis, its findings were heavily influenced by the biases of its members, leading to recommendations that favored restrictive immigration policies.\n\n### Influence on Immigration Policy\n\nThe Dillingham Commission's findings had a profound impact on U.S. immigration policy in the years that followed:\n\n1. **Legislative Changes**: The commission's work laid the groundwork for the Immigration Act of 1924, which established national origins quotas that severely limited immigration from southern and eastern Europe while favoring northern and western European immigrants.\n2. **Enduring Legacy**: The commission's legacy continues to influence contemporary discussions on immigration policy, as it framed the narrative around "desirable" versus "undesirable" immigrants, a theme that persists in modern debates.\n\nIn summary, the Dillingham Commission played a crucial role in shaping early 20th-century immigration policy in the United States, driven by a combination of extensive research and prevailing social biases. Its findings and recommendations contributed to a more restrictive immigration framework that reflected the fears and prejudices of the time.
