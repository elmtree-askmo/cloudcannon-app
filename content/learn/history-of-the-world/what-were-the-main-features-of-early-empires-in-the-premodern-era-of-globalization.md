answer: >-
    The main features of early empires in the pre-modern era of globalization can be characterized by several key aspects:\n\n1. **Political Structure**: Early empires were often defined by a centralized political authority that controlled vast territories and diverse populations. This included various forms of governance, such as monarchies, theocracies, and bureaucratic states. For instance, the Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, is one of the earliest known empires that unified various city-states under a centralized rule.\n\n2. **Cultural Exchange**: Empires facilitated significant cultural interactions and exchanges among different peoples. The spread of languages, religions, and customs was common, as seen in the influence of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires, which profoundly affected the culture and ways of life of the peoples within their domains.\n\n3. **Economic Integration**: Early empires often engaged in extensive trade networks that connected different regions. This economic integration was crucial for the exchange of goods, resources, and technologies. The empires of the Mali and Songhai in West Africa, for example, thrived on trade in gold, salt, and other commodities, which linked them to broader economic systems.\n\n4. **Military Expansion**: Many early empires expanded their territories through military conquest. This expansion was often justified by the desire to spread culture, religion, or political ideology. The Roman Empire is a classic example, as it expanded across Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East, establishing a vast network of roads and trade routes.\n\n5. **Religious Influence**: Religion played a significant role in the governance and cultural identity of early empires. The Catholic Church, for instance, was a formidable power in Europe during the pre-modern era, influencing political decisions and societal norms. Similarly, Islamic empires like the Umayyad and Abbasid expanded not only their territories but also the reach of Islam.\n\n6. **Technological Advancements**: Early empires often benefited from technological innovations that facilitated administration, trade, and military conquests. For example, advancements in navigation and shipbuilding during the Age of Exploration allowed Iberian empires to establish overseas colonies and trade routes.\n\n7. **Social Hierarchies**: Empires typically had complex social structures, often characterized by a hierarchy that included elites, merchants, and commoners. This stratification influenced access to resources, power, and opportunities within the empire.\n\n8. **Interconnectedness**: The early empires were part of a larger web of interactions that laid the groundwork for proto-globalization. They established connections across continents, which would later evolve into more extensive global networks.\n\nIn summary, early empires in the pre-modern era of globalization were marked by centralized political authority, cultural exchange, economic integration, military expansion, religious influence, technological advancements, social hierarchies, and interconnectedness. These features contributed to the complex dynamics of early globalization and set the stage for later developments in the modern era.
