    What initiatives have been taken to preserve the history and culture of African-American communities in Scotland?
answer: >-
    Several initiatives have been undertaken to preserve the history and culture of African-American communities in Scotland, reflecting a growing recognition of their contributions and significance. Here are some notable efforts:\n\n1. **Commemorative Plaque Scheme**: Historic Environment Scotland announced that Frederick Douglass, an African American author and freedom fighter, is the first significant historic figure to be celebrated as part of its 2018 Commemorative Plaque Scheme. This initiative coincided with Black History Month and the 200th anniversary of Douglass's birth, highlighting his connection to Scotland and his role in anti-slavery campaigns during his visit in the mid-1840s.\n\n2. **Black Oot Here**: Co-authored by Francesca Sobande and layla-roxanne hill, the book "Black Oot Here: Black Lives in Scotland" sheds light on Black Scottish history, including the legacy of Black media, arts, activism, and creativity. This work aims to document and celebrate the experiences and histories of Black people in Scotland, contributing to a broader understanding of their cultural heritage.\n\n3. **Mural of Frederick Douglass**: A striking mural of Frederick Douglass has been added to the urban landscape in Edinburgh, serving as a visual reminder of his legacy and the historical ties between Scotland and the African American community.\n\n4. **African Builders Scotland**: This organization emphasizes the importance of collective efforts for cultural preservation. It actively seeks partnerships with cultural institutions, community organizations, and governmental bodies to enhance the impact of its initiatives.\n\n5. **Preserving Black Churches Program**: The Scotland A.M.E. Zion Church received $200,000 from the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. This funding supports the 2nd Century Project, a three-phase plan aimed at rescuing and preserving this historic building, which has been a cornerstone of the community founded by formerly enslaved African Americans.\n\nThese initiatives reflect a commitment to recognizing and preserving the cultural and historical significance of African-American communities in Scotland, ensuring that their contributions are acknowledged and celebrated.
