    How do the expressed powers of the Presidency differ from those of Congress?
answer: >-
    The expressed powers of the Presidency and Congress are defined by the United States Constitution, but they differ significantly in scope and nature.\n\n1. **Congressional Expressed Powers**: The expressed powers of Congress are detailed in Article I of the Constitution. These powers include the authority to make laws, regulate commerce, declare war, raise and support armies, and manage foreign affairs. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers," which allows for a broad interpretation of its legislative authority. This reflects the Framers' intention for Congress to be the most powerful branch of government, as they believed it would best represent the will of the people.\n\n2. **Presidential Expressed Powers**: In contrast, the expressed powers of the President are outlined in Article II of the Constitution. These powers include the authority to sign or veto legislation, command the armed forces, conduct foreign policy, and appoint federal officers and judges. The President also has the power to grant pardons and reprieves. While the President has significant authority, particularly in foreign affairs, this power is often seen as more limited compared to the legislative powers of Congress.\n\n3. **Nature of Powers**: The expressed powers of Congress are primarily legislative, allowing it to create laws and govern various aspects of national policy. The President's expressed powers, however, are more executive in nature, focusing on the implementation and enforcement of laws, as well as conducting foreign relations. \n\n4. **Checks and Balances**: The relationship between the expressed powers of the President and Congress is characterized by a system of checks and balances. For instance, while the President can veto legislation, Congress can override that veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. Additionally, Congress has the power to impeach the President, further ensuring that no single branch becomes too powerful.\n\nIn summary, while both branches have expressed powers defined by the Constitution, Congress holds broader legislative authority, whereas the President's powers are more focused on execution and enforcement of laws. This division reflects the Framers' intent to create a balanced government where power is shared and checked among the branches.
