answer: >-
    Thomas Mercer and Harvey Pike were significant figures in the early proposals for canal construction in the Seattle area during the mid-19th century.\n\n**Thomas Mercer** is often referred to as the "father of the idea of the canal." He was a visionary who, influenced by the Native American methods of transportation and possibly inspired by a dream of a waterway, proposed the concept of a canal that would connect Lake Washington to Puget Sound. Mercer arrived in the Seattle area in 1852 and was a prominent leader in the community, known for his role as a wagon master during his journey west. His ideas about the canal were rooted in the practical needs of transportation and trade, reflecting the aspirations of the growing settlement.\n\n**Harvey Pike**, on the other hand, is considered to be the "son" of Mercer's vision. He was the son of John Pike, who traveled west with Mercer. Harvey Pike took the initiative to begin the physical work of canal construction by attempting to dig a canal between Lake Washington and Puget Sound. Although he faced challenges due to the difficult glacial till in the area, his efforts marked the beginning of practical attempts to realize Mercer's vision. Pike's work, while not ultimately successful in creating the canal, contributed to the local folklore and highlighted the early entrepreneurial spirit in the region.\n\nTogether, Mercer and Pike represent the early ambitions and challenges faced in the development of infrastructure that would later evolve into the Lake Washington Ship Canal, a crucial element in Seattle's growth and development. Their contributions laid the groundwork for future engineering efforts that would eventually lead to the successful construction of the canal and its locks.
