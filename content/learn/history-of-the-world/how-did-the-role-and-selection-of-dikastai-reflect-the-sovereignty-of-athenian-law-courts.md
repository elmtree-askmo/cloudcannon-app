    How did the role and selection of dikastai reflect the sovereignty of Athenian law courts?
answer: >-
    The role and selection of dikastai (jurors) in the Athenian law courts reflect the sovereignty of these courts in several significant ways. \n\n1. **Citizen Participation**: The dikastai were selected from the citizen body, which emphasized the democratic principle that all citizens had a stake in the judicial process. This selection process was designed to ensure that the power to adjudicate legal disputes rested with the people rather than a select few. Each year, around 6,000 citizens would swear the heliastic oath, committing to serve as jurors, which reinforced the idea that the law courts were a manifestation of the collective will of the citizenry.\n\n2. **Large Juries**: Trials in Athens were conducted by large juries, often comprising hundreds of dikastai. This structure not only allowed for a diverse representation of opinions but also minimized the influence of any single individual, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of the verdicts. The large size of the juries was a safeguard against corruption and bias, as it was believed that a group of randomly selected jurors would be less susceptible to bribery than a smaller, more easily influenced panel.\n\n3. **Use of Kleroterion**: The kleroterion, a device used for the random selection of jurors, further exemplified the democratic nature of the Athenian legal system. By employing sortition, Athens aimed to eliminate favoritism and ensure that all citizens had an equal chance of serving as dikastai. This method of selection underscored the principle of equality among citizens, a cornerstone of Athenian democracy.\n\n4. **Judicial Sovereignty**: The law courts were a powerful institution within the Athenian political system, embodying the concept of popular sovereignty. As Aristotle noted, Solon established the jury-courts to include all citizens, which marked a significant step in the evolution of democracy in Athens. The ability of citizens to serve as jurors and make legal decisions reinforced their authority over the law and governance, making the courts a direct expression of the will of the people.\n\n5. **Frequency of Court Sessions**: The Athenian law courts met frequently, between 175 to 225 days per year, allowing for a continuous engagement of citizens in the judicial process. This high level of participation further solidified the courts' role as a central institution of democracy, where the voice of the citizenry could be heard and acted upon.\n\nIn summary, the role and selection of dikastai in the Athenian law courts were fundamental to the expression of popular sovereignty in Athens. By allowing citizens to participate directly in the judicial process, employing random selection methods, and maintaining large juries, the Athenian legal system ensured that the power to adjudicate was firmly in the hands of the people, reflecting the democratic ideals of the city-state.
