answer: >-
    Johannes Reuchlin defended himself against the papal condemnation primarily through a combination of public advocacy, scholarly support, and appeals to higher authorities. Here are the key elements of his defense:\n\n1. **Public Defense and Scholarly Support**: In 1514, Reuchlin published a collection of letters in his defense, which were written by prominent humanistic scholars across Europe. This collection highlighted the intellectual and moral support he received from the humanist community, which rallied around him in opposition to the Dominican inquisitors who sought to condemn him.\n\n2. **The "Augenspiegel"**: Reuchlin's most famous work, the "Augenspiegel" (or "The Eye of the Eye"), served as a direct response to the attacks from Johannes Pfefferkorn, an anti-Jewish agitator. In this work, Reuchlin articulated his defense of Jewish literature and argued against the confiscation and destruction of Jewish texts, emphasizing the importance of these works for Christian scholarship.\n\n3. **Appeal to Pope Leo X**: When faced with heresy charges initiated by the Dominican inquisitor Jacob Hochstraten in 1513, Reuchlin appealed directly to Pope Leo X. His appeal was significant because Leo X was sympathetic to Reuchlin's position, influenced in part by his Jewish court physician, Bonet de Lattes. This appeal helped to elevate the controversy to a higher ecclesiastical level.\n\n4. **Fifth Lateran Council**: The controversy was eventually submitted to the Fifth Lateran Council, which, in July 1516, sided with Reuchlin. This decision was crucial as it not only acquitted him of heresy but also indicated a shift in the church's stance regarding the treatment of Jewish texts and scholarship.\n\n5. **Widespread Support**: The controversy surrounding Reuchlin's defense of Jewish literature polarized the European intellectual community, with many humanists and scholars supporting him against the Dominicans. This widespread backing helped to legitimize his position and counter the papal condemnation.\n\n6. **Legal and Theological Arguments**: Reuchlin's defense was also grounded in legal and theological arguments. He contended that the charges against him were unfounded and that his advocacy for Jewish texts did not constitute heresy but rather a pursuit of knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn summary, Reuchlin's defense against papal condemnation was multifaceted, involving public advocacy, scholarly support, appeals to the pope, and a strong legal and theological rationale. His efforts not only defended his own position but also contributed to a broader discourse on Christian-Jewish relations and the value of Jewish scholarship in the Renaissance.
