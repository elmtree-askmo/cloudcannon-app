    What is India's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict?
answer: >-
    India's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting a complex balancing act between its historical support for Palestine and its growing relationship with Israel. Historically, India has leaned towards supporting the Palestinian cause, influenced by factors such as Mahatma Gandhi's opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine, the country's large Muslim population, and the necessity of maintaining good relations with Arab nations.\n\nIn recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, India has sought to reaffirm its commitment to a "two-state solution," advocating for a sovereign and viable state of Palestine that coexists peacefully alongside Israel. This position was reiterated during Modi's visit to Ramallah, which aimed to reassure Arab partners that India's closer ties with Israel would not alter its principled support for Palestine.\n\nIndia has also actively participated in international discussions regarding the conflict, voting in favor of resolutions that criticize Israeli settlements in occupied territories and support the socio-economic welfare of the Palestinian people. For instance, India voted for several draft resolutions at the United Nations that addressed issues related to Palestinian refugees and condemned Israeli demolitions of Palestinian villages.\n\nMoreover, India has provided humanitarian assistance to Gaza, including sending medical supplies, which underscores its commitment to supporting the Palestinian people during times of crisis. This dual approach—strengthening ties with Israel while maintaining support for Palestine—illustrates India's strategic autonomy in foreign policy, allowing it to navigate complex geopolitical landscapes while upholding its historical principles.\n\nIn summary, India's current stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict is characterized by a commitment to a two-state solution, support for Palestinian rights, and a pragmatic approach that seeks to balance its relationships with both Israel and Arab nations.
