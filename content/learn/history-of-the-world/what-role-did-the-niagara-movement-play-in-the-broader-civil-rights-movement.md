    What role did the Niagara Movement play in the broader civil rights movement?
answer: >-
    The Niagara Movement played a crucial role in the broader civil rights movement by laying the groundwork for future advocacy and activism aimed at achieving full civil rights for African Americans. Founded in 1905 by W.E.B. Du Bois and a group of 29 prominent Black intellectuals, the movement emerged as a direct response to the racial discrimination and disenfranchisement prevalent during the Jim Crow era.\n\nThe Niagara Movement's manifesto called for full political, civil, and social rights for African Americans, emphasizing the need for civil liberties, the abolition of racial discrimination, and the recognition of human brotherhood. This was a significant departure from the accommodationist approach advocated by contemporaries like Booker T. Washington, who promoted economic self-reliance and gradual progress rather than immediate civil rights.\n\nThe movement held its first public meeting in 1906 at Storer College in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, a site rich in historical significance for African Americans. This gathering not only highlighted the movement's commitment to civil rights but also served as a platform for discussing issues such as education, health, and living standards for African Americans.\n\nAlthough the Niagara Movement disbanded in 1910, its legacy continued through the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909, which incorporated many of the movement's goals and members. The Niagara Movement's emphasis on direct action and civil rights advocacy set the stage for the more organized civil rights efforts that would follow in the decades to come, making it a cornerstone of the modern civil rights movement. \n\nIn summary, the Niagara Movement was instrumental in shaping the discourse around civil rights and provided a foundation for future civil rights organizations, advocating for equality and justice in a time of widespread racial oppression.
