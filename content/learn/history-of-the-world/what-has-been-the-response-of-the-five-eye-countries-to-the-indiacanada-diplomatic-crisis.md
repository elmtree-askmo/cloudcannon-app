    What has been the response of the 'Five Eye' countries to the India-Canada diplomatic crisis?
answer: >-
    The response of the 'Five Eyes' countries—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—to the India-Canada diplomatic crisis has been varied and nuanced. \n\n1. **United States**: The U.S. has urged cooperation and emphasized the importance of respecting Canada's judicial process. A top U.S. diplomat confirmed that Canada received intelligence regarding the alleged involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which has intensified the tensions between India and Canada.\n\n2. **United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand**: These countries have adopted a more restrained tone compared to the U.S. While they have expressed respect for Canada's legal proceedings, they have been cautious in their public statements, likely to avoid escalating the situation further. \n\n3. **General Sentiment**: The diplomatic crisis has raised concerns about India's relationships with the Five Eyes nations, particularly as Canada has classified India as a "state adversary." The allegations against Indian officials threaten India's carefully cultivated diplomatic ties and could impact its standing in international forums, including the G20.\n\nOverall, while the U.S. has taken a more assertive stance in support of Canada, the other Five Eyes nations have opted for a more measured approach, reflecting the complexities of international relations and the need to balance diplomatic interests.
