answer: >-
    The 1924 presidential election, held on November 4, was a significant event in American political history, primarily featuring incumbent Republican President Calvin Coolidge and Democratic nominee John W. Davis, a former ambassador. Here are the key policies and outcomes of the election:\n\n### Key Policies\n\n1. **Calvin Coolidge (Republican)**:\n   - **Economic Policy**: Coolidge was a staunch advocate of laissez-faire economics, promoting limited government intervention in the economy. He supported tax cuts and reduced federal spending, aligning with the broader economic policies of the 1920s that favored business and economic growth.\n   - **Public Image**: Coolidge's quiet demeanor and focus on prosperity resonated with the public, especially in the wake of the scandals that marred the Harding administration. His administration was characterized by a commitment to maintaining economic stability and growth.\n\n2. **John W. Davis (Democrat)**:\n   - Davis's campaign focused on a more interventionist approach to the economy, advocating for reforms that would address the needs of the working class and promote social welfare. However, his message struggled to gain traction against Coolidge's popularity.\n\n3. **Robert M. La Follette (Progressive)**:\n   - Running as a third-party candidate, La Follette captured a significant portion of the vote (about one-sixth of the popular vote). His campaign emphasized progressive reforms, including labor rights and anti-monopoly measures, reflecting the growing divide within the Republican Party and the broader electorate.\n\n### Outcomes\n\n- **Election Results**: Calvin Coolidge won the election decisively, securing a full term with a substantial margin in both the popular and electoral votes. His victory reaffirmed the Republican Party's dominance during the 1920s.\n- **Political Landscape**: The election solidified the Republican control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, continuing the trend of conservative governance that characterized the decade.\n- **Impact on Future Elections**: The 1924 election highlighted the polarization within American politics, particularly with the presence of a strong third-party candidate. This polarization would continue to shape future electoral dynamics.\n\nOverall, the 1924 election was marked by a focus on economic prosperity and a conservative approach to governance, setting the stage for the policies and political climate of the late 1920s.
