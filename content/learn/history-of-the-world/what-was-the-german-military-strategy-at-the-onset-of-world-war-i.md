    What was the German military strategy at the onset of World War I?
answer: >-
    At the onset of World War I, the German military strategy was primarily based on the Schlieffen Plan, which was developed by Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen in 1905. This plan aimed to enable Germany to effectively wage a two-front war against France in the west and Russia in the east. The core idea was to quickly defeat France by invading through Belgium, thereby avoiding a prolonged conflict on two fronts.\n\nThe Schlieffen Plan proposed that Germany would first launch a rapid offensive against France, capturing Paris and forcing a swift surrender. This would allow German forces to then redirect their attention to the eastern front against Russia, which was expected to mobilize more slowly. However, the plan was heavily modified by Schlieffen's successor, Helmuth von Moltke, who reduced the size of the forces allocated for the initial attack on France and altered the execution of the plan.\n\nDespite its initial intentions, the Schlieffen Plan ultimately failed due to several factors, including unexpected resistance from Belgian forces, the rapid mobilization of British and French troops, and logistical challenges. The failure to achieve a quick victory led to a protracted stalemate on the Western Front, characterized by trench warfare.\n\nIn summary, the German military strategy at the onset of World War I revolved around the Schlieffen Plan, which aimed for a quick victory over France before turning to face Russia. However, modifications to the plan and unforeseen circumstances contributed to its failure, leading to a drawn-out conflict.
