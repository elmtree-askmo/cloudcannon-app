    Which constitutional amendments have significantly affected voting rights in the United States?
answer: >-
    Several constitutional amendments have significantly affected voting rights in the United States, reflecting the ongoing struggle for civil rights and the importance of ensuring equal access to the electoral process. The key amendments include:\n\n1. **15th Amendment (1870)**: This amendment prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude." It was a crucial step in the post-Civil War era aimed at securing voting rights for African American men.\n\n2. **19th Amendment (1920)**: This amendment grants women the right to vote, prohibiting any U.S. citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. It marked a significant victory for the women's suffrage movement.\n\n3. **24th Amendment (1964)**: This amendment eliminates poll taxes in federal elections, which were used to restrict voting rights, particularly among low-income individuals and African Americans. The Supreme Court later extended this prohibition to state elections as well.\n\n4. **26th Amendment (1971)**: This amendment lowers the voting age to 18 years, ensuring that younger citizens have the right to participate in elections. It was largely influenced by arguments that those who are old enough to be drafted for military service should also have the right to vote.\n\nThese amendments collectively represent critical milestones in the evolution of voting rights in the United States, addressing various forms of discrimination and expanding the electorate to include previously marginalized groups.
