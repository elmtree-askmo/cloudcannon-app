    What were the main goals of the Knights of Labor, and how did they address economic inequality?
answer: >-
    The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, aimed to address various issues related to economic inequality and the rights of workers during the Second Industrial Revolution. Their main goals included:\n\n1. **Wage Increases**: One of the primary objectives was to secure fair wages that reflected the cost of living and the value of the work performed. This was crucial in combating the economic disparities that many workers faced.\n\n2. **Shorter Workdays**: The Knights advocated for reduced working hours, specifically pushing for an eight-hour workday as a standard. This demand was rooted in the belief that workers deserved a better work-life balance and more time for personal pursuits.\n\n3. **Job Security**: Ensuring job security was another significant goal. The Knights sought to protect workers from arbitrary dismissal and to promote stable employment, which was essential for economic stability and personal well-being.\n\n4. **Collective Bargaining**: The movement emphasized the importance of collective bargaining, allowing workers to negotiate as a group with employers rather than as individuals. This approach aimed to empower workers and provide them with a stronger voice in the workplace.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Diverse Workers**: The Knights of Labor aimed to include all workers, regardless of skill level, gender, or race, in their ranks. This inclusivity reflected a broader vision of labor solidarity and sought to unite workers across different backgrounds to fight against economic inequality.\n\nThe Knights of Labor also launched a sustained assault on the prevailing notions of freedom grounded in Social Darwinism and the concept of liberty of contract. They argued that unrestrained economic growth and political corruption had led to a loss of control over economic livelihoods for ordinary Americans. By advocating for economic rights and reforms, they sought to engraft republican principles into the industrial system, thereby addressing the extremes of wealth and poverty that threatened democratic governance.\n\nIn summary, the Knights of Labor addressed economic inequality through their advocacy for fair wages, shorter workdays, job security, collective bargaining, and the inclusion of diverse workers, all while challenging the socio-economic structures that perpetuated inequality.
