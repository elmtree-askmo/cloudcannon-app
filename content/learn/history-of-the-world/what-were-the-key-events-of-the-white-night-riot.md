answer: >-
    The White Night Riots were a significant series of events that took place on May 21, 1979, in San Francisco, sparked by the announcement of a lenient sentencing for Dan White, who had assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. The key events of the riots can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Background of the Assassinations**: On November 27, 1978, Dan White entered San Francisco City Hall and shot both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk, the latter being one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. This act shocked the city and the nation, particularly the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n2. **Trial and Verdict**: During White's trial, his defense famously employed the "Twinkie Defense," arguing that his mental state was impaired due to a diet high in junk food, which they claimed contributed to his actions. On May 21, 1979, the jury convicted White of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, resulting in a sentence of just over seven years.\n\n3. **Outrage and Protests**: The verdict was met with widespread outrage, particularly from the LGBTQ+ community, who felt that the justice system had failed them. In response, thousands gathered in the Castro District to protest the lenient sentence.\n\n4. **Escalation into Riots**: What began as a peaceful march quickly escalated into violence. Protesters clashed with police, leading to significant property damage in both the Civic Center and Castro districts. Rioters vandalized police cars, broke windows, and set fires, resulting in numerous arrests.\n\n5. **Aftermath**: The riots highlighted the deep-seated frustrations within the LGBTQ+ community regarding systemic injustice and discrimination. The events of that night became a pivotal moment in the history of LGBTQ+ rights, galvanizing activism and leading to increased visibility for the community.\n\nThe White Night Riots are remembered not only for the violence that erupted but also for their role in catalyzing the gay rights movement in San Francisco and beyond, marking a significant moment in the struggle for equality and justice.
