    How does realism view U.S. relations with Haiti?
answer: >-
    Realism, as a theory in international relations, emphasizes the role of power and national interest in shaping state behavior. When applied to U.S. relations with Haiti, realism would likely focus on several key aspects:\n\n1. **Strategic Interests**: The United States views Haiti as a close neighbor whose stability is crucial for U.S. national security. Given Haiti's proximity, instability, and vulnerability to natural disasters, the U.S. has a vested interest in fostering a more secure and prosperous Haiti. Realists would argue that U.S. engagement in Haiti is driven by the need to prevent potential threats, such as mass migration or the spread of instability, which could affect U.S. interests in the Caribbean.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The historical relationship between the U.S. and Haiti has been marked by intervention and control, particularly during the U.S. occupation from 1915 to 1934. Realists would interpret these actions as efforts by the U.S. to exert influence and maintain stability in a region that it considers vital to its own security. The U.S. has intervened in Haiti multiple times throughout the 20th century, reflecting a realist approach to managing perceived threats and ensuring favorable conditions for U.S. interests.\n\n3. **Policy Objectives**: U.S. policy towards Haiti aims to promote democracy and economic development, which are seen as essential for long-term stability. Realists might argue that while these objectives are framed in humanitarian terms, they ultimately serve U.S. interests by creating a more stable and cooperative neighbor. The U.S. is the largest donor of humanitarian and development aid to Haiti, which can be viewed as a strategic investment in the country's future.\n\n4. **Current Challenges**: The political instability following the assassination of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se and the ongoing crises in Haiti highlight the complexities of U.S. involvement. Realists would likely argue that the U.S. must balance its humanitarian goals with the need to maintain influence and stability in the region, especially in light of Haiti's lack of an elected government and ongoing challenges.\n\nIn summary, realism would interpret U.S. relations with Haiti through the lens of national interest, power dynamics, and historical context, emphasizing the importance of stability and security in shaping U.S. policy decisions.
