    What recent railway incidents have occurred in India?
answer: >-
    Recent railway incidents in India have raised significant concerns regarding rail safety. The most notable incident occurred on June 2, 2023, in Balasore district, Odisha, where a tragic three-way collision involving the Coromandel Express, a passenger train, and a stationary goods train resulted in at least 296 fatalities and over 700 injuries. This incident is considered one of the deadliest rail accidents in Indian history.\n\nIn addition to the Balasore collision, there have been other serious railway accidents in recent years. For instance, in October 2018, a train ran over a crowd during a religious festival in Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 60 people. Furthermore, in November 2016, a train accident resulted in the deaths of at least 146 individuals.\n\nDespite these tragic events, it is worth noting that the overall number of train accidents in India has seen a significant decline. According to the Ministry of Railways, the number of consequential train accidents fell sharply from 135 in the 2014-15 fiscal year to just 40 in 2023-24, indicating improvements in railway safety measures.\n\nThe Indian Railways has been actively working to enhance safety through various initiatives, including the implementation of advanced signaling systems and modernization of infrastructure. However, the recent incidents highlight the ongoing challenges and the need for continued focus on safety improvements within the railway system.
