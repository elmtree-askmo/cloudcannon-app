    What is the background of the release of Indians from the Russian army?
answer: >-
    The background of the release of Indians from the Russian army is rooted in a series of diplomatic engagements between India and Russia, particularly highlighted during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow. In July, following discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia promised an early release of all Indians who had been fighting in its army. This promise was made in response to concerns raised by the Indian government regarding its nationals who had been misled into joining the Russian military.\n\nMany of these individuals were reportedly lured to Russia under the pretense of non-combat jobs, such as security positions, but were subsequently forced into active combat roles in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Indian government has been actively seeking the release of these individuals, with reports indicating that at least 69 Indians had been recruited into the Russian army. As of recent updates, India's foreign ministry announced that 45 of these men had been discharged and were awaiting their return home, while efforts were ongoing to secure the release of an additional 50 individuals.\n\nThe situation has been complicated by reports of some Indian nationals still being missing after being fraudulently enlisted and sent to the frontlines. The Indian government has expressed its commitment to ensuring the safe return of its citizens, emphasizing the need for vigilance against such deceptive recruitment practices.
