    How did the Oscar Mack Project impact the families directly involved in the historical incidents?
answer: >-
    The Oscar Mack Project has had a significant impact on the families directly involved in the historical incidents surrounding Oscar Mack's life and the racial violence he faced. This project, which began as a class assignment in 2013, aimed to uncover the details of Mack's life, particularly his escape from a lynch mob and the subsequent events that shaped his legacy.\n\nOne of the most profound impacts of the project has been the opportunity for descendants of Oscar Mack and other families affected by the racial violence to come together and engage in dialogue. For instance, at a documentary premiere, the descendants of Oscar Mack and Stewart Ivey, a Klansman Mack killed, met in person for the first time. This meeting symbolized a step towards reconciliation and understanding, allowing families to confront their shared history and the legacies of violence and trauma that have persisted over generations.\n\nThe project also facilitated interviews with descendants and community members, which helped to document personal narratives and experiences related to the historical events. These oral histories not only serve to preserve the memory of those involved but also provide a platform for healing and education about the impacts of racial violence on families and communities.\n\nFurthermore, the project has contributed to a broader understanding of racial tensions in Central Florida, linking past events to contemporary issues of racism and discrimination. By engaging students and community members in research and discovery, the Oscar Mack Project has fostered a collaborative environment that emphasizes the importance of education and awareness in addressing historical injustices.\n\nOverall, the Oscar Mack Project has played a crucial role in impacting the families involved by promoting dialogue, reconciliation, and a deeper understanding of their shared history, ultimately aiming to bring closure and healing to those affected by the legacy of racial violence.
