    How did regional and international actors react to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict?
answer: >-
    The Israel-Hezbollah conflict has elicited a range of reactions from regional and international actors, particularly in light of the recent escalation and subsequent ceasefire agreements. \n\n1. **Iran's Support for Hezbollah**: Following the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iran expressed strong support for Hezbollah, pledging to continue its "holy war" against Israel. This reflects Iran's longstanding alliance with Hezbollah and its commitment to opposing Israeli actions in the region.\n\n2. **International Condemnation of Israeli Actions**: Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Israel's military actions, calling for an end to hostilities in Lebanon. This highlights the geopolitical tensions surrounding the conflict, with Russia positioning itself as a defender of Lebanese sovereignty against Israeli aggression.\n\n3. **U.S. Involvement and Ceasefire Negotiations**: The United States played a crucial role in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah after 14 months of conflict. President Joe Biden announced the terms of the ceasefire, which included a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and restrictions on Hezbollah's military entrenchment near the Israeli border. This diplomatic effort underscores the U.S.'s strategic interest in stabilizing the region and preventing further escalation.\n\n4. **European Support for Ceasefire**: French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the importance of the ceasefire and pledged support for its implementation, including assistance to the Lebanese army. This indicates a broader European interest in maintaining peace and security in Lebanon and the surrounding areas.\n\n5. **Regional Concerns about Escalation**: The conflict has raised fears of a wider regional war, with many actors in the Middle East concerned about the implications of a full-scale conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The displacement of civilians and the potential for increased violence have prompted calls for restraint from various regional leaders.\n\n6. **Humanitarian Impact**: The conflict has resulted in significant casualties and displacement, with over 3,700 reported deaths in Lebanon and around 80 in northern Israel. This humanitarian crisis has drawn attention from international organizations and human rights groups, urging for immediate relief efforts and a lasting resolution to the conflict.\n\nIn summary, the reactions to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict reflect a complex interplay of support, condemnation, and diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a ceasefire and preventing further escalation. The involvement of major powers like the U.S. and Russia, along with regional dynamics, continues to shape the trajectory of this ongoing conflict.
