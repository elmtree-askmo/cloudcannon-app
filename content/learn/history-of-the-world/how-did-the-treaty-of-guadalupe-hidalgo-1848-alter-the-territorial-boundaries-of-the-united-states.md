    How did the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) alter the territorial boundaries of the United States?
answer: >-
    The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, significantly altered the territorial boundaries of the United States by ending the Mexican-American War and resulting in the U.S. acquisition of approximately 500,000 square miles of territory. This treaty marked a pivotal moment in U.S. history, as it expanded the nation's borders and fulfilled the concept of Manifest Destiny, the belief that the U.S. was destined to expand across the North American continent.\n\nAs part of the treaty, the United States acquired the following territories:\n\n1. **California**: This acquisition included the entire state, which was rich in resources and later became a focal point during the Gold Rush.\n2. **Arizona**: The territory that would become Arizona was included, providing access to valuable minerals and land.\n3. **New Mexico**: This area was also part of the acquisition, which had been a point of contention during the war.\n4. **Nevada**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the treaty, the land that would become Nevada was included in the broader territorial gains.\n5. **Utah**: Similar to Nevada, parts of what would become Utah were also acquired.\n6. **Parts of Colorado and Wyoming**: The treaty extended U.S. territory into parts of these states as well.\n\nIn exchange for these territories, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million and assumed certain claims of American citizens against Mexico, which amounted to about $3.25 million. This acquisition not only expanded the U.S. territory significantly but also intensified debates over slavery and statehood for the new territories, contributing to the sectional tensions that would eventually lead to the Civil War.\n\nOverall, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was a crucial event that reshaped the geographical and political landscape of the United States, establishing it as a continental power and setting the stage for future conflicts over the expansion of slavery and the rights of new territories.
