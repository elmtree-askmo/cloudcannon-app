    What are the legends or myths surrounding the Stone of Destiny?
answer: >-
    The Stone of Destiny, also known as the Stone of Scone, is steeped in rich legends and myths that contribute to its significance in Scottish history and culture. Here are some of the notable legends surrounding this ancient artifact:\n\n1. **Pharaoh's Daughter Scota**: One of the prominent legends suggests that the Stone of Destiny was brought to Scotland by Scota, the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh. According to this myth, Scota and her followers carried the stone as they migrated to the British Isles, where it became a symbol of kingship and sovereignty.\n\n2. **Spanish Prince Simon Brecc**: Another legend attributes the stone's origins to Simon Brecc, a Spanish prince. This tale posits that the stone was used in ancient rituals and was believed to possess supernatural powers, further enhancing its status as a sacred object.\n\n3. **Supernatural Powers**: Various myths also suggest that the Stone of Destiny had the ability to roar or cry out when a true king touched it. This belief reinforced the idea that the stone was not merely a physical object but a divine symbol of legitimacy and authority for the rulers of Scotland.\n\n4. **Hiding of the Stone**: Following its removal by King Edward I of England in 1296, there were rumors that the real Stone of Destiny had been hidden by monks at Scone Abbey. It was said that they either buried it or concealed it in a river to protect it from English dominance, leading to speculation about the authenticity of the stone displayed at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThese legends and myths not only highlight the Stone of Destiny's importance as a symbol of Scottish identity and monarchy but also reflect the deep-rooted cultural narratives that have evolved around it throughout history. The stone's return to Scotland in 1996 marked a significant moment, symbolizing the nation's resilience and connection to its ancient heritage.
