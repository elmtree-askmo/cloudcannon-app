    How did the structure of the Athenian government function, particularly the roles of the Assembly and Council?
answer: >-
    The structure of the Athenian government was characterized by a unique form of direct democracy, primarily involving two key institutions: the Assembly (Ekklesia) and the Council (Boule).\n\n### The Assembly (Ekklesia)\nThe Assembly was the principal democratic institution in Athens, where all male citizens over the age of 18 could gather to discuss and decide on public matters. It met regularly on the Pnyx hill, a location that could accommodate thousands of participants. The Assembly was responsible for a wide range of functions, including:\n\n- **Legislative Authority**: Citizens could propose legislation, debate issues, and vote on important matters such as laws, war, and foreign policy. This direct participation allowed the Assembly to reflect the collective will of the citizenry.\n  \n- **Decision-Making**: Major decisions required a quorum, ensuring that a significant portion of the citizenry was involved in the decision-making process. Voting was typically conducted through a show of hands or the use of pebbles.\n\n- **Civic Engagement**: The Assembly served as a forum for public discourse, where citizens exercised their rights to speak, debate, and vote. This open-air setting fostered a vibrant exchange of ideas and reinforced the democratic ethos of participation and accountability.\n\n### The Council (Boule)\nThe Boule was a council of 500 citizens chosen by lot, which played a crucial role in the functioning of Athenian democracy. Each of the ten tribes of Athens contributed 50 members to the Boule, ensuring broad representation. The key functions of the Boule included:\n\n- **Agenda Preparation**: The Boule prepared the agenda for the Assembly, reviewing proposals and ensuring that only well-considered matters were presented for discussion. This helped streamline the legislative process and manage the day-to-day affairs of the city.\n\n- **Oversight**: The Boule acted as a check on the Assembly by overseeing the execution of its decisions and managing public finances. This role was essential in maintaining accountability within the government.\n\n### Conclusion\nTogether, the Assembly and the Boule formed the backbone of Athenian democracy, allowing for direct citizen participation in governance. The Assembly served as the main forum for decision-making, while the Boule facilitated the legislative process and ensured effective administration. This structure not only promoted democratic ideals but also reinforced the principle of equality among citizens, as all male citizens had the opportunity to engage in the political life of Athens.
