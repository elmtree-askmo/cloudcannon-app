    What was the structure of the disputation between Maharal and the priests?
answer: >-
    The structure of the disputation between the Maharal of Prague and the priests was carefully organized to facilitate a thorough examination of the blood libel accusations against Jews. Here are the key elements of the disputation's structure:\n\n1. **Format**: The Maharal proposed a thirty-day written debate. This format was chosen to manage the complexity of addressing a large audience of priests effectively.\n\n2. **Daily Participation**: Each day, ten priests would present their questions and claims in writing. This approach allowed for a focused discussion on specific points raised by the priests.\n\n3. **Written Responses**: The Maharal would respond in writing to the questions posed by the priests each day. This method ensured that his responses could be carefully considered and documented, providing a clear record of the arguments made.\n\n4. **Cardinal's Role**: Cardinal Jan Salvester facilitated the organization of the disputation, acting as a mediator between the Maharal and the priests.\n\nThis structured approach not only aimed to address the blood libel accusations but also allowed for a more organized and respectful exchange of ideas, which was crucial given the sensitive nature of the topic and the historical context of Jewish persecution. The involvement of the Jewish community, through spiritual practices such as reciting the Book of Psalms and fasting, further underscored the significance of this event in their collective struggle against false accusations.
