    What role did the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) play after its creation in 1935?
answer: >-
    The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), created in 1935 under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), plays a crucial role in the enforcement of labor laws in the United States. Its primary functions include:\n\n1. **Protecting Employee Rights**: The NLRB safeguards the rights of employees to organize, engage in collective bargaining, and participate in union activities without fear of retaliation from employers. This was a significant shift in labor policy, as it aimed to promote workplace democracy and empower workers.\n\n2. **Supervising Union Elections**: The NLRB is responsible for conducting secret-ballot elections to determine whether employees wish to be represented by a union. This process ensures that employees can make their choice free from coercion or undue influence from employers.\n\n3. **Investigating Unfair Labor Practices**: The NLRB has the authority to investigate complaints regarding unfair labor practices by employers or unions. This includes actions that may interfere with employees' rights to organize or that violate the provisions of the NLRA.\n\n4. **Remedying Violations**: If the NLRB finds that unfair labor practices have occurred, it can take remedial actions to address these violations. This may involve ordering employers to reinstate employees who were wrongfully terminated or to cease certain practices that infringe on workers' rights.\n\n5. **Promoting Collective Bargaining**: The NLRB's enforcement of the NLRA has contributed to a significant increase in union membership, rising from 11% in 1935 to 35% by 1945, reflecting the agency's impact on labor relations in the United States.\n\nOverall, the NLRB has been instrumental in shaping labor law and ensuring that employees have the necessary protections to advocate for their rights in the workplace. Its establishment marked a pivotal moment in U.S. labor history, reinforcing the importance of collective bargaining and the rights of workers.
