    What is the background of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)?
answer: >-
    The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is an intergovernmental organization that was established on June 15, 2001, in Shanghai, China. It emerged as a successor to the Shanghai Five, which was formed in 1996 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. The primary aim of the SCO is to promote cooperation and peace among its member states, as well as to foster a new democratic, fair, and rational international political and economic order.\n\nThe founding members of the SCO included China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Over the years, the organization has expanded its membership to include India and Pakistan in 2017, and Iran in 2023. The SCO is notable for being the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope and population, covering approximately 24% of the world's area (65% of Eurasia) and 42% of the global population.\n\nThe SCO's main objectives include strengthening mutual confidence and good-neighborly relations among member countries, promoting effective cooperation in various fields such as politics, trade, economy, science and technology, culture, education, energy, transportation, tourism, and environmental protection. Additionally, the organization aims to make joint efforts to maintain peace, security, and stability in the region.\n\nThe SCO has evolved into a significant regional organization in Eurasia, attracting increasing attention from both member states and observers worldwide. Its development can be understood in terms of the stages before and after 2017, with the founding phase (2001-2004) introducing the "Shanghai Spirit," which emphasizes mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for cultural diversity, and the pursuit of common development.
