    How did Jahanpanah serve the rulers of Delhi?
answer: >-
    Jahanpanah, established by Muhammad bin Tughlaq between 1326 and 1327, served the rulers of Delhi primarily as a fortified refuge against the persistent threat of Mongol invasions. The name "Jahanpanah" translates to "Refuge of the World" in Persian, reflecting its purpose as a safe haven for the Sultan and his subjects.\n\nThe city was strategically constructed to unify and fortify the existing urban settlements in the area, including the Adilabad Fort, which was incorporated into its design. This fortification was crucial for the defense of the city, as Tughlaq aimed to protect his realm from external threats while also consolidating power within the region. By creating Jahanpanah, Tughlaq not only addressed immediate security concerns but also sought to enhance the political and administrative significance of Delhi as a capital.\n\nMoreover, Jahanpanah represented a significant architectural and urban planning achievement of the Tughlaq dynasty, showcasing the ruler's ambition to create a modern city that could withstand invasions and serve as a center of governance. The establishment of Jahanpanah marked a pivotal moment in the historical development of Delhi, reflecting the changing dynamics of power and the need for fortified urban spaces during a tumultuous period in Indian history. \n\nIn summary, Jahanpanah served the rulers of Delhi by providing a fortified urban center that enhanced security, consolidated power, and reflected the architectural ambitions of the Tughlaq dynasty amidst the challenges posed by external threats.
