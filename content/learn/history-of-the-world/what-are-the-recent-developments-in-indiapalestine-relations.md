    What are the recent developments in India-Palestine relations?
answer: >-
    Recent developments in India-Palestine relations reflect a complex and evolving foreign policy landscape, particularly in light of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict that escalated in October 2023. Historically, India has maintained a strong stance in support of Palestinian self-determination, which has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy for decades. This support includes advocating for a negotiated settlement that respects the rights of both Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nIn recent months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has sought to balance its relationships with both Israel and Palestine. Modi's visit to Ramallah underscored India's commitment to the establishment of a "sovereign, independent Palestine living in an environment of peace." This visit was significant as it aimed to reassure Arab partners that India's growing ties with Israel would not compromise its principled position on Palestine.\n\nIndia's approach to the Israel-Gaza war has been characterized by a nuanced shift. While India has historically supported Palestine, it has also engaged in arms exports to Israel during the conflict, reflecting a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy. This dual approach allows India to maintain its long-standing ties with Arab nations while also strengthening its relationship with Israel.\n\nMoreover, India's Ministry of External Affairs has reiterated its call for the establishment of a viable Palestinian state and has condemned civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict. The Indian government has also expressed its commitment to sending humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, further emphasizing its support for their plight.\n\nPublic sentiment in India, particularly in states like Kerala, remains strongly in favor of the Palestinian cause, as evidenced by large solidarity marches and political support from various parties. This grassroots support highlights the enduring connection between India and Palestine, despite the complexities of international relations.\n\nIn summary, India's recent developments in its relations with Palestine reflect a careful balancing act between its historical support for Palestinian rights and its strategic partnerships in the region, particularly with Israel. The situation continues to evolve, influenced by regional dynamics and the broader geopolitical landscape.
