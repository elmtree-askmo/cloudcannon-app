    What were the immediate consequences of the Haymarket Affair on labor movements?
answer: >-
    The immediate consequences of the Haymarket Affair on labor movements were significant and multifaceted, leading to both a setback for existing labor organizations and the emergence of new ones. \n\n1. **Increased Anti-Labor Sentiment**: The Haymarket Affair, which culminated in violence on May 4, 1886, created widespread panic and hysteria, particularly in Chicago. This event heightened anti-labor and anti-immigrant sentiments across the United States, as many labor leaders involved were anarchist immigrants from Germany. The public's fear linked labor activism with anarchism, leading to a backlash against labor movements.\n\n2. **Decline of the Knights of Labor**: The Knights of Labor, which was the largest union organization at the time, faced a dramatic decline in influence and membership following the Haymarket Affair. The organization had initially seen a surge in membership, reaching around 700,000 by the end of 1886, but the violent events and subsequent public hysteria led to a significant drop in its standing and numbers.\n\n3. **Formation of the American Federation of Labor**: In the wake of the Haymarket Affair, a new labor organization, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), was formed at the end of 1886. This organization focused on more pragmatic goals and sought to distance itself from the radical elements associated with the Haymarket Affair, thereby marking a shift in labor organizing strategies.\n\n4. **Legal Repercussions and Trials**: The aftermath of the Haymarket Affair included the highly controversial trial of eight anarchists, known as the "Chicago Eight," who were convicted of murder despite a lack of solid evidence linking them to the bombing. This trial was viewed by many as a miscarriage of justice and contributed to the perception of labor activists as criminals, further alienating the labor movement from mainstream society.\n\n5. **Long-term Symbolism**: Despite the immediate setbacks, the Haymarket Affair became a symbol of the struggle for workers' rights and is commemorated internationally as May Day (International Workers' Day). This event highlighted the ongoing issues of working conditions, wage cuts, and the need for labor organizing, which continued to resonate in labor movements both in the U.S. and globally.\n\nIn summary, the Haymarket Affair had profound immediate consequences for labor movements, leading to increased repression, a decline in the influence of the Knights of Labor, the formation of the AFL, and a lasting legacy that would shape labor activism for years to come.
