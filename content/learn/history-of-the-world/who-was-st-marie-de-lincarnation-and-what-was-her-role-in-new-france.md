    Who was St. Marie de l’Incarnation, and what was her role in New France?
answer: >-
    St. Marie de l'Incarnation, born Marie Guyart on October 28, 1599, in Tours, France, was a prominent figure in the early history of New France. She is best known as the founder of the Ursuline Order in Canada and played a crucial role in the spread of Catholicism and education among both French and Indigenous populations in the region.\n\nIn 1639, Marie de l'Incarnation traveled to New France with a group of Ursuline nuns, including Marie de Saint-Joseph and Cécile de Sainte-Croix. Upon her arrival in Quebec City, she established the first convent dedicated to the education of girls in North America, which marked a significant development in the educational landscape of the colony. This institution not only served French girls but also Indigenous girls, reflecting her commitment to inclusivity and cultural exchange.\n\nMarie de l'Incarnation was also a prolific writer. Her letters and writings provide invaluable insights into the daily life and challenges of the early settlers in New France, as well as her spiritual experiences and visions. These documents are considered some of the most important accounts of the founding of the colony and the establishment of its religious and educational institutions.\n\nHer contributions to education and her role as a missionary earned her recognition within the Catholic Church, and she was canonized as a saint in 2014. Marie de l'Incarnation's legacy continues to be celebrated for her pioneering efforts in education and her dedication to her faith and community in the early years of New France. She passed away on April 30, 1672, in Quebec City, leaving behind a lasting impact on the region's cultural and religious landscape.
