    What are the main assumptions of realism in international relations?
answer: >-
    Realism in international relations is a theoretical framework that emphasizes several core assumptions about the nature of international politics. The main assumptions of realism can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Anarchy**: Realists view the international system as anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority that governs interactions between states. In this self-help system, states must rely on their own capabilities to ensure their survival and security.\n\n2. **State as the Primary Actor**: The nation-state is considered the principal actor in international relations. While other entities, such as individuals and organizations, exist, their influence is limited compared to that of states.\n\n3. **Unitary Actor**: States are treated as unitary actors, meaning they are seen as coherent entities that act in their national interest. This perspective assumes that states have a common set of interests and goals, which guide their actions on the international stage.\n\n4. **Rationality**: States are viewed as rational actors that make decisions based on a calculated assessment of their interests, primarily focusing on power and security.\n\n5. **Power and National Interest**: Realism posits that the pursuit of power is a fundamental aspect of state behavior. States act to maximize their power and ensure their national interests, often leading to competition and conflict.\n\n6. **Survival**: The ultimate goal of states is survival in an anarchic international system. This drives states to seek security and engage in power politics to protect themselves from potential threats.\n\nThese assumptions form the foundation of realism and help explain the competitive and often conflictual nature of international relations, where states navigate a landscape shaped by power dynamics and national interests.
