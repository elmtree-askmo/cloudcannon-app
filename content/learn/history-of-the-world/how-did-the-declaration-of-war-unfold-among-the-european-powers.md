    How did the declaration of war unfold among the European powers?
answer: >-
    The declaration of war among European powers in 1914 unfolded in a series of rapid and interconnected events, primarily triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914. This assassination set off a diplomatic crisis known as the July Crisis, which escalated tensions among the major powers of Europe.\n\n1. **Austria-Hungary's Declaration on Serbia**: On July 23, 1914, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which contained demands that were intentionally harsh. Serbia's response was deemed insufficient, leading Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. This marked the official beginning of World War I.\n\n2. **The Domino Effect of Alliances**: The declaration of war triggered a chain reaction due to the complex system of alliances in place. On August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia, which had mobilized in defense of Serbia. Following this, on August 3, Germany declared war on France, and on August 4, Germany invaded Belgium, prompting Britain to declare war on Germany the same day.\n\n3. **Further Declarations**: The escalation continued with Austria-Hungary declaring war on Russia on August 5, and Serbia declaring war on Germany on August 6. Montenegro also declared war on Austria-Hungary on August 7. By mid-August, the conflict had expanded significantly, with France and Great Britain declaring war on Austria-Hungary on August 10 and 12, respectively.\n\n4. **Global Involvement**: As the war progressed, other nations joined the conflict. Japan declared war on Germany on August 23, and the Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of the Central Powers in late October 1914.\n\nThe intricate web of alliances, along with nationalistic fervor and imperial ambitions, contributed to the rapid escalation of the conflict, transforming a regional dispute into a global war. The declarations of war were not merely isolated events but part of a larger pattern of military and diplomatic maneuvers that characterized the early stages of World War I.
