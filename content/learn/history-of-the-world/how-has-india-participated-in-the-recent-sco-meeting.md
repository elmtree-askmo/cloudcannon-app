    How has India participated in the recent SCO meeting?
answer: >-
    India has actively participated in the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting, particularly by hosting the 23rd Summit of the SCO Council of Heads of State on July 4, 2023. This summit was significant as it marked India's first-ever chairmanship of the SCO since it became a full member in 2017. The meeting was conducted in a virtual format and included participation from all SCO member states, which are China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran.\n\nDuring the summit, the leaders emphasized the need for a "more representative" and multipolar world order, reflecting the global interest in enhancing cooperation among member states. The theme of the summit was "Towards a SECURE SCO," focusing on security, cooperation, and shared responsibilities among the member countries. \n\nIndia's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, highlighted the constructive contributions made by India during the discussions and noted the signing of eight outcome documents that encapsulated the summit's key takeaways. This participation underscores India's growing role and influence within the SCO framework, as it also holds the presidency of the G20 in the same year, further enhancing its diplomatic engagement on multiple international platforms. \n\nOverall, India's involvement in the SCO meeting illustrates its commitment to fostering regional cooperation and addressing shared challenges among member states.
