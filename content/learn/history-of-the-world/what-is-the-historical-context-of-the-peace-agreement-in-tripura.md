    What is the historical context of the peace agreement in Tripura?
answer: >-
    The historical context of the peace agreement in Tripura is rooted in a prolonged conflict that spanned over 35 years, primarily involving insurgent groups such as the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF). This conflict was characterized by demands for the rights and recognition of the indigenous people of Tripura, particularly concerning issues related to illegal migration, land rights, and political representation.\n\nThe ATTF was formed in 1990, advocating for the removal of illegal migrants from electoral rolls and the full implementation of the 'Tripura Merger Agreement' of 1949. The insurgency gained momentum in the late 1980s, leading to significant violence and instability in the region. The situation necessitated a series of negotiations and agreements aimed at restoring peace and addressing the grievances of the indigenous population.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, a landmark peace agreement was signed in New Delhi between the Government of India, the Government of Tripura, and the insurgent groups NLFT and ATTF. This agreement marked a pivotal moment in Tripura's history, officially ending the 34-year-long insurgency. The accord not only aimed to renounce violence but also committed to building a prosperous and developed Tripura, addressing historical grievances related to land, political rights, economic development, and cultural identity.\n\nThe peace agreement is part of a broader initiative by the Indian government to resolve conflicts in the Northeastern region, with this being the twelfth such agreement aimed at fostering peace and stability. The successful negotiation of this accord is seen as a significant step towards reconciliation and the reintegration of former insurgents into mainstream society, with approximately 10,000 insurgents having laid down their arms in recent years as part of the peace process.
