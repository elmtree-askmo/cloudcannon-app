    How did Canada respond to the expulsion of its diplomats by India?
answer: >-
    In response to the expulsion of its diplomats by India, Canada announced the expulsion of six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner. This action was taken after Canadian authorities accused agents of the Indian government of being involved in serious criminal activities, including homicides and harassment targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reported evidence of violent extremism linked to Indian government agents, which they claimed posed a threat to public safety in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian government characterized the expelled diplomats as part of a broader criminal network orchestrated by the Indian government to intimidate critics, particularly those associated with the Sikh separatist movement. This diplomatic row escalated following the assassination of a Sikh activist in Canada, which had already strained relations between the two countries.\n\nIn a reciprocal move, India had previously communicated its intention to remove immunities for most Canadian diplomats in New Delhi, further intensifying the diplomatic tensions. The situation reflects a significant deterioration in the historically cordial relationship between India and Canada, with both nations taking strong stances against each other's diplomatic personnel.
