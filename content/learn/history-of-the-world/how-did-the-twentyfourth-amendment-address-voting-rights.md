    How did the Twenty-Fourth Amendment address voting rights?
answer: >-
    The Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on January 23, 1964, was a significant milestone in the fight for voting rights, particularly aimed at eliminating economic barriers to voting. Specifically, it prohibits both Congress and the states from requiring the payment of a poll tax or any other tax as a condition for voting in federal elections. This amendment was a response to the discriminatory practices that had been employed, particularly in Southern states, to disenfranchise low-income citizens, including many African Americans.\n\nBefore the amendment, many states imposed a poll tax, which required voters to pay a fee in order to cast their ballots. This practice effectively barred many low-income individuals from participating in elections, as they could not afford to pay the tax. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment made it illegal to charge any voter for the right to vote in federal elections, thereby expanding access to the electoral process.\n\nWhile the amendment was a crucial step forward, it initially applied only to federal elections. The subsequent Voting Rights Act of 1965 further strengthened voting rights by giving the U.S. Attorney General the authority to challenge poll taxes in state and local elections, ultimately leading to the Supreme Court's ruling in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966), which declared poll taxes unconstitutional in state elections as well.\n\nIn summary, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment addressed voting rights by abolishing the poll tax, thereby removing a significant barrier that had been used to suppress the votes of economically disadvantaged citizens. Its passage represented a major victory in the ongoing struggle for civil rights and equality in the United States.
