    CuriosityStream has become associated with the American Revolution primarily through its documentary offerings that explore this pivotal period in history. One notable series is "Liberty! The American Revolution," a six-hour documentary that delves into the events leading up to the Revolutionary War and its aftermath, starting from 1763 and concluding with the ratification of the United States Constitution. This series provides a comprehensive view of the era, featuring dramatic readings from letters and diaries, as well as insights from historians and actors.\n\nAdditionally, CuriosityStream hosts other relevant content, such as "Women of the American Revolution: The Remarkable Stories You've Never Heard," which highlights the often-overlooked contributions of women during the Revolution.
