    How did the steel plow contribute to the westward expansion of agriculture?
answer: >-
    The steel plow, invented by John Deere in 1837, significantly contributed to the westward expansion of agriculture in the United States by enhancing farming efficiency and productivity. As settlers moved westward, they encountered challenging prairie lands that were difficult to cultivate with traditional wooden or iron plows. The steel plow's sharper edge and greater durability allowed farmers to break through tough, sticky soils much more effectively than its predecessors.\n\nThis innovation enabled farmers to cultivate larger plots of land more quickly, which was crucial for establishing agricultural communities in the newly settled territories. The increased efficiency of the steel plow meant that farmers could access previously unmanageable areas of land, leading to the expansion of farmland and the ability to produce greater yields. As a result, the steel plow played a vital role in transforming subsistence agriculture into a more commercialized and productive system, allowing farmers to specialize in certain crops and improve their incomes.\n\nBy the early 1860s, John Deere was manufacturing over ten thousand plows annually, reflecting the high demand for this revolutionary tool. The steel plow not only facilitated the cultivation of larger fields but also contributed to the emergence of a more affluent class of landowners, thereby reshaping the American agricultural economy and society.\n\nIn summary, the steel plow was instrumental in the westward expansion of agriculture by increasing the efficiency of farming practices, enabling the cultivation of larger areas of land, and ultimately supporting the growth of agricultural production in the United States.
