answer: >-
    The advancement of women's rights in Ireland has been marked by several significant milestones throughout history, particularly from the late 19th century to the present day. Here are some key events and developments:\n\n1. **Founding of Women's Suffrage Organizations**: The women's movement in Ireland gained momentum in the late 19th century. Anna Haslam founded the Dublin Women's Suffrage Association (DSWA) in 1876, which was pivotal in advocating for women's rights, including the right to vote and greater participation in public affairs. This organization followed the establishment of the Irish Women's Suffrage Society by Isabella Tod in 1872.\n\n2. **Political Representation**: In 1919, Constance Markievicz became the first woman elected to the House of Commons in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, representing a significant breakthrough in women's political representation.\n\n3. **Post-War Feminism**: After World War II, feminist organizations re-emerged, leading to the second wave of the women's movement around 1970. This period focused on various issues, including married women's property rights, education, and the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts.\n\n4. **Establishment of the Council for the Status of Women**: In 1973, the Council for the Status of Women was established, marking a formal recognition of women's issues at a governmental level and contributing to the ongoing dialogue about gender equality.\n\n5. **Presidency of Mary Robinson**: In 1990, Mary Robinson was elected as the first female President of Ireland, followed by Mary McAleese in 1997. This was notable as it marked the first time in the world that two women were consecutively elected as heads of state, symbolizing a significant shift in the political landscape for women in Ireland.\n\n6. **Continued Advocacy and Reforms**: The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw ongoing debates and reforms regarding women's rights, particularly concerning reproductive rights and gender equality. The Irish Women's Liberation Movement played a crucial role in advocating for these changes.\n\n7. **Recent Developments**: The discussion around women's rights remains active, particularly in the context of abortion reform and broader socio-economic challenges faced by women in contemporary Ireland.\n\nThese milestones reflect the evolving landscape of women's rights in Ireland, showcasing both the struggles and achievements that have shaped the legal and social position of women in Irish society. The feminist movement has been instrumental in advocating for these changes, leading to significant advancements in gender equality over the years.
