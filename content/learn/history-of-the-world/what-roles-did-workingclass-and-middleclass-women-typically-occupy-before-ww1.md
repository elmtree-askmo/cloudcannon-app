    What roles did working-class and middle-class women typically occupy before WW1?
answer: >-
    Before World War I, the roles of working-class and middle-class women varied significantly based on their social class and economic circumstances.\n\n### Working-Class Women\nWorking-class women typically occupied roles that were labor-intensive and often poorly paid. Their employment was essential for the survival of their families, and they engaged in various forms of work, including:\n\n- **Domestic Servants**: Many working-class women worked as maids or housekeepers in wealthier households, performing tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and childcare.\n- **Factory Workers**: With the rise of industrialization, many women found employment in factories, particularly in textiles and garment manufacturing. These jobs often involved long hours in harsh conditions for low wages.\n- **Street Vendors and Peddlers**: Some women sold goods in marketplaces or went door-to-door selling food and other merchandise, which allowed them to work flexibly while managing household responsibilities.\n- **Laundresses**: Many working-class women operated laundries or worked as laundresses in wealthier homes, providing essential services to families who could afford to pay for laundry.\n\n### Middle-Class Women\nMiddle-class women, on the other hand, were more likely to be confined to domestic roles due to societal expectations and norms. Their typical occupations included:\n\n- **Shopkeepers and Innkeepers**: Some middle-class women managed family businesses, such as shops or inns, often working alongside their husbands or family members.\n- **Textile Workers**: While less common than for working-class women, some middle-class women worked in the textile industry, though they were often in supervisory or administrative roles rather than manual labor.\n- **Educators and Nurses**: As education became more accessible, some middle-class women pursued careers as teachers or nurses, which were considered acceptable professions for women at the time.\n- **Social Reformers**: Many middle-class women were involved in social reform movements, advocating for issues such as child labor laws, women's suffrage, and improved working conditions.\n\n### Social Dynamics\nThe roles of women were heavily influenced by the prevailing patriarchal culture, which often limited their economic independence. While some women, particularly widows, could act as independent economic agents, married women typically required their husbands' approval to engage in work outside the home. This dynamic created a dual burden for many women, who were expected to contribute economically while also fulfilling traditional domestic responsibilities.\n\nIn summary, working-class women were primarily engaged in labor-intensive jobs that supported their families, while middle-class women were often confined to domestic roles or engaged in socially acceptable professions. The industrial era highlighted the complexities and contradictions of women's roles, as they navigated both economic opportunities and societal expectations.
