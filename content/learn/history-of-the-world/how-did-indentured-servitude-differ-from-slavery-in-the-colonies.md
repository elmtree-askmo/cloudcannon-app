    How did indentured servitude differ from slavery in the colonies?
answer: >-
    Indentured servitude and slavery were both forms of labor utilized in the American colonies, but they differed significantly in several key aspects.\n\n1. **Voluntary vs. Involuntary**: Indentured servants were individuals who voluntarily entered into a contract, known as an indenture, to work for a specific period of time—typically ranging from four to seven years—in exchange for passage to America, room and board, and sometimes land or money upon completion of their service. In contrast, slaves were forcibly taken from their homelands and subjected to a lifetime of labor without any hope of freedom.\n\n2. **Duration of Service**: The term of service for indentured servants was predetermined and finite, meaning that they could eventually earn their freedom and were expected to receive training and tools to help them integrate into society as free individuals. Slavery, however, was a lifelong condition, and the status of being a slave was typically inherited, meaning that the children of slaves were also born into slavery.\n\n3. **Social and Legal Status**: Indentured servitude was not based on race or ethnicity, and individuals from various backgrounds could become indentured servants. In contrast, slavery in the colonies became increasingly racialized, with laws codifying the status of African slaves and their descendants as property rather than persons with rights.\n\n4. **Economic Transition**: Until around 1700, indentured servitude was the predominant system of labor in the colonies, with indentured servants making up more than half of European migration to North America. However, as the demand for labor grew, particularly in the Deep South, slavery became more economically expedient and began to replace indentured servitude as the primary labor system.\n\nIn summary, while both indentured servitude and slavery involved unfree labor, they differed fundamentally in terms of consent, duration, social status, and economic implications. Indentured servitude was a temporary arrangement with the possibility of freedom, whereas slavery was a permanent and hereditary condition.
