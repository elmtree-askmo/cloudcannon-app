    What was the significance of Griswold v CT in the context of substantive due process?
answer: >-
    The significance of *Griswold v. Connecticut*, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), in the context of substantive due process lies in its establishment of a constitutional right to privacy, particularly concerning marital relations and the use of contraceptives. The case arose from a challenge to the Connecticut Comstock Act, which prohibited the use of contraceptives and the provision of information about them.\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court found that the Connecticut law violated the right to marital privacy, which is implied by several amendments in the Constitution, including the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments. The Court's majority opinion, delivered by Justice William O. Douglas, emphasized that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects certain fundamental rights from government interference, thereby embracing the concept of substantive due process.\n\nThe decision marked a pivotal moment in American constitutional law, as it recognized that the government could not intrude upon the private decisions of married couples regarding contraception. This case laid the groundwork for future rulings related to privacy rights, including *Roe v. Wade* (1973), which further expanded the interpretation of substantive due process to include a woman's right to choose to have an abortion.\n\nOverall, *Griswold v. Connecticut* is significant not only for its immediate impact on reproductive rights but also for its broader implications regarding the protection of personal liberties against governmental encroachment, reinforcing the notion that certain rights are fundamental and deserving of protection under the Constitution.
