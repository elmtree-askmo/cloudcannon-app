answer: >-
    Visual arts play a significant role in understanding visual perception, particularly within the context of education and cognitive development. According to the gathered information, visual arts originate from visual perception and utilize various properties of vision, ranging from simple geometric arrangements to complex shapes that convey perceptual meanings. This interplay between visual arts and perception is crucial for developing observational skills, especially in young learners.\n\nIn primary education, visual perception and observational skills are essential components of visual arts education. These skills enable students to create artworks and engage in creative projects, fostering a deeper understanding of how to observe and portray subject matter. The research referenced highlights the importance of Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which suggests that knowledge is actively constructed through experiences, including those in visual arts.\n\nMoreover, visual arts engage with the ambiguities and conventions of perception, allowing artists and viewers to explore how visual stimuli can be interpreted in multiple ways. This exploration enhances the viewer's ability to sense, interpret, and assign meaning to artworks, which is a fundamental aspect of art perception. The cognitive processes involved in creating and experiencing art are complex and involve a shared neural substrate that supports learning and creativity across various domains.\n\nIn summary, visual arts not only reflect the principles of visual perception but also serve as a vital educational tool that enhances observational skills, cognitive development, and the ability to interpret visual stimuli, thereby enriching the overall understanding of visual perception.
