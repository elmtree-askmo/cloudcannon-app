    In Spanish, the word for 'reading' is "leyendo," which is the gerund form of the verb "leer." The noun form is "la lectura," which refers to the act of reading or the material being read.\n\nWhen discussing academic terms related to reading, several key vocabulary words can be useful:\n\n1. **Leer** - to read (verb)\n2. **La lectura** - reading (noun)\n3. **Interpretación** - interpretation (noun), which can refer to the analysis of texts.\n4. **Estudiar** - to study (verb), often used in academic contexts.\n5. **Repasar** - to review (verb), commonly used when going over material.\n6. **Echarle un vistazo a** - to take a look at (informal expression).\n7. **Darle una hojeada a** - to glance at (informal expression).\n\nAdditionally, expanding your vocabulary in an academic setting can include terms such as:\n\n- **Investigación** - research\n- **Hipótesis** - hypothesis\n- **Ciencias** - sciences\n- **Matemáticas** - mathematics\n- **Historia** - history\n- **Arte** - art\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with these terms can enhance your communication skills in a Spanish-speaking academic environment, making it easier to engage in discussions and understand course materials.
