    What are the stages of degree progression, and what are the research requirements for each?
answer: >-
    Degree progression typically involves three main stages: undergraduate (BA), graduate (MA), and doctoral (PhD) programs. Each stage has distinct research requirements and expectations.\n\n1. **Undergraduate Degree (BA)**:\n   - **Research Requirements**: At this level, students are generally expected to engage in introductory research activities. This may include writing research papers, conducting literature reviews, and participating in group projects. The focus is on developing foundational skills in research methodology and critical thinking.\n   - **Specialization**: Students begin to explore specific areas of interest within their field, but the research is often guided and less independent.\n\n2. **Graduate Degree (MA)**:\n   - **Research Requirements**: Graduate programs typically require students to complete a significant amount of coursework (e.g., 20 units, with at least 10 at the graduate level) and to undertake a research project or thesis. This research should be original and may involve fieldwork or in-depth analysis of existing literature. For example, an MA thesis in Folklore would require students to conduct original research and present their findings.\n   - **Specialization**: Students deepen their expertise in a specific area, often choosing electives that align with their research interests. They are expected to engage more critically with existing research and contribute new insights.\n\n3. **Doctoral Degree (PhD)**:\n   - **Research Requirements**: PhD candidates must conduct extensive original research that contributes new knowledge to their field. This typically culminates in a dissertation, which is a substantial piece of work based on independent research. The dissertation process involves formulating a research question, conducting a literature review, and employing rigorous research methodologies.\n   - **Specialization**: At this stage, students are expected to become experts in their chosen area of study, often contributing to academic discourse through publications and presentations at conferences.\n\nUnderstanding these stages of degree progression helps students set academic and career goals, as each level builds upon the previous one, increasing in complexity and depth of research.
