    What are the criteria for granting classical language status in India?
answer: >-
    In India, the criteria for granting classical language status were established by the Ministry of Culture in 2004. A language must meet the following key criteria to be designated as classical:\n\n1. **High Antiquity**: The language must have a recorded history of over a thousand years, with ancient texts that span between 1500 to 2000 years.\n\n2. **Ancient Literature**: There must be a significant body of ancient literature that is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers. This literature should include knowledge texts beyond just poetry, reflecting the language's cultural significance.\n\n3. **Distinct Heritage**: The language should possess a distinct heritage that sets it apart from other languages.\n\nThese criteria were first applied when Tamil was recognized as a classical language in 2004, followed by Sanskrit in 2005, and several others including Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, and Odia in subsequent years. Recently, the Union Cabinet has also granted classical language status to five additional languages: Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Pali, and Prakrit, thereby increasing the total number of recognized classical languages in India to eleven.\n\nThis recognition not only honors the historical and cultural significance of these languages but also promotes scholarly research, preservation, and revitalization of ancient texts and knowledge systems, which are essential to India's intellectual and cultural identity.
