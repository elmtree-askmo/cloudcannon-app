    What are the major assignments in the course and their weightage?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the major assignments in the course typically include a combination of series tests and assignments, with specific weightage assigned to each. For example, the weightage for series tests is often set at 50%, while assignments may contribute around 10% to the final grade. \n\nWhile the exact details of the assignments and their weightage can vary by course, it is common for the total weightage of all assignments to add up to 100%. This means that each assignment's contribution to the final grade is calculated based on its specific percentage. \n\nFor instance, if there are two major assignments, one might be weighted at 10% and the other at 20%, contributing to a total of 30% towards the final grade. The remaining weight would typically be allocated to other assessments, such as exams or projects.\n\nTo summarize, the major assignments in the course generally include:\n- Series tests: 50%\n- Assignments: 10%\n- Other assessments: 40% (this could include projects, presentations, etc.)\n\nIt is essential to refer to the course syllabus for precise details on the assignments and their respective weightage, as these can vary significantly between different courses.
