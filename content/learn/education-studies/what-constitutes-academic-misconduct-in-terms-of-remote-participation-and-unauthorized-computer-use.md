    What constitutes academic misconduct in terms of remote participation and unauthorized computer use?
answer: >-
    Academic misconduct in the context of remote participation and unauthorized computer use encompasses several specific actions that violate the integrity of the academic process. Based on the gathered information, the following points outline what constitutes academic misconduct in this scenario:\n\n1. **Remote Completion**: Engaging in assessments remotely is explicitly prohibited. Any attempt to complete the quiz or test from a location outside the designated environment is considered academic misconduct.\n\n2. **Unauthorized Computer Use**: Students are instructed that their computers should only be used for writing the test. Any other use of the computer during the assessment, such as accessing the internet, using unauthorized software, or communicating with others, is deemed a violation of academic integrity.\n\n3. **Prohibited Aids**: The use of outside aids, including notes, textbooks, or electronic devices (like phones), is not allowed. Students must ensure that their phones are turned off and that they are not using any unauthorized materials during the assessment.\n\n4. **Identification and Monitoring**: Students are required to present identification and adhere to the rules set forth for the assessment. Failure to comply with these rules can also be considered a form of academic misconduct.\n\nThe emphasis on academic integrity is crucial, as it ensures that all students are assessed fairly and that the value of their qualifications is maintained. Violations of these rules can lead to serious consequences, including disciplinary action from the institution. \n\nIn summary, academic misconduct in this context includes remote completion of assessments, unauthorized use of computers for anything other than writing the test, and the use of prohibited aids. Students are encouraged to adhere strictly to these guidelines to maintain the integrity of their academic work.
