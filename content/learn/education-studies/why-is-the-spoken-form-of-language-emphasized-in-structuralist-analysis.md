    The spoken form of language is emphasized in structuralist analysis for its concrete nature, alignment with language as a closed system, and its empirical accessibility, allowing for deeper insights into the underlying structures of language proposed by Saussure.

    Why is the spoken form of language emphasized in structuralist analysis?
answer: >-
    The spoken form of language is emphasized in structuralist analysis for several key reasons:\n\n1. **Focus on Concrete Forms**: Structuralists prioritize the phonological, morphological, and syntactic aspects of language over semantics. They argue that these elements are more concrete, tangible, and accessible than meanings, which can be abstract and context-dependent. By focusing on the spoken form, structuralists can analyze the systematic relationships between sounds and structures without the complications introduced by written language.\n\n2. **Language as a Closed System**: Structuralism views language as a closed system of forms, where meaning is derived from the relationships between these forms rather than from their external context. The spoken form is seen as a more direct representation of this system, allowing for a clearer analysis of the underlying structures that govern language.\n\n3. **Empirical Basis**: The structuralist approach is rooted in empiricism, which emphasizes observation and experience. Spoken language is more readily observable in natural communication than written language, making it a more suitable subject for empirical study. This aligns with the behaviorist view of language acquisition, which focuses on observable behaviors and responses rather than internal cognitive processes.\n\n4. **Saussure's Dichotomy**: Ferdinand de Saussure, a foundational figure in structuralism, introduced the distinction between "langue" (the abstract system of language) and "parole" (the actual use of language in speech). Structuralists argue that understanding the underlying structure of language (langue) is best achieved through the analysis of spoken language (parole), as it reflects the rules and patterns of the language system.\n\n5. **Mechanistic View of Language Acquisition**: Structuralists often view language acquisition as a mechanical process, where learners internalize the forms of language through repetition and practice. The spoken form is central to this process, as it is the primary mode of communication and interaction in everyday life.\n\nIn summary, the emphasis on the spoken form in structuralist analysis stems from its concrete nature, its alignment with the closed system view of language, its empirical accessibility, and its foundational role in understanding the structures of language as proposed by Saussure. This focus allows structuralists to analyze language systematically and derive insights into its underlying rules and patterns.
