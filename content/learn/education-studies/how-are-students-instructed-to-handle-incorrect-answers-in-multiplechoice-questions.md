    How are students instructed to handle incorrect answers in multiple-choice questions?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Ministry of Education Fiji Year 12 Chemistry Examination 2023, students are instructed to handle incorrect answers in multiple-choice questions by following specific guidelines. According to the examination instructions, students should:\n\n1. Circle the letter of the answer they believe is correct in the Answer Booklet.\n2. If they decide to change their answer, they should put a line through their first choice and then circle the letter of their new choice. This allows for clarity in their final answer selection.\n3. If they change their mind again, they can repeat the process of crossing out the previous answer and circling the new one.\n\nAdditionally, students are encouraged to eliminate all possible wrong answers before making their final selection, which can help improve their chances of choosing the correct answer. It is also advised that students do not spend too much time on any single question, allowing them to manage their time effectively throughout the examination.\n\nThese instructions aim to ensure that students can clearly indicate their answers and make changes if necessary, thereby maximizing their performance on the examination.
