    How are adjectives classified in Latin?
answer: >-
    In Latin, adjectives are classified based on their declension patterns, which correspond to the declensions of nouns. There are two primary groups of adjectives:\n\n1. **First and Second Declension Adjectives**: These adjectives are often referred to as "2-1-2 adjectives" because they have different endings for masculine, feminine, and neuter forms. For example, the adjective "novus" (new) has the forms: \n   - Masculine: novus\n   - Feminine: nova\n   - Neuter: novum\n\n2. **Third Declension Adjectives**: These adjectives can be further classified into three categories based on their terminations:\n   - **Adjectives of Three Terminations**: These have distinct forms for each gender in the nominative singular, such as "ācer, ācris, ācre" (sharp).\n   - **Adjectives of Two Terminations**: These have the same form for masculine and feminine, differing only in the neuter form, such as "levis" (light) for masculine and feminine, and "leve" for neuter.\n   - **Adjectives of One Termination**: These have the same form for all three genders, such as "atrōx" (fierce).\n\nIn Latin, adjectives must agree with the nouns they modify in case, number, and gender. This means that a feminine nominative singular noun must be modified by the feminine nominative singular form of the adjective, while a masculine nominative singular noun is modified by a masculine nominative singular adjective.\n\nUnderstanding the classification of adjectives is crucial for mastering Latin inflection rules, as it helps in correctly modifying nouns and forming grammatically accurate sentences.
