    How does the norm of reaction illustrate the effect of temperature on phenotype?
answer: >-
    The norm of reaction is a crucial concept in genetics that illustrates how environmental factors, such as temperature, can influence the expression of phenotypes from a given genotype. It represents the range of phenotypic outcomes that can arise from a single genotype when exposed to varying environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, consider the case of the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, where the phenotype of eye color or the number of facets in the eye can change depending on the temperature during development. As the temperature increases, the number of facets may decrease, demonstrating how a single genotype can lead to different phenotypic expressions based on environmental conditions. This phenomenon highlights the interaction between genetics and the environment, emphasizing that the same genetic makeup can result in different traits under different environmental influences.\n\nAdditionally, the norm of reaction can be observed in plants, where growth characteristics such as height can vary significantly based on the amount of sunlight and water available, even if the genetic potential for height is identical across different plants. This illustrates that environmental factors play a significant role in shaping the phenotype, reinforcing the idea that genetics alone does not determine an organism's traits.\n\nIn summary, the norm of reaction effectively illustrates the impact of temperature and other environmental factors on phenotype by showing the variability in phenotypic expression that can occur from a single genotype under different environmental conditions.
