    How do current admissions practices affect students from lesser resourced schools?
answer: >-
    Current admissions practices significantly affect students from lesser-resourced schools in various ways, often exacerbating existing inequalities in higher education. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Financial Barriers**: Many high-achieving, low-income students are discouraged from applying to colleges due to the perceived costs associated with tuition, fees, and living expenses. A survey indicated that about 34% of these students chose not to apply to certain institutions, including prestigious ones like New York University and Duke University, primarily because of financial concerns. This highlights how financial barriers can limit access to higher education for students from underfunded schools.\n\n2. **Underfunded Schools**: Schools with smaller budgets often struggle to provide adequate resources, leading to lower student achievement. This lack of funding creates a socioeconomic divide in education, where students from wealthier backgrounds have access to better educational opportunities, including advanced placement courses and college counseling. Consequently, students from lesser-resourced schools may not receive the same level of preparation for college admissions.\n\n3. **Disparities in College Enrollment**: Research shows that low-income, Black, and Hispanic students are underrepresented in higher education, particularly at selective institutions. For instance, while 82% of national high school graduates enroll in college, only 51% of students from high-poverty high schools do the same. This gap underscores the barriers faced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, limiting their opportunities for social mobility and economic advancement.\n\n4. **Recruitment Practices**: Some selective colleges engage in recruitment practices that can be discriminatory, effectively creating a form of "recruitment redlining." This can disadvantage students from lower-income backgrounds, as these institutions may prioritize out-of-state students who can pay higher tuition fees, further marginalizing local, under-resourced students.\n\n5. **Support Systems**: The lack of support during the college application process is another challenge. Many students from lesser-resourced schools apply to college without guidance, with nearly one in four high-achieving, low-income students navigating the process entirely on their own. Programs that connect prospective applicants with mentors from similar backgrounds, like those at Amherst College, can help bridge this gap, but such initiatives are not universally available.\n\n6. **Impact of Affirmative Action**: Research indicates that affirmative action policies can positively impact enrollment for minority and low-income students at selective institutions. These policies help create a more inclusive campus environment, which is crucial for addressing the disparities in college admissions.\n\nIn summary, current admissions practices often disadvantage students from lesser-resourced schools through financial barriers, inadequate preparation, discriminatory recruitment practices, and a lack of support. Addressing these issues is essential for promoting equitable access to higher education and ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed.
