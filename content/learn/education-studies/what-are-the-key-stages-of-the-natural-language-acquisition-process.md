    What are the key stages of the natural language acquisition process?
answer: >-
    The natural language acquisition process is a complex journey that unfolds in several distinct stages, each characterized by unique developmental milestones. Based on the gathered information, the key stages of natural language acquisition can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Babbling Stage**: This is the initial stage of language acquisition, occurring from around 4 to 6 months until about 12 months of age. During this stage, infants produce repetitive consonant-vowel combinations, imitating the sounds they hear from their environment and caregivers.\n\n2. **Echolalia Stage**: In this stage, children begin to repeat phrases or sentences they have heard, often without understanding their meaning. This can include delayed echolalia, where they recall and use chunks of language from previous conversations or media.\n\n3. **Holophrastic Stage**: Also known as the single-word stage, this stage occurs when children start using single words to convey whole ideas or sentences. For example, saying "milk" to mean "I want milk."\n\n4. **Telegraphic Stage**: Typically occurring between 24 to 30 months of age, children begin to form two-word phrases that resemble telegrams, focusing on essential content words while omitting less critical words. For instance, saying "want cookie" instead of "I want a cookie."\n\n5. **Self-Generated Language Stage**: In this final stage, children move beyond using memorized phrases and begin to create their own sentences. They start to combine words more freely and use grammar rules, leading to more complex and varied speech.\n\nThese stages illustrate the progression from simple sound production to the ability to generate spontaneous, meaningful language. Understanding these stages is crucial for educators and parents, as it provides insights into how children learn to communicate effectively.
