    Can you describe the holistic and recursive process of revision used by experienced writers?
answer: >-
    The holistic and recursive process of revision used by experienced writers is characterized by several key features that distinguish it from the more linear approaches often adopted by novice writers. \n\n1. **Ongoing Process**: Experienced writers view revision as a continuous and integral part of the writing process rather than a separate stage that occurs after completing a draft. They engage in revising throughout the writing process, allowing for a dynamic interplay between drafting and revising.\n\n2. **Multitasking on Multiple Levels**: During a single read-through of their text, experienced writers often multitask across various levels of revision. This means they may simultaneously address issues of content, structure, clarity, and style, rather than focusing on one aspect at a time. This recursive approach allows them to refine their ideas and arguments in relation to their overall writing goals.\n\n3. **Critical Analysis**: Revision involves a critical analysis of the text, which includes assessing the effectiveness of arguments, considering counterarguments, and adapting the work to better meet the needs of the audience. This rhetorical analysis is essential for improving the overall effectiveness of the writing.\n\n4. **Holistic Perspective**: Skilled writers distinguish between revising and editing, seeing revision as a holistic process aimed at reshaping their texts. They focus on how changes in one part of the text can affect the whole, ensuring that revisions align with their intended message and purpose.\n\n5. **Feedback Incorporation**: Experienced writers often solicit feedback from peers or mentors as part of their revision process. This external input can provide new perspectives and insights that enhance the quality of their writing.\n\n6. **Recursive Shaping of Thought**: The act of revising is seen as a way to shape thought through language. As writers revise, they rethink and refine their ideas, which can lead to new insights and a deeper understanding of their subject matter.\n\nIn summary, the holistic and recursive revision process employed by experienced writers is marked by its integrative nature, critical engagement with the text, and a focus on continuous improvement throughout the writing journey. This approach not only enhances the quality of the writing but also fosters a deeper connection between the writer and their ideas.
