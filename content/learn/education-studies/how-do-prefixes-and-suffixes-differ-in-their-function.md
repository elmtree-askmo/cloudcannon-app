    How do prefixes and suffixes differ in their function?
answer: >-
    Prefixes and suffixes are both types of affixes that modify the meanings and functions of base words, but they differ significantly in their placement and roles within the structure of a word.\n\n1. **Position**: The most fundamental difference is their position relative to the base word. Prefixes are added to the **beginning** of a word, while suffixes are added to the **end**. This fixed position helps in identifying whether an affix is a prefix or a suffix.\n\n2. **Function**: \n   - **Prefixes** primarily change the meaning of the base word. For example, the prefix "un-" in "undo" negates the action of the verb "do." Other common prefixes include "dis-" (as in "disagree") and "anti-" (as in "antibiotic").\n   - **Suffixes**, on the other hand, often change the grammatical function of the word. They can alter the part of speech, such as turning a noun into a verb or an adjective into a noun. For instance, adding the suffix "-ize" to the noun "memory" creates the verb "memorize." Suffixes can also indicate tense, plurality, or other grammatical aspects, such as "-ed" in "walked" or "-s" in "cats."\n\n3. **Impact on Spelling**: Suffixes can affect the spelling of the base word, while prefixes typically do not. For example, when adding the suffix "-ing" to "run," the word becomes "running," which involves a change in spelling. In contrast, adding a prefix like "re-" to "write" results in "rewrite" without altering the base word's spelling.\n\n4. **Types**: Suffixes can be further categorized into inflectional and derivational suffixes. Inflectional suffixes modify a word's tense, number, or case without changing its core meaning (e.g., "-ing" in "running"), while derivational suffixes create new words and often change the part of speech (e.g., "-ness" in "happiness").\n\nIn summary, prefixes and suffixes serve distinct functions in word formation: prefixes modify meaning, while suffixes can change grammatical function and often affect spelling. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective morphemic analysis and word formation in the English language.
