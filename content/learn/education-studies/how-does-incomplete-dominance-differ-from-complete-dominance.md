    How does incomplete dominance differ from complete dominance?
answer: >-
    Incomplete dominance and complete dominance are two different patterns of inheritance that describe how alleles interact to determine phenotypes in offspring.\n\n1. **Complete Dominance**: In this pattern, the dominant allele completely masks the effect of the recessive allele in heterozygous conditions. This means that if an organism has at least one dominant allele, the phenotype will reflect the dominant trait. For example, if a plant with a dominant allele for red flowers (R) is crossed with a plant with a recessive allele for white flowers (r), all offspring (Rr) will exhibit red flowers, as the dominant allele completely masks the recessive one.\n\n2. **Incomplete Dominance**: In contrast, incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele is completely dominant over the other. Instead, the phenotypes of the two parent alleles blend together to create a new phenotype in the offspring. For instance, if a red flower (RR) is crossed with a white flower (rr), the resulting offspring (Rr) will have pink flowers, which is an intermediate phenotype that does not resemble either parent.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Phenotypic Expression**: In complete dominance, the phenotype of heterozygotes (Rr) is identical to that of the dominant homozygotes (RR). In incomplete dominance, the phenotype of heterozygotes (Rr) is intermediate between the two homozygotes (RR and rr).\n- **Genotypic Ratios**: Incomplete dominance typically results in a phenotypic ratio of 1:2:1 in the F2 generation when crossing two heterozygotes, while complete dominance usually results in a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes.\n\n### Examples:\n- **Complete Dominance**: A classic example is the inheritance of flower color in pea plants, where purple flowers (dominant) completely mask the presence of white flowers (recessive).\n- **Incomplete Dominance**: An example is seen in the four o'clock flower, where crossing red and white flowers results in pink flowers.\n\nIn summary, the main distinction lies in how the alleles interact to produce phenotypes: complete dominance results in one phenotype being expressed, while incomplete dominance results in a blending of traits.
