    How does schema theory explain the influence of prior knowledge on learning?
answer: >-
    Schema theory provides a framework for understanding how prior knowledge influences learning by positing that individuals organize their knowledge into mental structures known as schemas. These schemas serve as cognitive frameworks that help individuals interpret and make sense of new information based on what they already know.\n\nWhen learners encounter new information, they do not process it in isolation; instead, they relate it to their existing schemas. For instance, if a child has a schema for 'dog' that includes characteristics such as 'four legs' and 'barks,' when they encounter a new animal, they can use this schema to understand and categorize the new information. This process of relating new information to prior knowledge is crucial for comprehension and retention.\n\nIn educational settings, activating prior knowledge is essential for effective learning. Teachers can facilitate this by prompting students to recall what they already know about a topic before introducing new concepts. For example, if a teacher is about to teach a lesson on 'ecosystems,' they might first ask students to share their knowledge about 'plants' and 'animals.' This activation of existing schemas helps students create a mental framework that makes it easier to integrate and understand the new information.\n\nMoreover, schema theory emphasizes that prior knowledge can also lead to misunderstandings if the new information contradicts existing schemas. In such cases, educators need to help students modify their schemas to accommodate the new information, which may involve clarifying misconceptions and providing additional explanations.\n\nIn summary, schema theory illustrates that prior knowledge significantly influences learning by providing a context for new information, facilitating comprehension, and guiding the integration of new concepts into existing cognitive structures. This understanding underscores the importance of activating prior knowledge in educational practices to enhance learning outcomes.
