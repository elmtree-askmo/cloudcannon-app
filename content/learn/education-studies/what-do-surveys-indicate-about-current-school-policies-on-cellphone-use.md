    What do surveys indicate about current school policies on cellphone use?
answer: >-
    Surveys indicate that current school policies on cellphone use are increasingly restrictive, reflecting growing concerns among educators and parents about the impact of cellphone use on students' academic performance and social development. A significant study conducted by Tandon et al. (2020) found that 96% of schools restrict cellphone use, with 78% prohibiting it during class time. Additionally, over 90% of principals support restrictions on cellphone use in middle and high schools, and more than 80% believe that cellphone use negatively affects social development and academic outcomes.\n\nAccording to a survey by the EdWeek Research Center, 42% of teachers and principals reported that students are not allowed to use their cellphones at all during the school day, although they can bring them to campus. This trend is echoed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which found that 76% of public schools prohibit non-academic use of cellphones during school hours.\n\nRecent legislative actions in various states, such as Florida, Indiana, and California, have also mandated schools to develop and implement policies that limit cellphone use during school hours. These policies aim to address concerns about disruptions to learning and the potential for bullying, while also promoting digital literacy and responsible technology use among students.\n\nOverall, the data suggests a clear trend towards more stringent cellphone policies in schools, driven by a desire to enhance the educational environment and support student well-being.
