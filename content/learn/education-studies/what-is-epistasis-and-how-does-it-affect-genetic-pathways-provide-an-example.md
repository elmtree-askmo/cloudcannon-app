    Epistasis is a gene interaction where one gene suppresses or masks another, affecting genetic pathways and phenotypic outcomes. An example is the coat color of Labrador retrievers, where the E gene masks the effect of the B gene, altering expected inheritance patterns.

    What is epistasis, and how does it affect genetic pathways? Provide an example.
answer: >-
    Epistasis is a form of gene interaction in which the expression of one gene is suppressed or masked by another gene. This interaction can significantly affect genetic pathways and the phenotypic expression of traits. In essence, epistasis can alter the expected ratios of phenotypes in offspring, complicating the inheritance patterns predicted by Mendelian genetics.\n\nFor example, consider the coat color of Labrador retrievers, which is a classic case of epistasis. There are two genes involved in determining the coat color:\n\n1. The **B gene** (B for black, b for brown) determines the color of the fur.\n2. The **E gene** (E for pigment deposition, e for no pigment) controls whether the pigment is deposited in the fur.\n\nIn this scenario, if a Labrador retriever has the genotype **ee** (homozygous recessive for the E gene), it will have a yellow coat regardless of whether it carries the B or b alleles. This means that the E gene is epistatic to the B gene; the presence of the recessive e allele masks the expression of the B gene, leading to a yellow coat. Thus, the expected phenotypic ratios based on the B gene alone are altered by the presence of the E gene.\n\nThis example illustrates how epistasis can influence genetic pathways by modifying the expression of traits, leading to unexpected phenotypic outcomes in a population.
