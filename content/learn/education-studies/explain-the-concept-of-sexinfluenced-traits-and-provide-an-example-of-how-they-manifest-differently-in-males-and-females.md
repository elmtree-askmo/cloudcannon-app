    Sex-influenced traits are genetic traits expressed differently in males and females, often modulated by hormones. An example is male-pattern baldness, where the trait is dominant in males and recessive in females.

    Explain the concept of sex-influenced traits and provide an example of how they manifest differently in males and females.
answer: >-
    Sex-influenced traits are genetic traits that are expressed differently in males and females, despite both sexes carrying the same alleles. The expression of these traits is often modulated by hormonal differences between the sexes. This means that the same genotype can lead to different phenotypes depending on the sex of the individual.\n\n### Example of Sex-Influenced Traits\nA classic example of a sex-influenced trait is the pattern of baldness in humans. The allele responsible for male-pattern baldness is dominant in males but recessive in females. This means that:\n\n- **Males**: If a male inherits the allele for baldness (even if it is heterozygous), he is likely to express the trait and experience hair loss.\n- **Females**: A female would need to inherit two copies of the baldness allele (homozygous) to express the trait, making it less common for females to exhibit baldness compared to males.\n\n### Comparison with Sex-Limited Traits\nIt is important to differentiate sex-influenced traits from sex-limited traits. While sex-influenced traits can be expressed in both sexes but to different extents, sex-limited traits are expressed exclusively in one sex. For instance, milk production in dairy cattle is a sex-limited trait; only females can produce milk, regardless of the alleles they carry.\n\nIn summary, sex-influenced traits highlight the complex interplay between genetics and hormonal influences, leading to different expressions of the same genetic information in males and females. Understanding these traits is crucial for studying inheritance patterns and their implications in various biological contexts.
