    What is the process for enrolling in Lumenus's programs?
answer: >-
    To enroll in Lumenus's programs, the process generally involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Express Interest**: Families interested in specific programs, such as the Autism Fee for Service program, should first express their interest. This can be done by contacting the Service Program Coordinator.\n\n2. **Contact Information**: For the Autism Fee for Service program, you can reach out via phone at 416-744-7650, ext. 4262, or by email at autism.intake@lumenus.ca. General inquiries can also be directed to info@lumenus.ca.\n\n3. **Eligibility Determination**: After expressing interest, families can expect to go through a process to determine program eligibility. This may involve discussions about the specific needs of the child or family.\n\n4. **Registration and Payment**: Once eligibility is confirmed, families will need to complete registration forms, sign contracts, and process payment. It is important to note that some programs may allow the use of OAP funding for behavior therapy services.\n\n5. **Program Availability**: Keep in mind that a minimum number of participants is required for each program to run. If the minimum enrollment is not met, Lumenus will make efforts to accommodate the child in another program.\n\n6. **Additional Information**: For more details about various programs, including EarlyON Child & Family Centres and other services, families can visit Lumenus's website at www.lumenus.ca.\n\nBy following these steps, families can successfully enroll in the programs offered by Lumenus Community Services.
