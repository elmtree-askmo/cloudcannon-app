    Polygenic inheritance is a genetic mechanism where multiple genes influence a single trait, contrasting with Mendelian inheritance, which usually involves one gene. This results in continuous phenotypic variation, influenced by both genetics and environmental factors.

    What is polygenic inheritance and how does it differ from Mendelian inheritance?
answer: >-
    Polygenic inheritance is a mode of genetic inheritance where a single phenotypic trait is influenced by the cumulative effects of multiple genes, known as polygenes. This form of inheritance contrasts with Mendelian inheritance, which typically involves traits determined by a single gene or a pair of alleles (dominant and recessive). \n\nIn polygenic inheritance, the traits are not simply categorized into discrete phenotypes but rather exhibit continuous variation. For example, traits such as human height, skin color, and eye color are polygenic, as they are influenced by several genes, each contributing a small effect to the overall phenotype. This results in a bell-shaped distribution of phenotypes within a population, where most individuals display intermediate traits, while fewer individuals exhibit extreme traits.\n\nAdditionally, polygenic traits can be influenced by environmental factors, further complicating their expression. This interaction between multiple genes and environmental influences leads to a wide range of possible phenotypes, making polygenic inheritance a non-Mendelian form of inheritance. \n\nIn summary, the key differences between polygenic inheritance and Mendelian inheritance are:\n\n1. **Number of Genes Involved**: Polygenic inheritance involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait, while Mendelian inheritance typically involves one gene.\n2. **Phenotypic Variation**: Polygenic traits show continuous variation, whereas Mendelian traits are often discrete (e.g., dominant or recessive).\n3. **Environmental Influence**: Polygenic traits can be significantly affected by environmental factors, whereas Mendelian traits are primarily determined by genetic factors alone.\n\nOverall, polygenic inheritance illustrates the complexity of genetic traits and the interplay between genetics and the environment in shaping phenotypes.
