    What content is typically covered in a makeup midterm?
answer: >-
    The content typically covered in a makeup midterm exam can vary depending on the instructor's policies and the specific circumstances surrounding the original exam. However, there are some common practices and guidelines that are generally followed:\n\n1. **Timing and Arrangement**: Students are usually required to initiate arrangements for a makeup exam within a week of the excused absence. The makeup exam is typically scheduled to occur within two weeks from the time the arrangements are made.\n\n2. **Content Coverage**: In many cases, the makeup midterm will cover the same material as the original midterm. However, some instructors may choose to include additional content that was not covered in the original exam, which can lead to variations in the questions asked.\n\n3. **Format**: The format of the makeup exam is at the discretion of the instructor. This means that the makeup exam could be in a different format (e.g., multiple choice, essay, etc.) compared to the original midterm.\n\n4. **Policies on Makeup Exams**: Instructors may have specific policies regarding makeup exams, including whether they allow them only for emergencies or if they provide designated days for makeup exams at the end of the semester.\n\n5. **Student Accommodations**: For students requiring accommodations, makeup exams may be scheduled outside of regular class times to provide flexibility. Instructors may also communicate available options for scheduling and acceptable reasons for requesting a makeup exam.\n\nOverall, students should consult their course syllabus or speak directly with their instructor to understand the specific policies and expectations regarding makeup midterms in their courses.
