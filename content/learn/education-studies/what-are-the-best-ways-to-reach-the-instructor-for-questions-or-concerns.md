    What are the best ways to reach the instructor for questions or concerns?
answer: >-
    To reach the instructor for questions or concerns regarding the knitting course, there are several effective methods you can utilize:\n\n1. **In-Lesson Questions**: You can ask questions directly during each lesson. This allows for immediate clarification and engagement with the instructor.\n\n2. **Email Communication**: If you have specific inquiries or need to discuss something in detail, sending an email is a reliable option. Make sure to provide clear details about your question or concern to facilitate a prompt response. For example, if your instructor is Paola Trombetta, you can reach her at ptrombetta@pausd.org.\n\n3. **Course Portal**: If your course utilizes an online education portal (like Canvas), you can communicate through that platform. This method often allows for organized discussions and easy access to course materials.\n\n4. **Proactive Engagement**: Itâ€™s advisable to reach out as soon as you encounter a challenge or have a concern. The earlier you communicate, the more time you and the instructor will have to address the issue effectively.\n\n5. **Preferred Communication Method**: Each instructor may have a preferred method of communication, whether it be email, the course portal, or even in-person meetings. Make sure to use the method they recommend for the quickest response.\n\n6. **Be Patient**: After reaching out, allow some time for the instructor to respond, as they may have other commitments.\n\nBy utilizing these methods, you can effectively communicate with your instructor and ensure that your questions or concerns are addressed in a timely manner.
