answer: >-
    The Salon of the Refused (Salon des Refusés) and the Salon of Independents (Salon des Indépendants) were pivotal exhibitions in the evolution of modern art, reflecting the tensions between traditional academic standards and the emerging avant-garde movements of the 19th century.\n\n### Salon of the Refused\n\nThe Salon des Refusés was established in 1863 in response to the overwhelming rejection of artworks submitted to the official Paris Salon, which was the premier art exhibition of the time. The official Salon's jury rejected approximately two-thirds of the submissions that year, including notable works by artists such as Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, and Camille Pissarro. In light of protests from the artists, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the creation of the Salon des Refusés to showcase these rejected works.\n\nThe purpose of the Salon des Refusés was to provide a platform for artists whose works did not conform to the traditional standards upheld by the official Salon. This exhibition marked a significant turning point in art history, as it introduced the public to new styles and ideas that would later be associated with Impressionism and the broader avant-garde movement. The exposure to these unconventional works encouraged artistic experimentation and shifted public perception regarding what constituted acceptable art.\n\n### Salon of Independents\n\nFollowing the momentum of the Salon des Refusés, the Salon des Indépendants was founded in 1884 by a group of artists, including Georges Seurat, as a direct challenge to the rigid and exclusionary practices of the official Salon. Unlike the Salon des Refusés, which focused on rejected works, the Salon des Indépendants allowed any artist to exhibit their work without a selection committee, provided they paid a fee. This open-access model fostered a diverse range of artistic expressions and became a crucial venue for avant-garde art.\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants played a significant role in the development of modern art movements, including Impressionism and Expressionism. It provided a space for innovative and unconventional artworks, allowing artists to explore new techniques and themes without the constraints of academic standards. The exhibition became known for showcasing works that challenged traditional aesthetics and embraced modernity, thus influencing the trajectory of 19th-century art history.\n\n### Influence on Modern Art\n\nBoth the Salon des Refusés and the Salon des Indépendants were instrumental in the evolution of artistic practices during a time of significant social and cultural change. They not only provided alternative platforms for artists but also encouraged a broader dialogue about the nature of art and its role in society. The exposure to new styles and ideas at these exhibitions helped to democratize art, making it more accessible to the public and paving the way for future movements that would continue to challenge established norms.\n\nIn summary, the Salon of the Refused and the Salon of Independents were crucial in shaping modern art by promoting artistic freedom, encouraging experimentation, and fostering a more inclusive art community. Their legacy continues to resonate in contemporary art practices and exhibitions today.
