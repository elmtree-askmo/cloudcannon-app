    What is the current structure of the education system in Ontario?
answer: >-
    The current structure of the education system in Ontario is organized into three main stages: early childhood education, elementary education, and secondary education. \n\n1. **Early Childhood Education**: This stage caters to children from birth to age 6, providing foundational learning experiences.\n\n2. **Elementary Education**: Public elementary schools in Ontario serve students from Junior Kindergarten through to Grade 8. Children can enroll in full-day kindergarten starting at the age of four. Typically, students complete elementary school around the age of 13.\n\n3. **Secondary Education**: This stage includes grades 9 to 12, where students generally graduate at around 17 or 18 years of age.\n\nThe education system is administered by various school boards, which are categorized as follows:\n- 31 English Public school boards\n- 29 English Catholic school boards\n- 4 French Public school boards\n- 8 French Catholic school boards\n\nThe Ministry of Education oversees the entire system, developing education policy, managing the provincial curriculum, and allocating funds to the school boards. The education system is primarily funded by the Government of Ontario, with education being a provincial responsibility, meaning there is no federal involvement in policy formation or analysis.\n\nIn recent years, the government has emphasized a "back-to-basics" approach, focusing on improving student achievement in core subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics. This reflects a broader commitment to ensuring that Ontario's education system remains high-quality and competitive.\n\nOverall, the structure is designed to provide a comprehensive educational experience from early childhood through to the end of secondary school, preparing students for further education or the workforce.
