    What is the role of dissonance in the revision process?
answer: >-
    The role of dissonance in the revision process is significant, as identified by Nancy Sommers over forty years ago. Dissonance refers to the incongruities that writers experience between their intentions and the actual execution of their writing. This recognition of dissonance is considered a core competency of revision.\n\nFor student writers, dissonance often presents a challenge, as they may struggle to reconcile their original ideas with the outcomes of their writing. However, for advanced student writers, dissonance can take on different forms. These writers may embrace theories of revision but find it difficult to implement the associated practices effectively. This struggle can lead to internalized fear-based narratives that negatively impact their writing process.\n\nThrough in-process reflection, students can navigate this dissonance by adapting or "rescripting" their fears into productive elements of writing and revision. This process highlights the emotional work involved in revision and suggests that pedagogies for advanced writers should address these emotional aspects to facilitate a more effective revision process.\n\nIn summary, dissonance plays a crucial role in prompting writers to reflect on their work, recognize areas for improvement, and ultimately enhance their writing through a more engaged and thoughtful revision process.
