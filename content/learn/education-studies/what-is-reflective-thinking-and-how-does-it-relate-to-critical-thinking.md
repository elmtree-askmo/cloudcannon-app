    What is reflective thinking and how does it relate to critical thinking?
answer: >-
    Reflective thinking and critical thinking are closely related cognitive processes that enhance problem-solving and decision-making abilities. \n\nReflective thinking involves the process of introspection, where individuals analyze their emotions, experiences, reactions, and knowledge. It is about creating connections between these elements to gain deeper insights into one's thoughts and actions. This type of thinking encourages individuals to "take a step back" and evaluate their own viewpoints, which can lead to personal growth and a better understanding of complex situations.\n\nOn the other hand, critical thinking is characterized by a more structured and systematic approach to analyzing information. It involves organizing thoughts in a rational manner and understanding the logical connections between ideas or facts. Critical thinking is often referred to as "directed thinking" because it focuses on achieving specific outcomes, such as forming opinions or making decisions based on evidence.\n\nWhile reflective thinking can be seen as a component of the broader critical thinking process, it specifically emphasizes the evaluation of past experiences and judgments. By integrating both reflective and critical thinking, individuals can enhance their cognitive skills, leading to more effective problem-solving and decision-making in various contexts.\n\nIn summary, reflective thinking allows for personal insight and understanding, while critical thinking provides a framework for analyzing information and making informed decisions. Together, they form a comprehensive approach to thinking that is essential for learning and adapting to new challenges.
