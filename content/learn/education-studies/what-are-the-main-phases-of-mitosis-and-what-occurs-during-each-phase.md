    What are the main phases of mitosis and what occurs during each phase?
answer: >-
    Mitosis is a critical process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The main phases of mitosis are as follows:\n\n1. **Prophase**: \n   - Chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope.\n   - The nuclear envelope begins to break down, allowing the spindle fibers to access the chromosomes.\n   - Spindle fibers, which are essential for chromosome movement, start to form from the centrosomes.\n\n2. **Metaphase**: \n   - Chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane, also known as the metaphase plate.\n   - Each chromosome is attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles of the cell, ensuring that they will be evenly divided.\n\n3. **Anaphase**: \n   - The sister chromatids are pulled apart at the centromere and move toward opposite poles of the cell.\n   - This separation ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes.\n\n4. **Telophase**: \n   - The separated chromatids reach the opposite poles and begin to de-condense back into chromatin.\n   - The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, resulting in two distinct nuclei within the cell.\n\n5. **Cytokinesis**: \n   - This process occurs concurrently with telophase and involves the division of the cytoplasm.\n   - In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms, pinching the cell into two separate daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms to divide the cell.\n\nThe overall process of mitosis is essential for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms. The formula for the number of cells after mitosis can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nN = 2^n\n$$\n\nwhere $ N $ is the number of cells and $ n $ is the number of divisions.
