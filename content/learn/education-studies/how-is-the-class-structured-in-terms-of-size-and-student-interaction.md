    How is the class structured in terms of size and student interaction?
answer: >-
    The structure of a class in higher education can significantly influence student interaction and engagement. Class sizes can vary widely across institutions, with some considering classes of 25-35 students as small, while others may define large classes as those containing between 60 and 149 students. The size of the class can impact how students interact with each other and their overall learning outcomes.\n\nEmpirical studies indicate that larger class sizes may lead to lower levels of student engagement and satisfaction. For instance, research has shown that in larger classes, students may have fewer opportunities for meaningful interactions with peers and instructors, which can negatively affect their perceived learning outcomes. Conversely, smaller classes tend to foster better interaction among students and between students and instructors, potentially enhancing academic and social engagement.\n\nThe relationship between class size and student performance is complex and somewhat inconclusive. While some studies suggest that smaller classes positively impact academic performance, others indicate that class size has limited or no effect on performance. Factors such as attentiveness, involvement, class participation, and the perceived supportiveness of the teacher also play crucial roles in determining student outcomes, regardless of class size.\n\nIn summary, the structure of a class in terms of size can significantly affect student interaction and engagement, with smaller classes generally promoting better interaction and satisfaction among students. However, the impact of class size on academic performance remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.
