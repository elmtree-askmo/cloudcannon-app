    What are the common formatting guidelines for APA style citations?
answer: >-
    The common formatting guidelines for APA style citations, as outlined in the seventh edition of the APA Publication Manual, include the following key elements:\n\n### General Format for Papers\n1. **Margins**: 1-inch margins on all sides.\n2. **Font**: Use a readable font, such as 12-point Times New Roman, 11-point Arial, or 11-point Calibri.\n3. **Line Spacing**: Double-space all text, including the reference list.\n4. **Page Numbers**: Include page numbers in the top right corner of each page.\n5. **Title Page**: The title page should include the title of the paper, the author's name, and the institutional affiliation, centered and double-spaced.\n\n### In-Text Citations\n- **Format**: Use the author-date citation system. For example:\n  - Paraphrase: (Author, Year)\n  - Direct quote: (Author, Year, p. Page Number)\n- **Multiple Authors**: For works with two authors, include both names (Author1 & Author2, Year). For three or more authors, use the first author's name followed by "et al." (Author et al., Year).\n\n### Reference List\n- **Title**: The reference list should be titled "References" and centered at the top of the page.\n- **Hanging Indent**: Each reference entry should have a hanging indent (the first line is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented).\n- **Order**: List references in alphabetical order by the surname of the first author.\n- **Basic Format for Common Sources**:\n  - **Books**: \n    ```\n    Author, A. A. (Year). Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle. Publisher.\n    ```\n  - **Journal Articles**: \n    ```\n    Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. Title of Journal, volume number(issue number), page range. https://doi.org/xxxx\n    ```\n  - **Webpages**: \n    ```\n    Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of webpage. Website Name. URL\n    ```\n\n### Additional Guidelines\n- **DOI and URLs**: Include a DOI for journal articles when available. For online sources, provide the full URL.\n- **Capitalize**: Only the first word of the title and subtitle, as well as proper nouns, should be capitalized in the title of works.\n\nThese guidelines help ensure clarity and consistency in academic writing, making it easier for readers to locate and verify sources. For more detailed information, you can refer to the APA Formatting and Style Guide available on the Purdue OWL website.
