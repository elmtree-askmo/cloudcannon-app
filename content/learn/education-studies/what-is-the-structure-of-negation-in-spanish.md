    What is the structure of negation in Spanish?
answer: >-
    In Spanish, the structure of negation primarily involves the use of the adverb "no," which is placed before the verb to negate the action. This is the most straightforward way to form a negative sentence. For example, in the sentence "Él no quiere comer" (He does not want to eat), "no" is positioned directly before the verb "quiere."\n\nAdditionally, Spanish allows for the use of other negative words to enhance negation. Common negative words include "nada" (nothing), "nadie" (nobody), and "ningún" (none). These words can be used in conjunction with "no" to create more complex negative sentences. For instance, "Nadie ha visto nada" translates to "Nobody has seen anything," where both "nadie" and "nada" contribute to the negation.\n\nIt's also important to note that Spanish often employs double negatives, which are grammatically correct and commonly used. For example, "No tengo nada" (I have nothing) uses both "no" and "nada" to emphasize the negation. This differs from English, where double negatives are typically avoided.\n\nIn summary, the basic structure of negation in Spanish involves placing "no" before the verb, and it can be expanded with additional negative words for emphasis or clarity. Understanding these structures is essential for effective communication in Spanish.
