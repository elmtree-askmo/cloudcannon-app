    What is the correct format for the title and positioning on an APA reference page?
answer: >-
    In APA format, the reference page is a crucial component of an academic paper, and it must adhere to specific guidelines for proper setup and formatting. Here are the key elements regarding the title and positioning on an APA reference page:\n\n1. **New Page Requirement**: The reference page should start on a new page at the end of the document. This ensures that it is clearly separated from the main content of the paper.\n\n2. **Title Formatting**: The title of the reference page should be "References." This title must be centered and bolded at the top of the page. It is important to use the exact wording and formatting as specified.\n\n3. **Spacing**: All entries on the reference page should be double-spaced. This includes the space between the title and the first entry, as well as between each reference entry.\n\n4. **Hanging Indent**: Each reference entry requires a hanging indent. This means that the first line of each reference should be flush left, while subsequent lines of the same entry should be indented by 0.5 inches. This formatting helps to visually distinguish between different references.\n\n5. **Alphabetical Order**: The entries should be listed in alphabetical order by the last name of the first author of each work. If a work has no author, it should be alphabetized by the title.\n\n6. **Margins and Font**: The entire document, including the reference page, should have 1-inch margins on all sides, and a standard font such as 12-point Times New Roman is typically used.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you ensure that your reference page is correctly formatted according to APA style, which is essential for academic writing and helps readers locate the sources you have cited in your work.
