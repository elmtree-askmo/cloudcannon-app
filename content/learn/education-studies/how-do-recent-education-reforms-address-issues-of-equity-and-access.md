    How do recent education reforms address issues of equity and access?
answer: >-
    Recent education reforms in the United States, particularly under the Biden-Harris Administration, have focused significantly on addressing issues of equity and access in education. The U.S. Department of Education has implemented a comprehensive 2023 equity action plan aimed at advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities. This plan is part of a broader agenda titled "Raise the Bar: Lead the World," which emphasizes several key areas:\n\n1. **Accelerating Learning**: The reforms prioritize accelerating learning in schools, particularly for students who have been historically marginalized. This includes ensuring that all students have access to a comprehensive and well-rounded education.\n\n2. **Mental Health Support**: Recognizing the mental health crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the reforms aim to strengthen supports for students' mental health and wellbeing. This includes increasing the skills and knowledge of school personnel to better support students' mental health needs and expanding the supply of mental health professionals in schools.\n\n3. **Multilingual Learning**: The reforms also focus on expanding access to multilingual learning opportunities, which is crucial for students from diverse linguistic backgrounds.\n\n4. **Community Support**: The administration has significantly increased funding for Full-Service Community Schools, which provide additional resources to underserved schools. This funding has grown from $30 million in Fiscal Year 2021 to $150 million in Fiscal Year 2024, allowing schools to offer services such as healthcare, housing, and childcare to help close resource and opportunity gaps.\n\n5. **Equity in Funding**: The reforms include measures to ensure that school districts with the highest poverty levels do not experience per-pupil funding decreases below pre-pandemic levels. This is part of the guidance released under the American Rescue Plan, which aims to protect funding for the most vulnerable districts.\n\n6. **Evidence-Based Practices**: The Department of Education is holding an Educational Equity Summit Series to identify evidence-based practices and promising strategies to address disparities in education. This initiative encourages states, schools, and communities to invest in resources provided by the American Rescue Plan and other federal proposals to support underserved students.\n\n7. **Addressing Disparities**: The reforms also respond to the disparate impacts of the pandemic on K-12 and postsecondary students in underserved communities, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to support these populations.\n\nOverall, these recent education reforms reflect a concerted effort to tackle longstanding disparities in education, ensuring that all students, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, have equitable access to quality education and support services.
