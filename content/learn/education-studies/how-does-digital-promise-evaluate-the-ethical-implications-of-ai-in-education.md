    How does Digital Promise evaluate the ethical implications of AI in education?
answer: >-
    Digital Promise evaluates the ethical implications of AI in education through a comprehensive framework that emphasizes co-designing AI tools with key stakeholders, including education leaders, teachers, and students. Their recent report, “An Ethical and Equitable Vision of AI in Education: Learning Across 28 Exploratory Projects,” highlights the importance of ensuring that AI resources are relevant, ethical, and equitable. This approach is grounded in the belief that educators and students must be central to the development of AI tools to ensure these technologies effectively meet their needs.\n\nDigital Promise also focuses on AI safety by developing Responsible Use Policies and an educator version of an AI Bill of Rights. They participate in initiatives like the EdSAFE AI Alliance and work on product certifications to promote ethical practices in AI design and implementation. Furthermore, they engage communities that will be most affected by AI in education, ensuring that their voices are included in the design, evaluation, and adoption processes.\n\nThe organization recognizes the need for comprehensive support and ongoing professional learning for educators to effectively integrate AI tools in classrooms. By fostering AI literacy and digital equity, Digital Promise aims to create a future where AI enhances educational experiences while addressing potential ethical concerns related to its use in K-12 education. This includes addressing gaps in access, design, and use of AI technologies to ensure that all learners benefit equitably from these advancements.
