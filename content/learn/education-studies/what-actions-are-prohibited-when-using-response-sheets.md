    What actions are prohibited when using response sheets?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, there are no specific details regarding prohibited actions when using response sheets in an exam context. However, I can provide general guidelines that are typically applicable in educational settings regarding the use of response sheets:\n\n1. **No Unauthorized Materials**: Students should not use unauthorized materials or resources while completing response sheets. This includes textbooks, notes, or electronic devices unless explicitly allowed by the instructor.\n\n2. **No Plagiarism**: Students must ensure that their responses are original and not copied from other students or sources. Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity.\n\n3. **No Communication with Peers**: During the completion of response sheets, students should not communicate with each other. This includes sharing answers or discussing the exam content.\n\n4. **No Tampering with Response Sheets**: Students should not alter or tamper with response sheets after submission. This includes making changes to answers or attempting to erase and rewrite responses.\n\n5. **Adherence to Instructions**: Students must follow all specific instructions provided by the instructor regarding the completion and submission of response sheets. This includes formatting, timing, and any other guidelines.\n\n6. **No Disruptive Behavior**: Students should maintain a quiet and respectful environment while completing response sheets, avoiding any behavior that could distract others.\n\nIf you have specific guidelines or rules from your institution regarding response sheets, it is advisable to refer to those for the most accurate information. If you need further clarification or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
