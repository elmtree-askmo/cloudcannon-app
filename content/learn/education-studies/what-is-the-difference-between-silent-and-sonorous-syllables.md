    What is the difference between silent and sonorous syllables?
answer: >-
    The difference between silent and sonorous syllables lies primarily in their pronunciation and the presence of sound at the end of the syllable.\n\n1. **Syllabes sonores (Sonorous syllables)**: A sonorous syllable is one that ends with a pronounced sound. For example, in the word "chat," the syllable "chat" is sonorous because it is fully pronounced and contributes to the clarity of the word's pronunciation. Sonorous syllables are essential for effective communication, as they help convey meaning clearly.\n\n2. **Syllabes muettes (Silent syllables)**: In contrast, a silent syllable is one that ends with a sound that is not pronounced. This typically occurs with syllables that end in an 'e' that is not vocalized, such as in the word "chante," where the syllable "te" is considered silent. Silent syllables play a significant role in the prosody and rhythm of the language, even though they do not contribute to the phonetic output of the word.\n\nIn summary, sonorous syllables are pronounced and contribute to the sound of a word, while silent syllables are not pronounced and do not contribute to the audible output, affecting the overall rhythm and flow of speech.
