    How do predicted grades compare to actual student performance?
answer: >-
    Predicted grades are often used in educational systems, particularly in the context of university applications, to forecast a student's future academic performance based on their past achievements. However, research indicates that there is a significant discrepancy between predicted grades and actual student performance.\n\nA study analyzing data from university applicants between 2013 and 2015 found that only 16% of predicted grades were accurate. This means that a vast majority, approximately 75%, of applicants had their grades over-predicted. Other studies, such as those conducted by Delap (1994) and Everett and Papageourgiou (2011), revealed that around half of all predictions were accurate, but 42-44% were over-predicted by at least one grade. Furthermore, only 7-11% of predictions were under-predicted.\n\nThe challenges in accurately predicting grades stem from various factors, including the inherent difficulties teachers face in assessing students' potential and the influence of socio-economic status (SES) on performance. Research suggests that low SES students often perform better than predicted, highlighting the complexities involved in the prediction process.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest that while predicted grades play a crucial role in the university admissions process, they are often unreliable indicators of actual student performance, with a tendency towards over-prediction. This discrepancy has important implications for educational policy and the university admissions system, as it can affect students' opportunities and choices.
