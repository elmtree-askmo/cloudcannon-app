    How will translation and cases be assessed in the exam?
answer: >-
    In the Latin exam, translation and cases will be assessed primarily through the translation of an unseen passage. The assessment criteria focus on three main capacities:\n\n1. **Understanding and Conveying Meaning**: Students must demonstrate the ability to accurately and appropriately understand and convey the meaning of the passage they are translating.\n\n2. **Interpreting Grammatical Aspects**: Students are expected to interpret and express the grammatical aspects of the passage accurately. This includes understanding the roles of different Latin cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.) and how they function within the context of the sentences.\n\n3. **Fluency in English Expression**: Finally, the translation must be expressed in fluent English, ensuring that the final output is coherent and reflects the original Latin text's meaning and structure.\n\nThese criteria are consistent across multiple years of Latin exams, indicating a stable framework for evaluating translation skills. The assessment will likely include specific attention to how well students understand and apply Latin cases in their translations, as these are fundamental to conveying the correct meaning in Latin.
