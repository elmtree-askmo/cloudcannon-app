    Polygenic traits are influenced by multiple genes, leading to continuous phenotypic variation, while Mendelian traits are governed by a single gene, showing discrete categories. This article explores the differences and complexities of these inheritance patterns.

    What are polygenic traits, and how do they differ from Mendelian traits?
answer: >-
    Polygenic traits are characteristics that are influenced by multiple genes, known as polygenes, rather than a single gene. This mode of inheritance leads to a continuous range of phenotypes, as opposed to the discrete categories typically seen in Mendelian traits. For example, traits such as human height, skin color, and eye color are polygenic, with each contributing gene having a small additive effect on the overall phenotype. This results in a bell-shaped distribution of traits within a population, where most individuals exhibit intermediate traits, while fewer individuals display extreme traits.\n\nIn contrast, Mendelian traits are determined by one gene or a pair of alleles, following the principles established by Gregor Mendel. These traits often exhibit clear dominant and recessive patterns, leading to discrete phenotypic categories (e.g., tall vs. short plants in Mendel's pea experiments).\n\nThe key differences between polygenic inheritance and Mendelian inheritance include:\n\n1. **Number of Genes Involved**: Polygenic inheritance involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait, while Mendelian inheritance typically involves one gene.\n2. **Phenotypic Variation**: Polygenic traits show continuous variation, whereas Mendelian traits are often discrete (e.g., dominant or recessive).\n3. **Environmental Influence**: Polygenic traits can be significantly affected by environmental factors, whereas Mendelian traits are primarily determined by genetic factors alone.\n\nAdditionally, the interaction between multiple genes and environmental influences complicates the expression of polygenic traits, making polygenic inheritance a non-Mendelian form of inheritance. This complexity highlights the intricate nature of genetic inheritance patterns beyond Mendelâ€™s classical laws.
