    Who are the potential successors speculated for the Delhi Chief Minister's position?
answer: >-
    Following Arvind Kejriwal's unexpected resignation as Delhi's Chief Minister, several potential successors have emerged within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The most prominent candidate is Atishi, who is currently serving as the Education Minister and has been recognized for her significant contributions to Delhi's education system. She was proposed by Kejriwal himself during a meeting of party MLAs and has since been unanimously elected as his successor.\n\nOther names speculated as potential successors include Saurabh Bhardwaj and Gopal Rai, both of whom hold important positions within the party. Additionally, there has been some discussion around Sunita Kejriwal, the wife of Arvind Kejriwal, as a possible candidate, although Atishi appears to be the frontrunner.\n\nAtishi's leadership is expected to focus on continuing the initiatives and policies established by Kejriwal, particularly in education and public welfare, as she takes on the role of Chief Minister until the next assembly elections.
