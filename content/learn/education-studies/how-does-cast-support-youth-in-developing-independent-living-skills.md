    How does CAST support youth in developing independent living skills?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) supports youth in developing independent living skills through several targeted programs designed to facilitate their transition to independence. Here are the key components of CAST's support for youth in this area:\n\n1. **Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP)**: This program specifically targets youth aged 16-21 who are transitioning from foster care or group homes to independent living. It provides individualized case management and real-world exposure, helping youth develop essential skills for self-sufficiency.\n\n2. **Life Skills Program**: This program enhances independent living skills while promoting economic and social self-sufficiency. It utilizes the Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA) to evaluate the skills youth need for their well-being, confidence, and safety as they navigate significant life milestones such as high school and employment.\n\n3. **Foundations Semi-Independent Program**: This short-term supportive housing initiative is aimed at youth aged 16-21 involved in the child welfare system. It offers opportunities to gain life-building skills, including budgeting, education, and employment readiness.\n\n4. **Pape Adolescent Resource Centre (PARC)**: Operated by CAST in partnership with other organizations, PARC provides programming and resources to assist youth aged 16-29 in their transition to independent living. This includes access to a Youth in Transition Worker who can guide them through the process.\n\n5. **Individual Support from ILP Case Managers**: ILP Case Managers meet with youth regularly to provide guidance, coaching, and instruction on independent living skills. They also serve as positive role models, helping youth establish healthy relationships.\n\nThrough these programs and services, CAST aims to equip youth with the necessary skills and support to thrive independently, ensuring they have the tools to manage their personal care and daily living effectively.
