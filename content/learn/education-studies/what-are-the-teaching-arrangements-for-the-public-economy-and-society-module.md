    The teaching arrangements for the Public Economy and Society (公經社) module, which is part of the junior secondary curriculum, are designed to foster the holistic development of students aged 12 to 14. The curriculum aims to instill correct values, positive attitudes, and good behavior among students. Here are the key aspects of the teaching arrangements:\n\n1. **Curriculum Framework**: The Public Economy and Society module is based on the guidelines set forth by the Curriculum Development Council in 2022. It emphasizes the integration of civic education, economic understanding, and social awareness.\n\n2. **Core Objectives**: The primary goal of the curriculum is to cultivate students' understanding of citizenship, economics, and societal issues. This includes fostering a sense of national identity and understanding the principles of public policy and economics.\n\n3. **Content Focus**: The curriculum includes topics related to civic responsibility, economic principles, and social structures. It aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how these elements interact within society.\n\n4. **Teaching Strategies**: Educators are encouraged to use a variety of teaching methods, including project-based learning, discussions, and case studies, to engage students actively. This approach helps students apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations.\n\n5. **Integration with Other Subjects**: The Public Economy and Society module is designed to complement other subjects, particularly in social sciences, by providing a broader context for understanding economic and social issues.\n\n6. **Assessment and Evaluation**: The curriculum includes assessments that evaluate students' understanding of the material and their ability to apply concepts in practical scenarios. This may involve both formative and summative assessments.\n\n7. **Resources and Support**: Teachers are provided with various resources, including textbooks and digital materials, to support their teaching. These resources are designed to enhance the learning experience and provide diverse perspectives on the topics covered.\n\nOverall, the Public Economy and Society module aims to prepare students to become informed and responsible citizens who can engage thoughtfully with the economic and social challenges of their time.
