    What are the daily availability and service hours for career services, and how do company visits fit into this schedule?
answer: >-
    The daily availability and service hours for career services are as follows:\n\n- **Monday to Friday**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM\n\nCareer services are available for both walk-ins and by appointment. While appointments can be made for in-person visits or virtual visits via Zoom, it's important to note that staff may not always be available for walk-ins. To check availability, you can use the Navigate app or the lobby kiosk in the Career Services office.\n\nRegarding company visits, these are typically scheduled as part of the career services offerings. Employers can host site visits that last around 1-2 hours, which usually include an employer presentation, an information session, a panel of employees, a company tour, and networking opportunities with professionals. These visits are designed to help students learn about different work environments and career transitions directly from company employees.\n\nIf you are interested in scheduling a company visit, you would need to complete a request form to provide the necessary information for the visit. This process helps coordinate the logistics, including transportation and student invitations.\n\nIn summary, career services operate Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM, and company visits are integrated into this schedule, providing valuable opportunities for students to engage with potential employers.
