    How can parents or guardians prepare their teens for driving?
answer: >-
    Parents and guardians play a crucial role in preparing their teens for driving, as the early stages of driving are particularly perilous. Here are several strategies that can help ensure that teens become safe and confident drivers:\n\n1. **Provide Supervised Driving Practice**: It is essential for parents to offer ample opportunities for supervised driving practice. Research indicates that teens often exit the learner's permit phase with significant skill deficits, which increases their risk of crashing. Experts recommend that teens should accumulate around 50 hours of practice driving, far exceeding the typical six hours provided by school driver's education programs.\n\n2. **Schedule Multiple Practice Sessions**: Consistent practice is key to improving driving skills. Parents should make time to practice with their teens regularly, ideally two hours a week over several months, to help them build the necessary experience and confidence.\n\n3. **Set a Good Example**: Teens learn by observing their parents. Parents should model safe driving behaviors, such as avoiding distractions (like texting or using a phone), obeying traffic laws, and practicing defensive driving techniques. This not only reinforces safe habits but also instills a sense of responsibility in the teen.\n\n4. **Engage in Driver Education Programs**: Parents should seek out driver education programs that meet or exceed the Novice Teen Driver Education and Training Administrative Standards. These programs are designed to teach the rules of the road and help teens develop the skills needed to pass their driving tests.\n\n5. **Monitor Sleep and Driving Conditions**: Drowsy driving is a significant risk factor for teens. Parents should ensure that their teens get adequate sleep and monitor their driving habits, especially during nighttime hours when the risk of accidents increases.\n\n6. **Use Structured Practice Plans**: Many resources, such as the TeenDrivingPlan Practice Guide, provide structured practice plans that parents can use to help their teens develop essential driving skills. These plans often include a variety of driving conditions, such as different weather scenarios and unfamiliar roads.\n\n7. **Encourage Open Communication**: Parents should maintain an open line of communication with their teens about driving experiences, concerns, and challenges. This dialogue can help teens feel more comfortable discussing their fears or uncertainties about driving.\n\n8. **Continued Monitoring and Education**: Even after obtaining a driver's license, parents should continue to monitor their teen's driving habits and provide ongoing education about safe driving practices. This can include discussing the importance of seatbelt use, the dangers of impaired driving, and the need for caution in various driving conditions.\n\nBy actively engaging in their teen's driving education and providing support, parents can significantly reduce the risks associated with teen driving and help their children become safe, responsible drivers.
