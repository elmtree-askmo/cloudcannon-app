    How do formative and summative assessments differ in their approach and objectives?
answer: >-
    Formative and summative assessments are two distinct approaches to evaluating student learning, each with its own objectives and methodologies.\n\n### Formative Assessment\nFormative assessment occurs during the learning process and is designed to provide ongoing feedback to both educators and students. The primary goal of formative assessments is to enhance student learning in real-time. This type of assessment allows instructors to identify areas where students may be struggling and adjust their teaching strategies accordingly. Examples of formative assessments include:\n\n- Quizzes\n- Class discussions\n- Homework assignments\n- Entry/exit slips\n- Concept maps\n\nThese assessments are typically low stakes, meaning they do not significantly impact a student's final grade but are crucial for guiding instructional adjustments and improving student understanding.\n\n### Summative Assessment\nIn contrast, summative assessment is administered at the conclusion of an instructional period to evaluate student learning against established standards or benchmarks. The main objective of summative assessments is to measure the cumulative knowledge and skills that students have acquired over a specific period. Common examples of summative assessments include:\n\n- Final exams\n- Standardized tests\n- End-of-term projects\n- Major presentations\n\nThese assessments are often high stakes, meaning they can significantly affect a student's final grade and are used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of educational programs and student achievement.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Timing**: Formative assessments are conducted throughout the learning process, while summative assessments occur at the end of an instructional unit.\n2. **Purpose**: The purpose of formative assessments is to inform and improve teaching and learning, whereas summative assessments aim to evaluate and measure student learning outcomes.\n3. **Feedback**: Formative assessments provide immediate feedback that can be used to make adjustments in teaching, while summative assessments typically provide feedback after the learning has occurred, often in the form of grades or scores.\n4. **Impact on Grades**: Formative assessments usually have a minimal impact on final grades, while summative assessments can significantly influence a student's overall performance.\n\nIn summary, both formative and summative assessments play essential roles in the educational process, serving different purposes and providing valuable insights into student learning and instructional effectiveness.
