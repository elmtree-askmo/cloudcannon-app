    What types of assistance are available for students during exams with special accommodations?
answer: >-
    Students with disabilities may receive various types of assistance during exams through special accommodations designed to ensure they can fairly demonstrate their knowledge and skills. These accommodations are tailored to the individual needs of the student and can vary based on the academic environment, course objectives, and the nature of the disability. Here are some common types of assistance available:\n\n1. **Extended Time**: Students may be granted additional time to complete their exams, which helps mitigate the impact of their disabilities on their performance.\n\n2. **Quiet Room**: Some students may require a distraction-free environment, which can be provided by allowing them to take exams in a separate, quiet room.\n\n3. **Use of Technology**: Accommodations may include the use of laptops or calculators during exams, depending on the nature of the test and the student's needs.\n\n4. **Alternative Formats**: In some cases, students may be allowed to take exams in alternative formats, such as oral exams instead of written ones, although this is less common in college settings.\n\n5. **Breaks**: Extra and extended breaks during the exam may be provided to help students manage fatigue or stress.\n\n6. **Physical Accommodations**: This can include special furniture requests (like specific desks or chairs), accessible exam locations, or special positioning during the exam (e.g., lying down or elevating a limb).\n\n7. **Assistance from Peers**: Some students may be allowed to receive notes from a peer notetaker, particularly in graduate and professional programs.\n\n8. **Adaptive Technology Training**: Students may also receive training in adaptive technology to assist them during exams.\n\n9. **Learning Support**: Additional support may include help with study skills and time management, mentoring programs, and access to student support groups.\n\nIt is important for students to communicate their needs and ensure that accommodations are in place well before the exam day. They should work with their school's disability services or relevant coordinators to confirm that all necessary arrangements are made.
