    What recent approvals have been made regarding classical language status in India?
answer: >-
    Recently, on October 3, 2024, the Union Cabinet of India approved classical language status for five languages: Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Pali, and Prakrit. This decision was made under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and reflects a significant recognition of the cultural and historical importance of these languages. With this approval, the total number of recognized classical languages in India has now increased to 11.\n\nThe classification of a language as "classical" is based on criteria established by the Government of India, which includes the high antiquity of its early texts and a recorded history of over a thousand years. The recognition of these languages underscores their role as custodians of India's rich cultural heritage, preserving literature, traditions, and history.\n\nThis initiative not only acknowledges the contributions of these languages to India's linguistic diversity but also aims to promote and celebrate regional languages, enhancing the cultural fabric of the nation.
