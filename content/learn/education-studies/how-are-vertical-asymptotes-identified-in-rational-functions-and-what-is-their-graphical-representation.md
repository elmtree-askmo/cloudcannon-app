    How are vertical asymptotes identified in rational functions, and what is their graphical representation?
answer: >-
    Vertical asymptotes in rational functions are identified at the values of $ x $ that make the denominator of the function equal to zero, provided that the numerator does not also equal zero at those points. This is because a rational function is typically expressed in the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\n$$\n\nwhere \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials. When \( Q(x) = 0 \), the function approaches infinity or negative infinity, indicating the presence of a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Steps to Identify Vertical Asymptotes:\n1. **Set the Denominator to Zero**: Solve the equation \( Q(x) = 0 \).\n2. **Check the Numerator**: Ensure that \( P(x) \) does not equal zero at those points. If \( P(x) = 0 \) at the same $ x $ value, it indicates a removable discontinuity rather than a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Graphical Representation:\nGraphically, vertical asymptotes are represented as dashed vertical lines on the graph of the function. As the function approaches the vertical asymptote, the graph will tend to rise or fall steeply towards positive or negative infinity. For example, the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) has a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $. The graph of this function will show that as $ x $ approaches 0 from the left, \( f(x) \) approaches negative infinity, and as $ x $ approaches 0 from the right, \( f(x) \) approaches positive infinity.\n\n### Example:\nFor the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x^2 - 1} \):\n- Set the denominator to zero: $ x^2 - 1 = 0 $ gives $ x = 1 $ and $ x = -1 $.\n- Check the numerator: $ 2x + 1 $ is not zero at $ x = 1 $ or $ x = -1 $.\n\nThus, there are vertical asymptotes at $ x = 1 $ and $ x = -1 $.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUnderstanding vertical asymptotes is crucial for analyzing the behavior of rational functions, as they indicate points where the function is undefined and help in sketching the graph accurately.
