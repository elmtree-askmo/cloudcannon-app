    How is class participation evaluated in the course?
answer: >-
    Class participation in the course is evaluated based on several criteria. It typically includes the overall quality of a student's contributions to class discussions, both in-person and online, such as through bulletin board assignments. Participation may also involve leading discussions and engaging substantively with the material presented in class. \n\nIn some courses, class participation can account for a significant portion of the final grade, often around 25% to 40%. This evaluation may also consider attendance and the student's ability to keep up with course materials, as indicated by quizzes or other assessments. Overall, active and meaningful engagement in class is expected and is a key component of the evaluation process.
