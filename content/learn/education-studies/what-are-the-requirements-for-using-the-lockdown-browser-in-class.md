    To use the Lockdown Browser in class, the following requirements and guidelines must be adhered to:\n\n1. **Bring Your Laptop**: Students are required to bring their laptops to class, as the Lockdown Browser will be utilized for the exam.\n\n2. **Use of Lockdown Browser**: The Lockdown Browser is a specialized web browser that creates a secure testing environment. It restricts access to other applications, websites, or resources during the exam, ensuring that students cannot use unauthorized materials. This includes preventing the opening of new tabs, taking screenshots, or copying and pasting text.\n\n3. **No Open Notes or Paper Notes**: Students are not allowed to bring open notes or paper notes into the classroom. This is to maintain the integrity of the exam environment.\n\n4. **Practice Quiz**: A practice quiz is available on Canvas to help students familiarize themselves with the Lockdown Browser. This practice quiz is essential for ensuring that students can successfully download and use the browser before the actual exam.\n\n5. **Exam Structure**: The exam will consist of 50 questions, each worth two points, totaling 100 points. There will also be an extra credit section that may offer an additional 5 to 8 points, depending on the number of questions included.\n\nBy following these guidelines, students can ensure they are prepared for the exam using the Lockdown Browser effectively.
