    What percentage of the overall grade does the final exam constitute?
answer: >-
    The percentage of the overall grade that the final exam constitutes can vary significantly depending on the specific course and the instructor's grading policy. Common weights for final exams can range from 20% to 70% of the overall grade. For example, one source indicates that a final exam might be worth 40% of the term grade, while another example shows a final exam carrying a weight of 70%.\n\nTo determine the exact percentage for a particular course, students should refer to their course syllabus or consult with their instructor, as this information is typically outlined there. If you are looking to calculate how your final exam score will impact your overall grade, you can use a final grade calculator, which requires your current grade, the desired final grade, and the weight of the final exam.
