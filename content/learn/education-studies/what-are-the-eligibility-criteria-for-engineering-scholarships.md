    What are the eligibility criteria for engineering scholarships?
answer: >-
    The eligibility criteria for engineering scholarships can vary significantly depending on the specific scholarship program. However, some common requirements include:\n\n1. **Academic Status**: Many scholarships require applicants to be full-time students pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in engineering, engineering technology, or computer science.\n\n2. **Membership in Relevant Organizations**: For certain scholarships, such as those offered by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), applicants may need to be paid members of the organization. Membership typically requires a membership number and may involve participation in society activities.\n\n3. **Specific Demographics**: Some scholarships have additional demographic requirements. For example, the Margaret R. Brewster Scholarship is specifically for graduating high school seniors who reside within certain geographic boundaries.\n\n4. **Accreditation**: Applicants may need to enroll in an ABET-accredited engineering program, which ensures that the educational program meets specific quality standards.\n\n5. **Financial Need or Merit**: Scholarships may be awarded based on financial need, academic merit, or a combination of both. Some scholarships may also consider extracurricular involvement or leadership roles in engineering-related activities.\n\n6. **Application Process**: The application process typically involves researching available scholarships, completing an online application, and submitting required documents such as recommendation letters and transcripts. Applicants often indicate their eligibility for specific scholarships during the application process.\n\nIn summary, while the specific criteria can differ, common requirements include being a full-time student in an engineering program, potential membership in relevant organizations, and adherence to any specific demographic or geographic requirements.
