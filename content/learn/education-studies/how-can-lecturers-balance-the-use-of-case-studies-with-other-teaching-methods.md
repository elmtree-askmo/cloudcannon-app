    How can lecturers balance the use of case studies with other teaching methods?
answer: >-
    Lecturers can effectively balance the use of case studies with other teaching methods by integrating various pedagogical strategies that complement each other. Here are some key approaches to achieve this balance:\n\n1. **Careful Selection of Case Studies**: It is crucial for lecturers to choose case studies that are relevant to the course material and appropriate for the students' level. Well-selected cases can enhance understanding and facilitate deeper learning, as they encourage students to apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations (Reis, 2023).\n\n2. **Incorporating Active Learning Techniques**: Lecturers can intersperse case studies with interactive elements such as discussions, group work, and problem-solving activities. This not only keeps students engaged but also allows them to explore different perspectives and solutions (Barkley and Major, 2018). For instance, after presenting a case study, a lecturer might facilitate a discussion or a debate on the issues raised, prompting students to think critically and articulate their viewpoints.\n\n3. **Utilizing Lectures for Context**: While case studies provide practical applications, lectures can be used to introduce theoretical frameworks and key concepts that underpin the case studies. This approach helps students to connect the dots between theory and practice, enhancing their overall understanding (Steinhart & Snell, 1999).\n\n4. **Encouraging Critical Thinking**: Case studies are particularly effective in developing critical thinking skills. Lecturers can guide students through the process of identifying problems, evaluating alternatives, and proposing solutions, which can be complemented by theoretical discussions during lectures (Barnes et al., 1994).\n\n5. **Feedback and Reflection**: After engaging with case studies, lecturers should provide opportunities for feedback and reflection. This can be done through Q&A sessions or reflective writing assignments, allowing students to consolidate their learning and articulate their insights (Ernst & Colthrope, 2007).\n\n6. **Blending Methods**: Rather than viewing case studies and lectures as opposing methods, lecturers can blend them. For example, a lecture could introduce a topic, followed by a case study that illustrates that topic in action. This sequential approach helps reinforce learning and keeps students engaged.\n\nBy thoughtfully integrating case studies with lectures and other active learning strategies, lecturers can create a dynamic and effective learning environment that fosters deeper understanding and critical thinking among students.
