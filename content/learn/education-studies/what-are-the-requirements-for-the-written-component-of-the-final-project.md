answer: >-
    The requirements for the written component of the final project are as follows:\n\n1. **Format**: The written project should be 1-2 pages long, single-spaced, with 1-inch margins. You may use any reasonable font such as Arial or Helvetica, with a font size between 11 and 12.\n\n2. **Content**: The written component should include:\n   - **Introduction**: A brief paragraph providing background information relevant to the project.\n   - Additional sections may be required, but specific details on these sections were not provided in the gathered information.\n\n3. **Weighting**: The written project accounts for 25% to 40% of the final project grade, depending on the specific course guidelines.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that students present their research and findings in a clear and structured manner, which is essential for effective communication of their project outcomes.
