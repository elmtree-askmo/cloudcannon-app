answer: >-
    The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) offers various scholarships, and the eligibility requirements can vary depending on the specific scholarship. Here are the general requirements and the application process for SWE scholarships:\n\n### Membership Requirements\n1. **SWE Membership**: While you do not have to be a member of SWE to be eligible for all scholarships, some specific scholarships do require SWE membership. To be considered a member, you must be a paid member of the society and possess a membership number. Participation in university activities alone does not qualify you as a member.\n\n2. **Full-Time Student Status**: Applicants must be full-time students pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in engineering, engineering technology, or computer science.\n\n### Specific Eligibility Criteria\n- Some scholarships, like the Margaret R. Brewster Scholarship, have additional requirements such as being a graduating high school senior and residing within specific geographic boundaries.\n- Applicants may need to enroll in an ABET-accredited engineering program.\n\n### Application Process\n1. **Research Scholarships**: Begin by researching the various scholarships available through SWE. Each scholarship may have different eligibility criteria and requirements.\n\n2. **Online Application**: The application process is entirely online. You will need to submit your application, along with any required recommendation letters and transcripts, through the SWE scholarship portal.\n\n3. **Indicate Eligibility**: During the application, you will need to indicate which scholarships you are eligible for and applying to. \n\n4. **Single Application**: With one application, you are automatically considered for all scholarships for which you qualify. \n\n5. **Review Timeline**: After submission, SWE will review applications and begin awarding scholarships around May/June. All applicants will receive their scholarship decisions by September.\n\n6. **Additional Materials**: If selected, you may be asked to provide an official transcript and other materials to verify your eligibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while SWE membership is not mandatory for all scholarships, it is beneficial for certain ones. The application process is straightforward and conducted online, allowing applicants to apply for multiple scholarships with a single submission. For more detailed information, it is advisable to visit the official SWE website or the specific scholarship pages.
