    What is the difference between left-hand and right-hand limits in calculus?
answer: >-
    In calculus, the concepts of left-hand limits and right-hand limits are essential for understanding how functions behave as they approach a specific point from different directions.\n\n1. **Left-Hand Limit**: The left-hand limit of a function \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches a value $ a $ is denoted as:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L\n   $$\n   This notation indicates that we are considering the values of \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches $ a $ from the left side (i.e., values less than $ a $). The left-hand limit focuses on the behavior of the function as it gets closer to $ a $ from the left.\n\n2. **Right-Hand Limit**: Conversely, the right-hand limit of a function \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches $ a $ is denoted as:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L\n   $$\n   This notation indicates that we are looking at the values of \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches $ a $ from the right side (i.e., values greater than $ a $). The right-hand limit examines the function's behavior as it approaches $ a $ from the right.\n\n### Significance of Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits\nThe left-hand and right-hand limits are particularly important in the following contexts:\n\n- **Continuity**: A function is continuous at a point $ a $ if both the left-hand limit and right-hand limit exist and are equal to the function's value at that point:\n  $$\n  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)\n  $$\n  This means that for a function to be continuous at $ a $, the limits from both sides must converge to the same value.\n\n- **Discontinuities**: If the left-hand limit and right-hand limit do not match, the function has a discontinuity at that point. This can occur in cases of jump discontinuities or removable discontinuities.\n\n- **Vertical Asymptotes**: In the case of vertical asymptotes, one or both of the one-sided limits may approach infinity as $ x $ approaches $ a $.\n\nUnderstanding these limits helps in analyzing the behavior of functions, especially piecewise functions, and is crucial for further studies in calculus, including derivatives and integrals.
