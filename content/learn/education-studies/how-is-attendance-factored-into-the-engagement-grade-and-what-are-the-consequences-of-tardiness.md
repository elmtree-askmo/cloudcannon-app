    How is attendance factored into the engagement grade, and what are the consequences of tardiness?
answer: >-
    Attendance is a significant factor in determining the engagement grade in many courses. Instructors often assign points for attendance, and this can directly influence the overall grading scale. For instance, in some courses, students may need to attend at least 65% of the sessions to avoid receiving an "F" for the course. This policy underscores the importance of being present, whether in-person or online, as attendance is closely linked to academic performance.\n\nConsequences of tardiness can vary by instructor and course policy, but generally, being late can negatively impact a student's engagement grade. Tardiness may disrupt the learning environment and can be viewed as a lack of commitment to the course. In some cases, repeated tardiness could lead to a reduction in participation points or even affect the overall grade, as consistent attendance and punctuality are often seen as indicators of a student's dedication to their education.\n\nOverall, maintaining good attendance and punctuality is crucial for achieving a favorable engagement grade and ensuring a positive academic experience.
