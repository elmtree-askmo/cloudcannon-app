    What are the key components that distinguish critical reading from simple reading?
answer: >-
    Critical reading is distinguished from simple reading by several key components that emphasize a deeper engagement with the text. Here are the main differences:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The primary goal of simple reading is to gain a basic understanding of the text. In contrast, critical reading aims to form judgments about how the text works, including its arguments, structure, and underlying meanings.\n\n2. **Activity Level**: Simple reading is often a passive process where the reader absorbs information. Critical reading, however, is an active process that involves analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating the text. This means that critical readers engage with the material, questioning and reflecting on what they read.\n\n3. **Focus and Questions**: While simple reading may focus on the surface-level content, critical reading requires readers to focus on the author's purpose, biases, and the context of the text. Critical readers ask probing questions about the text, such as its implications, the validity of its arguments, and the presence of any logical fallacies.\n\n4. **Response**: In simple reading, the response to the text is often limited to summarizing or recalling information. Critical reading encourages readers to engage in a dialogue with the text, responding with their own insights, critiques, and connections to other texts or ideas.\n\n5. **Analytical Skills**: Critical reading develops analytical skills that allow readers to discern essential points from secondary ones, identify biases, and recognize logical fallacies. This level of scrutiny is not typically present in simple reading.\n\n6. **Intertextual Connections**: Critical readers often look for connections between different texts, enhancing their understanding and fostering a more comprehensive view of the subject matter. This intertextual approach is less common in simple reading.\n\nIn summary, critical reading is a more complex and engaged form of reading that involves a thorough analysis of the text, questioning its content and context, and forming informed opinions based on a deeper understanding of the material.
