    What is the expected phenotypic ratio in a dihybrid cross involving two heterozygous parents?
answer: >-
    In a dihybrid cross involving two heterozygous parents (for example, RrYy x RrYy, where R represents round seed shape, r represents wrinkled seed shape, Y represents yellow seed color, and y represents green seed color), the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring is 9:3:3:1. \n\nThis ratio can be interpreted as follows:\n- 9 offspring will exhibit the phenotype of round yellow seeds (R_Y_),\n- 3 offspring will exhibit round green seeds (R_yy),\n- 3 offspring will exhibit wrinkled yellow seeds (rrY_),\n- 1 offspring will exhibit wrinkled green seeds (rryy).\n\nThis outcome arises from the independent assortment of the alleles for the two traits, as described by Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment. The total number of combinations in the offspring is 16, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. \n\nIn summary, the expected phenotypic ratio in a dihybrid cross involving two heterozygous parents is:\n\n$$\n9:3:3:1\n$$
