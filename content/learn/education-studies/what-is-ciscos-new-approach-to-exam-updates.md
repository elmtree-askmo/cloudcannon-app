    What is Cisco's new approach to exam updates?
answer: >-
    Cisco's new approach to exam updates, announced in December 2023, emphasizes a more dynamic and transparent process for its certification programs. This includes significant updates to various certifications, particularly the CCNA and CCNP tracks, to ensure that the content remains relevant to current industry needs and technological advancements.\n\n### Key Aspects of Cisco's New Exam Update Approach:\n\n1. **Regular Updates**: Cisco has committed to reviewing each technology on a quarterly basis to ensure that its exams reflect the latest developments in Cisco technologies. This proactive approach allows for timely updates to the exam content.\n\n2. **Advance Notification**: Cisco plans to announce blueprint changes 3-6 months in advance. This includes revised exam topics and release notes, giving candidates ample time to prepare for the changes.\n\n3. **Dynamic Curriculum**: The CCNA v1.1 exam, which will go live on August 20, 2024, introduces new topics such as Generative AI, Cloud Networking Management, and Machine Learning. This shift aims to align the certification with emerging technologies and market demands.\n\n4. **Certification Roadmaps**: Cisco has enhanced its Certification Roadmaps to provide clarity and transparency regarding exam updates. These roadmaps serve as a guide for candidates to plan their certification journeys effectively and stay informed about upcoming changes.\n\n5. **Resource Availability**: Cisco is working with publishers like Pearson to ensure that updated study materials and Official Cert Guides are available in a timely manner. For instance, Pearson is expected to release new materials for the CCNA in Q3 2023 and for the ENCOR exam in Q4 2023.\n\n6. **Focus on Emerging Technologies**: The updates are designed to ensure that the certification content is relevant and aligns with technology shifts and industry movements. This includes a focus on AI and machine learning, which are becoming increasingly important in networking.\n\n7. **Community Engagement**: Cisco encourages candidates to engage with the Cisco Learning Network Community for support and to stay updated on certification information.\n\nOverall, Cisco's new approach aims to create a more responsive and relevant certification process that meets the evolving needs of the technology landscape and its professionals.
