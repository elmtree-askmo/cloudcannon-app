    How should participial phrases be punctuated at the end of a sentence?
answer: >-
    When punctuating participial phrases at the end of a sentence, the general rule is to place a comma before the phrase if it modifies an earlier word in the sentence. However, if the participial phrase immediately follows the word it modifies, no comma is needed. \n\nFor example:\n- Correct: "The men were warned, working on the electrical lines."\n- Correct: "The men working on the electrical lines were warned."\n\nIt's important to note that many writers often overlook the necessary comma when adding a participial phrase as an afterthought. Therefore, if the participial phrase provides non-essential information, it should be set off with commas. Conversely, if the phrase is essential to the meaning of the sentence, it should not be enclosed in commas.\n\nIn summary, the placement of commas with participial phrases at the end of a sentence depends on whether the phrase is restrictive (essential) or non-restrictive (non-essential) to the meaning of the sentence.
