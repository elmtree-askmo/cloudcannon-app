answer: >-
    Effective strategies for reviewing Latin vocabulary include a variety of engaging methods that cater to different learning styles. Here are some recommended approaches:\n\n1. **Flashcards**: Utilizing flashcards is a simple yet effective method for vocabulary review. By focusing on 10-15 flashcards daily over a period, such as a summer break, students can reinforce their memory of 100-150 vocabulary words by the time school resumes.\n\n2. **Games and Activities**: Incorporating games like Pictionary can make vocabulary review more enjoyable. Students can draw words or phrases, which helps in visualizing and remembering the vocabulary. Additionally, resources like "28 Games and Activities for the Latin Classroom" provide numerous ideas to engage students and reactivate their memory of Latin vocabulary and grammar.\n\n3. **Multiple Practice Opportunities**: Engaging in various review activities is crucial. Research indicates that brief review activities integrated into lesson plans can significantly aid in practicing and retaining vocabulary meanings.\n\n4. **Reading Original Texts**: One of the most effective ways to enhance vocabulary retention is through reading original Latin texts. This not only helps in understanding the context in which words are used but also reinforces grammar and vocabulary in a natural setting.\n\n5. **Use of Technology**: Platforms like Memrise can be beneficial for vocabulary learning. They often include interactive elements that can motivate students and enhance retention.\n\n6. **Targeted Review**: Focus on vocabulary that poses the most difficulty. This targeted approach ensures that students spend time on areas that will yield the greatest improvement.\n\n7. **Video Resources**: Watching educational videos, such as those provided by Latin with Andy, can help reinforce vocabulary through auditory and visual learning.\n\nBy employing a combination of these strategies, students can effectively review and retain Latin vocabulary, ultimately improving their overall language skills and performance in exams.
