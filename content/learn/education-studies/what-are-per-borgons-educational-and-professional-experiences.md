    What are Per Borgon's educational and professional experiences?
answer: >-
    Per Borgen is a notable figure in the tech education space, primarily recognized as the co-founder and CEO of Scrimba, a learning platform that has grown to over 1.5 million users. His educational background includes studying economics at the University of Oslo, after which he transitioned into the field of software development.\n\nBorgen's professional journey began with a failed startup, which led him to attend a peer-to-peer coding boot camp called Founders and Coders in London. This boot camp was unique in that it operated without teachers and emphasized project-based learning, allowing participants to gain hands-on experience in coding.\n\nBefore founding Scrimba, Borgen worked as a frontend developer at Xeneta, where he contributed to the development of customer-facing applications using React.js. He also held a position as a web developer at Founders & Coders C.I.C. and was the co-founder and CEO of Propell AS.\n\nIn addition to his role at Scrimba, Borgen is actively involved in discussions about AI engineering and innovative approaches to coding education, often sharing insights on how AI can enhance the learning experience by making it more engaging and accessible. His work aims to inspire more individuals to learn coding and pursue careers in technology.
