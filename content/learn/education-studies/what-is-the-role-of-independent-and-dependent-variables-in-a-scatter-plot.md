    What is the role of independent and dependent variables in a scatter plot?
answer: >-
    In a scatter plot, the roles of independent and dependent variables are crucial for understanding the relationship between the two continuous variables being analyzed.\n\n1. **Independent Variable**: This is the variable that is manipulated or changed in an experiment. It is plotted on the horizontal axis (X-axis) of the scatter plot. For example, if you are studying the effect of study hours on exam scores, the number of study hours would be the independent variable.\n\n2. **Dependent Variable**: This variable is measured or observed in response to changes in the independent variable. It is plotted on the vertical axis (Y-axis) of the scatter plot. Continuing with the previous example, the exam scores would be the dependent variable, as they depend on the number of study hours.\n\nThe scatter plot visually represents the relationship between these two variables, allowing researchers to assess the strength and direction of the correlation. Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to an observation, with its position determined by the values of the independent and dependent variables. For instance, if a scatter plot shows a positive correlation, it indicates that as the independent variable increases (more study hours), the dependent variable also tends to increase (higher exam scores).\n\nIn summary, the independent variable is what you change, and the dependent variable is what you measure. Properly identifying and plotting these variables is essential for accurately interpreting the data and drawing meaningful conclusions from the scatter plot.
