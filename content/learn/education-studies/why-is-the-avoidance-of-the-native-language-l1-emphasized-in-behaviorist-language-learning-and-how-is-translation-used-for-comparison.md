    Why is the avoidance of the native language (L1) emphasized in behaviorist language learning, and how is translation used for comparison?
answer: >-
    In behaviorist language learning, the avoidance of the native language (L1) is emphasized primarily because behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and the reinforcement of correct responses. The theory posits that language learning is a mechanical process driven by stimulus-response patterns, where learners acquire language through imitation and reinforcement. By minimizing the use of L1, educators aim to encourage learners to engage directly with the target language (L2), thereby reinforcing the correct usage of L2 forms and structures without the interference of L1 habits.\n\nThe rationale behind this approach is that reliance on L1 can lead to the transfer of incorrect habits and structures, which may interfere with the acquisition of L2. As noted in the gathered information, old habits from L1 can impede the learning of new L2 habits, making it crucial to limit L1 use to foster a more effective learning environment. This aligns with the behaviorist view that learning is a result of conditioned responses to stimuli, where the absence of L1 encourages learners to respond to L2 stimuli more effectively.\n\nTranslation, on the other hand, can be used for comparison to highlight differences and similarities between L1 and L2. While behaviorism generally discourages the use of L1, translation can serve as a tool to facilitate understanding of L2 structures and vocabulary. It allows learners to draw parallels between their native language and the target language, which can enhance comprehension and retention. However, the use of translation has been viewed negatively in some contexts, as it can be seen as a crutch that may hinder the development of fluency in L2.\n\nRecent research suggests that translation can play a facilitative role in language learning, especially when used judiciously alongside other activities. It can help learners recognize and understand the nuances of L2, thereby improving their overall language competence. Thus, while behaviorism emphasizes the avoidance of L1 to prevent interference, translation can be strategically employed to aid in the learning process by providing a comparative framework for understanding L2.
