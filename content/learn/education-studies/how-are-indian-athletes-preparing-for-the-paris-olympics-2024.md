    How are Indian athletes preparing for the Paris Olympics 2024?
answer: >-
    Indian athletes are intensively preparing for the Paris Olympics 2024, with significant government support and advancements in sports infrastructure. The Indian government has allocated over â‚¹470 crores to assist athletes across 16 disciplines, including prominent figures like Neeraj Chopra and PV Sindhu. This funding is aimed at enhancing training facilities and providing necessary resources for athletes to excel.\n\nThe preparations have led to a transformative phase in India's sports ecosystem, with various initiatives and programs launched to improve training and infrastructure. For instance, the Indian men's hockey team is focusing on team cohesion and tactical strategies, while athletes like Kushagra Rawat are engaged in endurance workouts and technique improvement to meet qualification standards.\n\nAs the Olympics approach, the majority of the Indian athletics team, including Neeraj Chopra, will undergo their final training phases in European countries such as Turkiye, Poland, and Switzerland. All selected athletes are expected to report any changes in their training status that could affect their performance.\n\nIndia is set to send its largest-ever contingent of 117 athletes, including 48 women, to the Paris Olympics, reflecting a strong commitment to achieving better results than in previous editions. The athletes are scheduled to assemble in Paris shortly before the competitions begin, ensuring they are well-prepared for the challenges ahead.
