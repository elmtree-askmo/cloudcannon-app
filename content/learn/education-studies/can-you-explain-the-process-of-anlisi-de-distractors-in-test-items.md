    The process of Anàlisi de Distractors, or distractor analysis, involves evaluating the effectiveness of incorrect answers in multiple-choice test items. It ensures that distractors are plausible and functioning well to draw test-takers away from the correct answer, thereby enhancing the reliability and validity of assessments.

    The process of "Anàlisi de Distractors," or distractor analysis, is a critical component in the evaluation of multiple-choice test items. This analysis focuses on the performance of incorrect answers (distractors) in relation to the correct answer, ensuring that the test items are functioning as intended. Here’s a detailed overview of the process:\n\n1. **Purpose of Distractor Analysis**: The primary goal is to assess how well the distractors are performing in drawing test-takers away from the correct answer. Effective distractors should be plausible enough to attract examinees who may not know the correct answer, thereby providing valuable insights into the test-takers' understanding of the material.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Distractor Functionality**: The analysis typically involves evaluating the frequency with which each distractor is selected. A well-functioning distractor should be chosen by a significant number of test-takers, indicating that it is a plausible option. If a distractor is rarely selected, it may need to be revised or replaced.\n\n3. **Psychometric Models**: Various item response models can be employed in distractor analysis. Common models include:\n   - **Nominal Response (NR) Model**: This traditional model assesses the selection of distractors without considering the scoring of the item.\n   - **Two-Parameter Logistic Model**: This model combines the scoring of items with the selection of distractors, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of how distractors function in relation to item difficulty and discrimination.\n\n4. **Impact of Distractor Quality**: The quality of distractors directly affects the reliability and validity of the assessment. Poorly designed distractors can lead to misleading conclusions about student performance. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that distractors are not only plausible but also sufficiently attractive to test-takers.\n\n5. **Assessment of Distractor Effectiveness**: The analysis may also include examining the relationship between the number of functioning distractors per item and the overall psychometric characteristics of the test. For instance, reducing the number of options from four to three can impact test scores and reliability, which should be evaluated during the analysis.\n\n6. **Iterative Improvement**: Based on the findings from distractor analysis, test items can be revised to improve their effectiveness. This iterative process helps in developing high-quality assessments that accurately measure student knowledge and skills.\n\nIn summary, distractor analysis is an essential step in the psychometric evaluation of multiple-choice assessments, ensuring that test items are both valid and reliable. By focusing on the performance of distractors, educators and test developers can enhance the quality of their assessments and the inferences drawn from them.
