    What are some common mistakes to avoid when using MLA formatting?
answer: >-
    When using MLA formatting, it's essential to avoid common mistakes that can undermine the professionalism and credibility of your work. Here are some key errors to watch out for:\n\n1. **Incorrect Header Setup**: Ensure that your header includes your last name and page number in the upper right corner of each page, starting from the first page.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Fonts and Sizes**: Stick to a consistent font (typically Times New Roman) and size (12-point) throughout your essay. Avoid using different fonts or sizes in various sections.\n\n3. **Improper Works Cited Page Formatting**: The Works Cited page should be on a new page at the end of your essay, titled "Works Cited," and formatted with hanging indentation (the first line of each citation is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented 1/2 inch).\n\n4. **Misquoting Sources**: Always ensure that quotes are accurate and properly attributed. Misquoting can lead to misinterpretation of the source material.\n\n5. **Omitting Page Numbers**: Always include page numbers in your in-text citations when applicable, starting from the first page of your essay.\n\n6. **Failing to Use Hanging Indentation**: Each citation in the Works Cited list should use hanging indentation, which means the first line is flush left, and all subsequent lines are indented.\n\n7. **Incorrect Punctuation and Capitalization**: Follow MLA guidelines for punctuation, capitalization, and italics. For instance, book titles should be italicized, while article titles should be in quotation marks.\n\n8. **Omitting In-Text Citations**: Every source referenced in your essay must have a corresponding in-text citation that matches the entry in the Works Cited page.\n\n9. **Not Double-Spacing**: Ensure that your entire essay, including the Works Cited page, is double-spaced.\n\n10. **Using a Title Page**: MLA format does not require a title page unless specified by your instructor. If you do include one, ensure it follows the correct format.\n\nBy avoiding these common mistakes, you can enhance the clarity and professionalism of your MLA-formatted work.
