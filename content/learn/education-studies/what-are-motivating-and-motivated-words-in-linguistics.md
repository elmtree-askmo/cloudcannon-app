    What are motivating and motivated words in linguistics?
answer: >-
    In linguistics, the concepts of motivating and motivated words are closely related to the idea of linguistic motivation, which refers to the non-arbitrary aspects of language form and structure. \n\n**Motivating Words**: These are the underlying words that serve as the source or basis for the formation of new words. They provide a semantic or formal foundation upon which other words are built. For example, in the relationship between the Slovak word "stôl" (meaning "table") and "stolík" (meaning "small table"), "stôl" acts as the motivating word.\n\n**Motivated Words**: These are the new words that are derived from the motivating words. They are formed based on the meanings or structures of the motivating words, reflecting a relationship that can be understood through their connection to everyday experiences or concepts. In the previous example, "stolík" is the motivated word that conveys a specific meaning related to the motivating word "stôl."\n\nThe relationship between motivating and motivated words can be seen as a formal and semantic connection, where the motivated word is a product of the linguistic processes that derive meaning from the motivating word. This concept is significant in word-formation analysis and helps in understanding how language evolves and how new lexical items are created. \n\nOverall, linguistic motivation plays a crucial role in language learning and teaching, as it allows learners to engage with the non-arbitrary aspects of language, enhancing their understanding and retention of vocabulary.
