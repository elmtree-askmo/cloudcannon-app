    What decision did the Supreme Court make in the IIT admission case?
answer: >-
    In the recent IIT admission case, the Supreme Court of India intervened to grant admission to Atul Kumar, a Dalit student who lost his seat at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dhanbad due to missing the deadline for fee payment. The court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct the authorities to admit him to the BTech course in Electrical Engineering, which he had originally been allotted.\n\nAtul Kumar, who comes from a marginalized background and is the son of a daily wager, had successfully cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) but was unable to pay the required fee of â‚¹17,500 on time. The Supreme Court's decision was seen as a significant relief for the 18-year-old, emphasizing the importance of ensuring access to education for deserving candidates from disadvantaged communities. The bench, led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, expressed that it could not allow such a talented individual to miss out on his opportunity for education.
