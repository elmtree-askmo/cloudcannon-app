    To resize and invert images using SciToolkit, you can follow these general steps based on the gathered information:\n\n### Steps for Resizing Images\n\n1. **Select an Image**: Choose the image you want to resize. This can be done using any image editing tool such as Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Preview.\n\n2. **Resize the Image**:\n   - **Google Slides**: Click on the image, then drag the corners to resize it while maintaining the aspect ratio. Alternatively, you can right-click the image, select "Format options," and manually enter the desired dimensions.\n   - **PowerPoint**: Similar to Google Slides, click on the image and drag the corners. You can also use the "Size" options in the "Format" tab to specify exact dimensions.\n   - **Preview (Mac)**: Open the image, go to the "Tools" menu, and select "Adjust Size." Enter the new width and height.\n\n3. **Save the Resized Image**: After resizing, save the image in a suitable format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) to ensure it can be uploaded to SciToolkit.\n\n### Steps for Inverting Images\n\n1. **Select an Image**: Open the image you want to invert in your chosen image editing tool.\n\n2. **Invert the Colors**:\n   - **Google Slides**: Unfortunately, Google Slides does not have a direct invert option. You may need to use an external image editor for this step.\n   - **PowerPoint**: Click on the image, go to the "Format" tab, select "Color," and choose "Recolor" to find an option that inverts the colors.\n   - **Preview (Mac)**: Open the image, go to the "Tools" menu, and select "Adjust Color." Use the sliders to adjust the color levels to achieve an inverted effect.\n\n3. **Save the Inverted Image**: Once the image is inverted, save it in a suitable format.\n\n### Uploading Images to SciToolkit\n\n1. **Upload the Images**: After resizing and inverting your images, you can upload them to SciToolkit. This typically involves navigating to the image section of your experiment setup and selecting the option to upload files.\n\n2. **List Images in SciToolkit**: Once uploaded, ensure that the images are listed correctly in your experiment setup so that they can be used in your experiments.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resize and invert images for use in your experiments within SciToolkit.
