    What is the difference between skimming and scanning in reading strategies?
answer: >-
    Skimming and scanning are two distinct reading strategies that serve different purposes in the process of reading comprehension.\n\n**Skimming** is a technique used to quickly gather the main ideas or general overview of a text. When skimming, a reader typically glances through headings, subheadings, introductory and concluding paragraphs, and any highlighted or bolded text. The goal is to understand the overall structure and key points without delving into the details. For example, a student might skim a textbook chapter to identify the main themes before deciding which sections to read in detail.\n\n**Scanning**, on the other hand, is a strategy employed to locate specific information within a text. This involves searching for particular keywords, phrases, or data points without reading every word. Scanning is useful when a reader needs to find a specific fact or answer a question quickly. For instance, if a student is looking for a specific date or statistic in a research article, they would scan the text to find that information efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between skimming and scanning lies in their objectives: skimming is for grasping the overall content and main ideas, while scanning is for finding specific details or information. Both strategies are valuable tools for effective reading and can enhance comprehension and retention of material.
