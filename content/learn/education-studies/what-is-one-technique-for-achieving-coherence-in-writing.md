    What is one technique for achieving coherence in writing?
answer: >-
    One effective technique for achieving coherence in writing is the use of **transitional expressions and phrases**. These linguistic tools help to strategically highlight connections between ideas, guiding the reader through the text in a logical manner. For instance, using phrases such as "however," "because," "therefore," "additionally," and "on the one hand... on the other" can clarify relationships between sentences and paragraphs, making the overall argument or narrative easier to follow.\n\nIncorporating these transitions not only enhances the flow of the writing but also reinforces the logical structure of the argument, ensuring that readers can easily understand how different points relate to one another. This technique is particularly useful in academic writing, where clarity and coherence are essential for effectively conveying complex ideas.
