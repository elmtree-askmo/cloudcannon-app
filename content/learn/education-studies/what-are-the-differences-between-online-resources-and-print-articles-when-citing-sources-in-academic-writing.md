    What are the differences between online resources and print articles when citing sources in academic writing?
answer: >-
    When citing sources in academic writing, there are notable differences between online resources and print articles. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Format and Structure**:\n   - **Print Articles**: Typically, citations for print articles follow a standard format that includes the author's name, publication year, article title, journal name, volume, issue number, and page range. For example, in APA format, a print article citation would look like this:\n     ```\n     Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. Title of Journal, Volume(Issue), Page range.\n     ```\n   - **Online Resources**: While online articles may follow similar structures, they also require the inclusion of a URL or DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to direct readers to the source. An example in APA format would be:\n     ```\n     Author, A. A. (Year, Month Date). Title of article. Title of Periodical. URL\n     ```\n\n2. **Access Date**:\n   - **Print Articles**: Generally, access dates are not required for print articles since they are static once published.\n   - **Online Resources**: Depending on the citation style, it may be necessary to include the date you accessed the online resource, especially if the content is subject to change.\n\n3. **Stability and Reliability**:\n   - **Print Articles**: These are often considered more stable and reliable since they are published in fixed formats and are less likely to change after publication.\n   - **Online Resources**: Online articles can be updated or removed, which may affect the reliability of the information. This is why including a retrieval date can be important.\n\n4. **Citation Styles**:\n   - Different citation styles (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) have specific guidelines for both online and print resources. For instance, the Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes the use of footnotes for both types of sources, but the formatting details may vary.\n\n5. **Treatment of Sources**:\n   - Regardless of the medium, it is essential to treat print articles as such, even if accessed online. This means adhering to the citation guidelines specific to print sources when applicable.\n\nIn summary, while the fundamental purpose of citations remains the same—providing credit to original authors and allowing readers to trace sources—the specific requirements for online resources differ from those for print articles, particularly in terms of format, stability, and the inclusion of URLs or access dates.
