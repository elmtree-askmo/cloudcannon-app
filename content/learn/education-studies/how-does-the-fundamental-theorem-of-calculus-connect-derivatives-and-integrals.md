    How does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connect derivatives and integrals?
answer: >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is a fundamental result in calculus that establishes a deep connection between differentiation and integration. It can be formally stated as follows:\n\nIf $ F $ is an antiderivative of a continuous function $ f $ on the interval $[a, b]$, then:\n\n$$\n\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n$$\n\n### Explanation of the Connection\n\n1. **Antiderivatives and Definite Integrals**: The FTC states that the definite integral of a function $ f $ over the interval $[a, b]$ can be computed using its antiderivative $ F $. This means that if you can find a function $ F $ such that $ F' = f $, you can evaluate the area under the curve of $ f $ from $ a $ to $ b $ simply by calculating \( F(b) - F(a) \).\n\n2. **Reversal of Operations**: The theorem illustrates that integration and differentiation are inverse processes. If you differentiate the antiderivative $ F $, you retrieve the original function $ f $. Conversely, if you integrate $ f $, you obtain $ F $ (up to a constant). This relationship is crucial for solving problems in calculus, as it allows for the evaluation of integrals without the need for Riemann sums.\n\n3. **Practical Applications**: The FTC simplifies the computation of areas under curves, which is a common application in physics, engineering, and economics. For example, to find the area under the curve of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 2 $, we compute:\n\n$$\n\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\nThis result not only provides the area but also reinforces the significance of the integral in understanding the accumulation of quantities.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus serves as a bridge between the concepts of differentiation and integration, allowing for the evaluation of definite integrals through antiderivatives. This connection is essential for both theoretical and practical applications in calculus, making it one of the cornerstones of mathematical analysis.
