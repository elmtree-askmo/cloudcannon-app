    What are the rules for capitalizing proper nouns and adjectives?
answer: >-
    In English, the rules for capitalizing proper nouns and adjectives are essential for maintaining clarity and proper grammar in writing. Here are the key rules:\n\n### Capitalization of Proper Nouns\n1. **Definition**: Proper nouns are specific names of people, places, organizations, or things. They are always capitalized.\n   - **Examples**: John, Paris, the Statue of Liberty, World War II.\n\n2. **Components of Names**: Capitalize each part of a person's name, including first, middle, and last names, as well as initials.\n   - **Example**: John F. Kennedy.\n\n3. **Titles**: Capitalize titles when they precede a name.\n   - **Example**: President Lincoln.\n\n4. **Days, Months, and Holidays**: Always capitalize the names of days of the week, months, and holidays.\n   - **Examples**: Monday, January, Christmas.\n\n5. **Specific Places and Events**: Capitalize names of specific geographical locations and significant historical events.\n   - **Examples**: the Grand Canyon, the Renaissance.\n\n### Capitalization of Proper Adjectives\n1. **Definition**: Proper adjectives are derived from proper nouns and are used to describe nouns. They are also capitalized.\n   - **Examples**: American literature, Shakespearean sonnet.\n\n2. **Hyphenated Adjectives**: In hyphenated adjectives, only the proper adjective is capitalized.\n   - **Example**: Italian-speaking Americans.\n\n3. **Common Nouns Following Proper Adjectives**: When a proper adjective precedes a common noun, the common noun remains lowercase.\n   - **Example**: German shepherd (the "German" is capitalized, but "shepherd" is not).\n\n### General Rules\n- Always capitalize the first word of a sentence.\n- In titles, capitalize all major words, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, while leaving prepositions and conjunctions in lowercase unless they are the first word.\n   - **Example**: "Of Mice and Men."\n\nBy following these rules, writers can ensure that their writing is clear and adheres to standard conventions of English grammar.
