    How do parenthetical citations differ from narrative style citations in APA format?
answer: >-
    In APA format, parenthetical citations and narrative style citations serve the same purpose of crediting sources but differ in their presentation within the text.\n\n1. **Parenthetical Citations**: This style places the citation at the end of a sentence within parentheses. It typically includes the author's last name, the year of publication, and the page number if applicable. For example: \n   - "The results indicate significant findings (Smith, 2020, p. 15)." \n   This format allows readers to quickly identify the source of information without interrupting the flow of the text.\n\n2. **Narrative Style Citations**: In contrast, narrative style citations incorporate the author's name directly into the text as part of the sentence. This method allows for a more fluid integration of sources. For example:\n   - "According to Smith (2020), the results indicate significant findings."\n   This approach emphasizes the author and their contribution to the discussion, making it a more engaging way to present information.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the placement of the citation: parenthetical citations are at the end of the sentence, while narrative citations are woven into the text itself. Both methods are essential for maintaining citation integrity and academic credibility in writing.
