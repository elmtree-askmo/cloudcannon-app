    What are the main components of an APA references page?
answer: >-
    The main components of an APA references page are as follows:\n\n1. **Title**: The page should be titled "References" and centered at the top of the page.\n\n2. **Alphabetical Order**: All entries must be arranged alphabetically by the last name of the first author. If there are multiple works by the same author, they should be listed chronologically, starting with the earliest publication.\n\n3. **Hanging Indent**: Each reference entry should have a hanging indent format, meaning that the first line of each citation is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented by 0.5 inches.\n\n4. **Author Information**: Each entry begins with the author's last name followed by their initials. For multiple authors, use an ampersand (&) before the last author's name.\n\n5. **Publication Year**: The year of publication is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's name.\n\n6. **Title of the Work**: The title of the work should be in italics and in sentence case (only the first word of the title and subtitle, as well as proper nouns, are capitalized).\n\n7. **Source Information**: Depending on the type of source, this may include the publisher's name, journal name, volume number, issue number, page range, and DOI or URL if applicable.\n\n8. **Consistency**: Ensure that all entries follow the same format and style, maintaining consistency throughout the references page.\n\nHere is an example of how a reference entry might look:\n\n```plaintext\nSmith, J. A. (2020). Understanding psychology: A comprehensive guide. Psychology Press.\n```\n\nIn summary, the references page is crucial for providing full citations of all sources used in the paper, ensuring proper attribution and allowing readers to locate the original sources. This practice is essential for maintaining citation integrity and preventing plagiarism in academic writing.
