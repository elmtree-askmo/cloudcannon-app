    Describe the key characteristics of Realism as an artistic movement.
answer: >-
    Realism is an artistic movement that emerged in the mid-19th century as a direct response to Romanticism. It is characterized by several key features:\n\n1. **Focus on Everyday Life**: Realism sought to depict ordinary people and everyday situations, emphasizing the lives of the working class and the struggles they faced. This marked a departure from the idealized and often dramatic subjects favored by Romantic artists.\n\n2. **Accuracy and Honesty**: Realist artists aimed to represent the world as it truly is, without embellishment or idealization. They strived for a truthful portrayal of their subjects, often highlighting social issues and the harsh realities of life.\n\n3. **Social Commentary**: Many Realist works contain a social or political message, reflecting the conditions of society at the time. Artists like Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet often focused on themes related to labor, poverty, and the human condition.\n\n4. **Naturalism**: While closely related to Realism, Naturalism emphasizes a more scientific approach to representation, often portraying subjects in their natural state. Realism, on the other hand, is more concerned with the artist's personal experience of the world.\n\n5. **Rejection of Romanticism**: Realism emerged as a reaction against the emotionalism and idealism of Romanticism. Realist artists sought to ground their work in reality, often using techniques that emphasized clarity and detail.\n\n6. **Diverse Subject Matter**: Realism did not limit itself to any specific subject matter; it encompassed a wide range of themes, including rural life, urban scenes, and the struggles of various social classes.\n\nNotable Realist artists include Gustave Courbet, who is often considered a pioneer of the movement, and Jean-François Millet, known for his depictions of peasant life. Their works exemplify the movement's commitment to portraying life with authenticity and depth. \n\nIn summary, Realism is defined by its commitment to depicting the world as it is, focusing on the lives of ordinary people and addressing social issues with honesty and accuracy.
