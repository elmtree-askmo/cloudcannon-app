    What factors should be considered when determining when to cite a source?
answer: >-
    When determining when to cite a source in academic writing, several key factors should be considered:\n\n1. **Quoting, Paraphrasing, or Summarizing**: You must cite a source whenever you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize someone else's ideas or findings. This includes using their exact words (quoting) or rephrasing their ideas (paraphrasing) in your own words. For example, if you were to quote a statement from a study, you would include a citation to acknowledge the original author.\n\n2. **Original Ideas and Research**: If you are building upon or referencing original ideas, theories, or research findings from another author, it is essential to cite that source. This not only gives credit to the original creator but also situates your work within the existing body of knowledge.\n\n3. **Use of Data or Statistics**: When you incorporate specific data, statistics, or findings from a study, you should cite the source of that information. This is crucial for maintaining the credibility of your work and allowing readers to verify the information.\n\n4. **Academic Integrity**: Citing sources is a fundamental aspect of academic integrity. Proper attribution prevents plagiarism, which is the unethical practice of using someone else's work or ideas without acknowledgment. Upholding academic integrity is essential for maintaining trust in scholarly communication.\n\n5. **Enhancing Persuasiveness**: Citing reputable sources can enhance the persuasiveness of your arguments. Referencing studies or research findings from respected institutions grounds your claims in empirical evidence, making them more compelling. This strategic integration of expert opinions not only bolsters your credibility but also enhances the overall effectiveness of your writing.\n\n6. **Clarifying Context**: Sometimes, citing a source can provide necessary context for your argument or discussion. This is particularly important when discussing complex issues or when your argument relies on specific historical or comparative data.\n\n7. **Reader's Ability to Verify Information**: Citing sources allows readers to locate the original material for further study or verification. This transparency is vital for academic discourse and helps readers understand the basis of your arguments.\n\nIn summary, you should cite a source whenever you are using someone else's ideas, research, or data, as well as to uphold academic integrity and enhance the credibility of your work. Proper citation practices are essential for effective academic writing and communication.
