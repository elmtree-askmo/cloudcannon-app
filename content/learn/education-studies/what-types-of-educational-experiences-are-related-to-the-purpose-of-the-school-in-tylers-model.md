    What types of educational experiences are related to the purpose of the school in Tyler’s model?
answer: >-
    In Tyler's model of curriculum development, the types of educational experiences are closely aligned with the clearly defined objectives of the curriculum. According to Tyler, the first step in curriculum development is to identify the educational objectives, which serve as a foundation for determining the appropriate learning experiences. \n\nFor instance, if a school sets an objective that students will write essays, the corresponding educational experiences would include activities such as essay demonstrations, writing workshops, and peer review sessions. These experiences are designed to help students achieve the specified objective of writing an essay. \n\nTyler's model emphasizes a systematic approach where each educational experience is purposefully selected to align with the curriculum's goals. This ensures that the learning experiences provided are relevant and effective in helping students meet the established objectives. The model also advocates for organizing these experiences in a logical sequence to facilitate learning.\n\nIn summary, the educational experiences in Tyler's model are directly related to the curriculum's objectives, ensuring that they are designed to help students attain specific learning outcomes.
