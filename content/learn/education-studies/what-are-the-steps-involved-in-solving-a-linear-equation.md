    What are the steps involved in solving a linear equation?
answer: >-
    To solve a linear equation, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Equation**: Start with a linear equation in the form $ ax + b = c $, where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants, and $ x $ is the variable you want to solve for.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: The goal is to get $ x $ by itself on one side of the equation. You can do this by performing inverse operations. Here are the steps involved:\n   - **Move Constant Terms**: If there are constants on the same side as the variable, move them to the opposite side by subtracting or adding. For example, if you have $ 7x - 10 = 3x + 6 $, you can start by moving $ 3x $ to the left side:\n     $$\n     7x - 3x - 10 = 6\n     $$\n     This simplifies to:\n     $$\n     4x - 10 = 6\n     $$\n\n   - **Add or Subtract**: Next, isolate the term with the variable by adding or subtracting the constant on the side with the variable. Continuing from the previous step:\n     $$\n     4x = 6 + 10\n     $$\n     This simplifies to:\n     $$\n     4x = 16\n     $$\n\n   - **Divide or Multiply**: Finally, if the variable is multiplied by a coefficient, divide both sides by that coefficient to solve for $ x $:\n     $$\n     x = \frac{16}{4}\n     $$\n     Thus, $ x = 4 $.\n\n3. **Check Your Solution**: Substitute the value of $ x $ back into the original equation to verify that both sides are equal. For example, substituting $ x = 4 $ back into the original equation $ 7x - 10 = 3x + 6 $:\n   $$\n   7(4) - 10 = 3(4) + 6 \\\n   28 - 10 = 12 + 6 \\\n   18 = 18\n   $$\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is confirmed.\n\n4. **Graphical Method (Optional)**: You can also solve linear equations graphically by plotting the equation on a coordinate system. The point where the line intersects the x-axis gives the value of $ x $.\n\n5. **Substitution Method (for Systems of Equations)**: If you are dealing with a system of linear equations, you can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into the second equation to find the values of both variables.\n\n6. **Cross Multiplication Method (for Two Variables)**: If you have a system of equations in the form $ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} $, you can cross-multiply to find the values of the variables.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively solve linear equations and understand the relationships between the variables involved.
