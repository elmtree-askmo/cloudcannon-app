    How is attendance recorded for Zoom classes?
answer: >-
    Attendance for Zoom classes can be recorded using several methods, primarily through the Zoom platform's built-in features. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how attendance is typically managed:\n\n1. **Registration Requirement**: To ensure accurate attendance records, it is recommended to require registration for each Zoom call, especially if it is not a Connect class. When setting up the meeting, you can check the box to "Require registration" and select the option for attendees to register for each occurrence if it is a recurring meeting.\n\n2. **Attendance Reports**: Zoom automatically tracks participants in all meetings. After a meeting concludes, attendance reports can be accessed approximately 30 minutes later. To retrieve these reports:\n   - Log in to your Zoom account on the web.\n   - Navigate to the "Reports" section and select "Usage."\n   - Ensure the date range includes the meeting you wish to check.\n   - Review and record the attendance data as needed for tracking or compliance purposes.\n\n3. **Real Names**: It is advisable to require students to use their real names when joining the Zoom session. This practice helps in accurately identifying participants and maintaining a reliable attendance record.\n\n4. **Documentation**: The Zoom attendance report serves as an essential tool for documenting attendance, assessing engagement, and fulfilling any compliance requirements related to class attendance.\n\nBy utilizing these methods, instructors can effectively manage attendance in Zoom classes, ensuring that they have accurate records for their courses.
