answer: >-
    The 19th century was a transformative period in art history, marked by significant movements and influential figures that shaped the trajectory of contemporary art. Here are some key movements and figures from this era, along with their lasting impact on modern artistic practices:\n\n### Key Movements\n\n1. **Romanticism (late 18th - mid-19th century)**:\n   - Characterized by an emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the sublime aspects of nature. Artists like Eugène Delacroix and Caspar David Friedrich explored themes of passion and the human experience, often in dramatic and expressive ways.\n   - **Influence**: Romanticism paved the way for later movements by emphasizing personal expression and the emotional depth of art, which continues to resonate in contemporary practices.\n\n2. **Realism (mid-19th century)**:\n   - A reaction against Romanticism, Realism focused on depicting everyday life and ordinary people. Artists such as Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet portrayed scenes of labor and rural life, emphasizing authenticity.\n   - **Influence**: Realism's commitment to depicting reality influenced later movements like Social Realism and documentary photography, which continue to address social issues in art.\n\n3. **Impressionism (late 19th century)**:\n   - This movement broke away from traditional techniques and subjects, focusing instead on capturing light and color in everyday scenes. Key figures included Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n   - **Influence**: Impressionism's innovative approach to color and brushwork laid the groundwork for modern art movements such as Post-Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism, encouraging artists to explore perception and abstraction.\n\n4. **Post-Impressionism (1886-1905)**:\n   - Building on Impressionism, artists like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, and Georges Seurat sought to express deeper emotional and structural elements in their work.\n   - **Influence**: This movement's exploration of color theory and form influenced the development of modern art, particularly in movements like Fauvism and Cubism.\n\n5. **Symbolism (late 19th century)**:\n   - Symbolism emerged as a reaction against realism, focusing on representing ideas and emotions through symbolic imagery. Artists like Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon were prominent figures.\n   - **Influence**: Symbolism's emphasis on the subjective experience and the use of metaphor influenced Surrealism and other modern movements that explore the unconscious.\n\n### Key Figures\n\n1. **Édouard Manet**:\n   - Often considered a precursor to Impressionism, Manet's works challenged traditional subjects and techniques, as seen in "Olympia" and "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe."\n   - **Influence**: His bold approach to composition and subject matter opened doors for future avant-garde movements.\n\n2. **Claude Monet**:\n   - A leading figure in Impressionism, Monet's focus on light and atmosphere transformed landscape painting.\n   - **Influence**: His techniques inspired generations of artists to explore color and light in innovative ways.\n\n3. **Vincent van Gogh**:\n   - Known for his emotive use of color and expressive brushwork, van Gogh's works reflect deep psychological and emotional states.\n   - **Influence**: His unique style and approach to color have had a profound impact on modern art, influencing Expressionism and beyond.\n\n4. **Paul Cézanne**:\n   - Often referred to as the father of modern art, Cézanne's exploration of form and perspective laid the groundwork for Cubism.\n   - **Influence**: His method of breaking down objects into geometric shapes influenced many 20th-century artists.\n\n5. **Henri Matisse**:\n   - A leading figure in Fauvism, Matisse's bold use of color and form challenged traditional artistic conventions.\n   - **Influence**: His work has inspired contemporary artists to embrace color and abstraction in their practices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 19th century was a battleground of artistic innovation, where traditional norms were challenged, and new ideas flourished. The movements and figures of this era not only transformed the art world of their time but also laid the foundation for contemporary artistic practices. The ongoing dialogue between past and present continues to shape the landscape of art today, as modern artists draw inspiration from the rich legacy of 19th-century art.
