    How are models and dioramas used as educational tools?
answer: >-
    Models and dioramas serve as powerful educational tools, particularly in the context of science and environmental education. They are three-dimensional representations that can depict realistic settings, allowing learners to engage with complex concepts in a more tangible way. Here are several key aspects of how dioramas are utilized in educational settings:\n\n1. **Model-Based Learning**: Dioramas can be understood as simplified external representations of scientific models. They promote model-based learning by allowing students to visualize and interact with the subject matter in a concrete manner. This approach helps students grasp abstract concepts by providing a physical context (Moormann & BÃ©langer).\n\n2. **Imagery and Concrete Learning**: Learning through dioramas occurs in the iconic mode, which is considered a more concrete way of learning. This method can enhance understanding by providing visual stimuli that represent scientific phenomena, making it easier for students to relate to the material (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994).\n\n3. **Environmental and Biodiversity Education**: Dioramas are particularly effective in environmental education, as they create realistic learning environments that reflect biodiversity. They can mediate learning by immersing students in scenarios that illustrate ecological relationships and environmental issues (Loveland et al., 2015).\n\n4. **Tactile Learning Opportunities**: For students who are blind or visually impaired, dioramas offer tactile experiences that can cater to various learning levels. This inclusivity allows all students to engage with the content in a meaningful way (Paddon, 2009).\n\n5. **Storytelling and Engagement**: Teachers have noted that dioramas provide opportunities for storytelling, creativity, and imagination. They encourage students to connect with scientific phenomena through narrative, enhancing engagement and retention of information (Tunnicliffe, 1995).\n\n6. **21st-Century Skills**: The integration of diorama projects in education aligns with the four Cs of 21st-century skills: Critical Thinking, Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication. This alignment emphasizes the relevance of dioramas in modern educational practices (Insley, 2008).\n\n7. **Dynamic Learning Experiences**: As instructional tools, dioramas transform the learning experience from static to dynamic. They encourage observation, inference, and hypothesis formulation, which are key aspects of scientific inquiry (Modeling in the Classroom).\n\nIn summary, dioramas are versatile educational tools that enhance learning by providing visual, tactile, and narrative experiences. They are particularly effective in promoting understanding in science and environmental education, making them valuable assets in contemporary educational practices.
