    What are the formatting requirements for MLA citation?
answer: >-
    The formatting requirements for MLA (Modern Language Association) citation are as follows:\n\n### In-Text Citations\n1. **General Format**: In-text citations typically include the author's last name and the page number from which the information is taken, formatted as (Author Page Number).\n   - **Example**: (Smith 23)\n   \n2. **Citing Multiple Authors**:\n   - For two authors, use "and" to connect their names: (Smith and Jones 23).\n   - For three or more authors, use the first author's last name followed by "et al.": (Smith et al. 23).\n\n3. **When the Author is Mentioned in the Text**: If the author's name is part of the narrative, only the page number is included in parentheses.\n   - **Example**: According to Smith, ... (23).\n\n### Works Cited Page\n1. **Title**: The page should be titled "Works Cited" and placed at the end of the paper.\n2. **Format**: Each entry should be formatted with a hanging indent, meaning the first line of each citation is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented.\n3. **Basic Format for a Book**:\n   - Author's Last Name, First Name. *Title of the Work*. Publisher, Year.\n   - **Example**: Taylor, John. *Title of the Work*. Publisher, 2020.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: Pay close attention to punctuation, as incorrect punctuation can lead to incorrect citations.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If a source does not have page numbers (common with online articles), you can omit the page number in the in-text citation.\n- Always verify with your professor or assignment guidelines for any specific requirements or variations in formatting.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that your citations are clear and consistent, which is essential for academic writing in the humanities.
