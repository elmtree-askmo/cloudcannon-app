    How do case studies differ from other qualitative research methods?
answer: >-
    Case studies differ from other qualitative research methods in several key ways:\n\n1. **Focus and Scope**: Case study research is specifically designed to provide an in-depth understanding of a particular case or multiple cases within their real-life context. This contrasts with other qualitative methods, such as ethnography, which focuses on cultural groups, or phenomenology, which seeks to understand the essence of lived experiences. In case studies, the unit of analysis can be an event, program, activity, or individual, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of complex phenomena.\n\n2. **Data Collection**: Case studies rely heavily on qualitative data, utilizing multiple sources of information such as interviews, observations, documents, and artifacts. This multi-faceted approach allows researchers to gather rich, detailed data that can provide insights into the case being studied. In contrast, other qualitative methods may focus more narrowly on specific types of data, such as narrative accounts in narrative research or shared experiences in phenomenological studies.\n\n3. **Methodological Flexibility**: Case study research is characterized by its methodological flexibility, allowing researchers to incorporate various paradigmatic positions and study designs. This adaptability enables researchers to tailor their approach to the specific needs of their study, which is less common in more rigid qualitative methodologies.\n\n4. **Purpose and Application**: The primary aim of case study research is to develop a deep understanding of a case or cases, often leading to the generation of theories or practical applications. This is distinct from other qualitative methods that may prioritize storytelling, essence description, or cultural interpretation. Case studies are particularly valuable in fields like healthcare research, where they can inform program evaluations and intervention development.\n\n5. **Contextual Analysis**: Case studies emphasize the importance of context in understanding the phenomena being studied. Researchers often explore how various factors within the environment influence the case, which may not be as pronounced in other qualitative approaches that focus more on individual experiences or cultural patterns.\n\nIn summary, while case studies share some similarities with other qualitative research methods, they are unique in their focus on in-depth analysis of specific cases, reliance on diverse qualitative data sources, methodological flexibility, and emphasis on contextual understanding.
