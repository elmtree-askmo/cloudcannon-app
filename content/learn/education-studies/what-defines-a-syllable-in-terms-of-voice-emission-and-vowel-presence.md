    What defines a syllable in terms of voice emission and vowel presence?
answer: >-
    A syllable is defined as a unit of sound produced by a single emission of voice, and it must contain at least one vowel. This is a fundamental characteristic of syllables in linguistic terms. For example, in the word 'chat', there is one syllable, while in 'maison', there are two syllables: 'mai' and 'son'. \n\nSyllables can be categorized into two types: **sonorous syllables** and **mute syllables**. A sonorous syllable is one that ends with a pronounced sound, contributing to the clarity of pronunciation. In contrast, a mute syllable may not have a pronounced ending sound.\n\nThe presence of vowels is crucial for the formation of syllables, as they serve as the core sound around which the syllable is structured. Without a vowel, a syllable cannot exist, which highlights the importance of vowels in phonetics and syllable construction. \n\nIn summary, a syllable is characterized by:\n1. Being produced by a single voice emission.\n2. Containing at least one vowel.\n3. Being classified into sonorous and mute types based on the presence of pronounced sounds.
