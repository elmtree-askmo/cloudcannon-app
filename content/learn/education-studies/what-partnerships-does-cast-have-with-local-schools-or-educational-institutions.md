    What partnerships does CAST have with local schools or educational institutions?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) actively develops partnerships with various educational institutions to enhance learning opportunities for students and staff. These collaborations are aimed at integrating practical skills with theoretical knowledge, thereby enriching the educational experience.\n\nCAST works with a range of organizations in the Greater Toronto Area, engaging in both formal and informal partnerships. These partnerships often involve local schools and educational institutions, where CAST collaborates with educators to explore innovative teaching methods and improve learning outcomes. The organization is committed to fostering meaningful connections that support children, youth, and families from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nAdditionally, CAST partners with higher education institutions to help shape the next generation of educators and school leaders. This includes initiatives such as research partnerships, mentoring programs, and dual credit opportunities, which are designed to deepen the relationship between CAST and educational institutions.\n\nThrough these partnerships, CAST not only contributes to the educational landscape but also ensures that the needs of the community are met, ultimately aiming to strengthen the support systems available for children and families in Toronto.
