    Can you provide examples of grammatical words in English?
answer: >-
    Grammatical words, also known as function words, play a crucial role in the structure of sentences by helping to convey relationships between lexical words (content words) and providing grammatical context. Here are some examples of grammatical words in English:\n\n1. **Conjunctions**: These words connect clauses or sentences. Examples include:\n   - **and**\n   - **but**\n   - **or**\n   - **if**\n\n2. **Prepositions**: These words indicate relationships between nouns (or pronouns) and other words in a sentence. Examples include:\n   - **in**\n   - **on**\n   - **at**\n   - **with**\n\n3. **Articles**: These words define a noun as specific or unspecific. Examples include:\n   - **the** (definite article)\n   - **a** (indefinite article)\n   - **an** (indefinite article)\n\n4. **Pronouns**: These words replace nouns to avoid repetition. Examples include:\n   - **he**\n   - **she**\n   - **it**\n   - **they**\n\n5. **Auxiliary Verbs**: These verbs help to form tenses, moods, and voices of other verbs. Examples include:\n   - **is**\n   - **are**\n   - **have**\n   - **will**\n\n6. **Determiners**: These words introduce nouns and specify them. Examples include:\n   - **this**\n   - **that**\n   - **my**\n   - **some**\n\nThese grammatical words are essential for constructing meaningful sentences and understanding the relationships between different parts of speech in English. They help to clarify the structure and meaning of sentences, making them integral to effective communication.
