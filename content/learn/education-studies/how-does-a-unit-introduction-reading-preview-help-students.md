    How does a unit introduction reading preview help students?
answer: >-
    A unit introduction reading preview is a valuable strategy that helps students in several ways:\n\n1. **Activating Prior Knowledge**: By previewing the text, students can activate their existing knowledge about the topic. This process encourages them to think about what they already know, which can enhance their understanding and retention of new information.\n\n2. **Setting Purpose for Reading**: When students skim the introduction, headings, and subheadings, they can formulate questions about the text that they hope to answer as they read. This sets a clear purpose for their reading, making it more focused and engaging.\n\n3. **Improving Comprehension**: Previewing allows students to make predictions about the content, which can improve their comprehension. By anticipating what they will learn, they are more likely to engage with the material actively.\n\n4. **Identifying Key Points**: A preview helps students identify key points and concepts that will be discussed in the text. Understanding these points beforehand can guide their reading and help them to concentrate on important information.\n\n5. **Enhancing Engagement**: Engaging in a preview activity, such as discussing illustrations or key terms, can make the reading experience more interactive and less monotonous. This active involvement can lead to better retention of the material.\n\n6. **Facilitating Collaborative Learning**: In a collaborative setting, students can share their predictions and questions with peers, fostering a deeper discussion about the text and enhancing their analytical skills.\n\nOverall, a unit introduction reading preview equips students with the tools they need to approach their reading assignments with confidence and purpose, ultimately leading to improved academic performance and a more profound understanding of the material.
