    How should in-text citations be handled for three or more authors?
answer: >-
    In APA style (7th edition), when handling in-text citations for works with three or more authors, you should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **First Citation**: For the first citation in your text, include the last name of the first author followed by "et al." and the year of publication. For example:\n   - (Smith et al., 2020)\n\n2. **Subsequent Citations**: For all subsequent citations of the same work, you will continue to use the same format:\n   - (Smith et al., 2020)\n\n3. **Narrative Citations**: If you are incorporating the citation into the narrative of your text, it would look like this:\n   - Smith et al. (2020) argue that...\n\n4. **Page Numbers**: If you are quoting directly or referring to a specific part of the work, include the page number as well:\n   - (Smith et al., 2020, p. 15)\n\nThis format helps to streamline citations in your writing while ensuring that you give appropriate credit to the authors involved. Remember that each source listed in your reference page must correspond to at least one in-text citation in the body of your paper.
