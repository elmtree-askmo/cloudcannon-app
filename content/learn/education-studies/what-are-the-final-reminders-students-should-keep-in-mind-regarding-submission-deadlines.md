    What are the final reminders students should keep in mind regarding submission deadlines?
answer: >-
    When it comes to submission deadlines, students should keep the following final reminders in mind:\n\n1. **Know the Final Grade Submission Deadline**: Faculty are required to submit all final grades by 2:00 p.m. 48 hours after the last final examination date. This is a change from the previous policy, which required grades to be submitted 48 hours after each individual final exam.\n\n2. **Plan for the Exam Period**: Students should ensure they are on campus through the last day of the exam period. Final exam dates are typically published a few weeks before the semester begins, and students should check the official university academic calendar for any updates.\n\n3. **Set Personal Deadlines**: To avoid last-minute stress, students should aim to complete their assignments a few days before the official submission date. For example, if the submission date is September 24, students should aim to finish by September 22. This allows time for any unforeseen issues and ensures a smoother submission process.\n\n4. **Organize and Track Deadlines**: Keeping a list or spreadsheet of all required essays and their deadlines can help students manage their time effectively. This organization is crucial for staying on track and ensuring that no deadlines are missed.\n\n5. **Feedback and Revision Periods**: After submitting drafts, students should be aware that there will be periods for feedback and revision. Timely submission of drafts is essential for receiving constructive feedback, which can significantly improve the final product.\n\n6. **Avoid Overdue Submissions**: Late submissions can lead to significant penalties or project failures. Students should prioritize their time management strategies to ensure they meet all deadlines without unnecessary stress.\n\nBy keeping these reminders in mind, students can navigate their final exam and essay submission processes more effectively, leading to a more successful academic experience.
