    What criteria are used for student promotions?
answer: >-
    The criteria for student promotions vary by grade level and specific student needs, including considerations for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and English language learner (ELL) status. Here are the key criteria used for student promotions:\n\n1. **Grade Level Requirements**: Each school must establish and implement a promotion policy that specifies the criteria for promoting students from one grade to the next. For example, students in grades K-3 are expected to develop essential skills in reading, writing, and mathematics.\n\n2. **Holistic Review**: Schools must conduct a holistic review of students' progress in English language arts and mathematics. This includes evaluating multiple measures of student performance rather than relying solely on state test scores.\n\n3. **Specific Standards**: For students in high school (grades 9-12), promotion is based on the number of credits earned. For instance, to be promoted from 11th to 12th grade, students must have successfully completed a minimum of 17 units of credit and participate in state-mandated assessments.\n\n4. **Individualized Standards**: Students with IEPs may have modified promotion standards as specified in their plans. This means that their promotion criteria may differ from those of their peers based on their unique educational needs.\n\n5. **Promotion in Doubt (PID)**: Schools must designate students as "promotion in doubt" based on a comprehensive assessment of their academic progress, particularly in core subjects.\n\n6. **No Separate Criteria for ELLs**: As of the 2023-2024 school year, there are no separate promotional criteria specifically for English learners, but schools are required to ensure that these students are making adequate progress.\n\nOverall, the promotion criteria are designed to ensure that students are adequately prepared for the next grade level while considering individual circumstances and educational needs.
