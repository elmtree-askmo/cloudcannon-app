    What is the primary focus of the PSA method in problem-solving?
answer: >-
    The primary focus of the PSA method, which stands for Problem, Steps, Answer, is to provide a structured approach to problem-solving in technical classes, such as math and science. This framework emphasizes the importance of recording sample problems, detailing the steps taken to solve them, and clearly stating the final answer.\n\nKey aspects of the PSA method include:\n\n1. **Recording Sample Problems**: Students are encouraged to document specific problems they encounter, which serves as a reference for future study and practice.\n\n2. **Detailing Steps**: The method stresses the need to outline each step taken to arrive at the solution. This is crucial because it helps students understand the logical progression of their thought process.\n\n3. **Final Answer**: After detailing the steps, students should clearly state the final answer to the problem, reinforcing the outcome of their problem-solving efforts.\n\n4. **Understanding the Reasoning**: Beyond merely recording steps, the PSA method encourages students to annotate their work, explaining why certain formulas or methods were applied. This deeper understanding is essential for mastering the material and applying concepts to different problems.\n\n5. **Conceptual Understanding**: The PSA method aims to foster a conceptual understanding of the subject matter, rather than just rote memorization of procedures.\n\nIn summary, the PSA method is designed to enhance problem-solving skills in technical subjects by promoting a thorough understanding of the processes involved, thereby preparing students for more complex applications of their knowledge.
