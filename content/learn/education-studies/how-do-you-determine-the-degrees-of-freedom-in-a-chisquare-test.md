    How do you determine the degrees of freedom in a chi-square test?
answer: >-
    To determine the degrees of freedom (df) in a chi-square test, you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\ndf = (rows - 1) \times (columns - 1)\n$$\n\nHere’s how to apply this formula step-by-step:\n\n1. **Count the Rows**: Identify the number of categories or groups for the first variable (let's call it Variable 1) and count how many rows are present in your contingency table.\n\n2. **Count the Columns**: Identify the number of categories or groups for the second variable (Variable 2) and count how many columns are present in your contingency table.\n\n3. **Subtract One**: For both the number of rows and the number of columns, subtract one from each count.\n\n4. **Multiply**: Finally, multiply the results from step 3 to get the degrees of freedom.\n\nFor example, if you have a contingency table with 3 rows and 4 columns, the degrees of freedom would be calculated as follows:\n\n- Rows: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Columns: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Degrees of Freedom: 2 × 3 = 6\n\nThe degrees of freedom are crucial because they help determine the critical value of the chi-square statistic, which is used to assess the significance of the association between the variables. A small value of df (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) may indicate a statistically significant association, while a larger value (e.g., 10, 20, or 30) may suggest that the association is not statistically significant.\n\nIn summary, the degrees of freedom for a chi-square test of independence is calculated based on the number of categories in the variables being analyzed, and it plays a vital role in interpreting the results of the test.
