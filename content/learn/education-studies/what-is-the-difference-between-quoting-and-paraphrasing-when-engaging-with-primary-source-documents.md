    What is the difference between quoting and paraphrasing when engaging with primary source documents?
answer: >-
    The difference between quoting and paraphrasing when engaging with primary source documents is significant in academic writing, particularly in the context of avoiding plagiarism and accurately representing the original text.\n\n**Quoting** involves directly reproducing a segment of the original text word-for-word. When you quote, you must use quotation marks to indicate that the words are not your own and provide a proper citation to credit the original author. For example, if a primary source document states, "The tone of the old paper was never entirely uniform," you would include this exact phrase in your writing, along with a citation that points to the source of the quote.\n\n**Paraphrasing**, on the other hand, requires you to restate the original text in your own words while maintaining the original meaning. This involves altering both the wording and the structure of the original sentence. For instance, you might paraphrase the previous quote as follows: "The old paper exhibited variations in tone and lacked uniformity." In this case, you still need to provide a citation to acknowledge the original source, but you do not use quotation marks since the phrasing is your own.\n\nThe key distinctions are:\n- **Quoting**: Directly uses the original text, requires quotation marks, and must be cited.\n- **Paraphrasing**: Rephrases the original text in your own words, does not require quotation marks, but still must be cited.\n\nBoth methods are essential for academic integrity, as they allow you to incorporate the ideas of others while giving appropriate credit, thus avoiding plagiarism. Proper paraphrasing captures the essence of the original text without copying it verbatim, which is crucial when working with primary source documents.
