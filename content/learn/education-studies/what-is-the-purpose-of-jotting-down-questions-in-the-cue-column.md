    What is the purpose of jotting down questions in the cue column?
answer: >-
    The purpose of jotting down questions in the cue column of the Cornell note-taking method is multifaceted:\n\n1. **Clarification of Understanding**: Writing questions helps to clarify meanings and concepts that may not be fully understood during the initial note-taking process. This encourages deeper engagement with the material.\n\n2. **Reinforcement of Learning**: Questions serve as prompts that reinforce learning. They encourage the note-taker to think critically about the material and to seek answers, which can enhance retention and understanding.\n\n3. **Establishing Relationships**: By formulating questions, students can reveal relationships between different concepts. This helps in organizing thoughts and understanding how various ideas connect within the broader context of the subject matter.\n\n4. **Facilitating Review**: The cue column acts as a study aid during review sessions. Questions can guide the review process, allowing students to test their knowledge and recall information more effectively.\n\n5. **Encouraging Active Learning**: The act of generating questions promotes active learning, as it requires the student to engage with the content rather than passively absorbing information.\n\nIn summary, the cue column is a critical component of the Cornell method that enhances comprehension, retention, and the overall effectiveness of the note-taking process.
