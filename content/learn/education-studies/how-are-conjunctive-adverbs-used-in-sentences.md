    How are conjunctive adverbs used in sentences?
answer: >-
    Conjunctive adverbs are essential tools in writing that help connect two independent clauses while also showing the relationship between them. They enhance coherence and can indicate various relationships such as contrast, cause and effect, or sequence. \n\nWhen using a conjunctive adverb to connect two independent clauses, proper punctuation is crucial. A semicolon should be placed before the conjunctive adverb, and a comma should follow it. For example:\n\n- "She loves to read; however, she doesn't have much time to do it."\n- "He wanted to visit the museum; however, it was closed for renovations."\n\nSome common examples of conjunctive adverbs include "however," "therefore," "moreover," "nevertheless," "consequently," "furthermore," "otherwise," and "similarly." These adverbs not only connect ideas but also clarify the relationship between them, making the writing more cohesive.\n\nIn summary, conjunctive adverbs serve a crucial role in writing by providing transitions that help the reader understand the connections between different ideas or clauses. Proper usage of these adverbs can significantly enhance the clarity and flow of your writing.
