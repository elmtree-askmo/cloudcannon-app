    What topics are covered under the 'Rock Types' section in the exam?
answer: >-
    In the 'Rock Types' section of the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science examination, the following topics are typically covered:\n\n1. **The Rock Cycle**: Understanding the continuous process of rock formation and transformation.\n2. **Formation of Igneous Rocks**: This includes the characteristics of igneous rocks, distinguishing between extrusive (formed from lava at the surface) and intrusive (formed from magma below the surface) types.\n3. **Formation of Sedimentary Rocks**: Identifying how sedimentary rocks are formed through processes such as compaction and cementation of sediments.\n4. **Formation of Metamorphic Rocks**: Recognizing how existing rocks are transformed into metamorphic rocks through heat, pressure, or chemical processes.\n5. **Identifiable Characteristics of Each Rock Type**: This involves understanding the physical and chemical properties that differentiate igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks.\n6. **Weathering and Erosion**: The processes that break down rocks and transport sediments, contributing to the rock cycle.\n7. **Uses of Different Types of Rocks in Industry**: Exploring how various rock types are utilized in construction, manufacturing, and other industries.\n\nThese topics provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles related to rock types and their significance in the natural world.
