    What trends have been observed in the representation of low-income students over time?
answer: >-
    Trends in the representation of low-income students in higher education have shown a complex and often contradictory landscape over time. Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **Stable Representation in Selective Colleges**: A comprehensive study indicated that the socioeconomic makeup of highly selective colleges has remained largely unchanged over the past century. Specifically, the proportion of low- and middle-income students at these institutions was reported to be the same in 2013 as it was in 1923, despite a significant increase in overall access to higher education during that time.\n\n2. **Increasing Enrollment of Low-Income Students Overall**: While the representation at selective colleges has stagnated, there has been an increase in the overall enrollment of low-income students in undergraduate education. For instance, in the 2015-16 academic year, 31% of enrolled students were in poverty, up from 21% two decades earlier. This reflects a broader trend of increasing numbers of low-income students in higher education, although this growth does not necessarily translate to selective institutions.\n\n3. **Economic Diversity in K-12 Education**: The percentage of K-12 students eligible for Free or Reduced-Price Lunches rose significantly from 31% in 1989 to 57% in 2020. This increase in low-income students in the K-12 system suggests a growing pool of potential college students from lower-income backgrounds.\n\n4. **Challenges in Enrollment**: Despite the increasing number of low-income students in the K-12 system, recent data indicates that enrollment rates have declined sharply among low-income students, particularly in nonprofit two-year and for-profit colleges. This decline contrasts with the continued growth in enrollment at four-year colleges, albeit at a slower pace.\n\n5. **Pell Grant Recipients**: The New York Times College Access Index has shown that while some selective colleges have increased their enrollment of Pell Grant recipients (students from low-income families), many institutions have seen a decrease in their share of low-income students over the past decade.\n\n6. **Impact of Economic Factors**: Economic diversity among students is influenced by various factors, including family income and the financial burden of attending college. For example, students from families earning less than $30,000 faced a wide range of net prices for attending selective colleges, with many institutions charging significantly more than $10,000 per year, which can deter low-income students from applying.\n\nIn summary, while there has been an overall increase in the representation of low-income students in higher education, particularly in broader enrollment figures, the trends at selective colleges reveal a concerning stagnation. This highlights ongoing challenges in achieving equitable access to higher education for low-income students, despite broader societal changes.
