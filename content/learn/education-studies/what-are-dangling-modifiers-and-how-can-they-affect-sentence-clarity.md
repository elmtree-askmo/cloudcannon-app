    What are dangling modifiers, and how can they affect sentence clarity?
answer: >-
    Dangling modifiers are phrases or clauses that are intended to modify a word but are not clearly attached to that word in the sentence. This can lead to confusion or ambiguity about what the modifier is describing, ultimately affecting the clarity of the sentence.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence:\n\n"Running down the street, the dog barked at the mailman."\n\nIn this case, the modifier "Running down the street" seems to suggest that the dog is doing the running, which is not accurate. The intended subject (the person running) is missing, leading to a dangling modifier. A clearer version would be:\n\n"Running down the street, I saw the dog barking at the mailman."\n\nHere, it is clear that "I" is the one running, thus eliminating the ambiguity.\n\nThe impact of dangling modifiers on sentence clarity can be significant. They can mislead readers, create confusion, and obscure the intended meaning of the sentence. To avoid dangling modifiers, it is essential to ensure that modifiers are placed next to the words they are meant to modify, or to rephrase the sentence to clarify the intended meaning.
