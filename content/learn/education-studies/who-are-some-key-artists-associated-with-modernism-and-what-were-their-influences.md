answer: >-
    Key artists associated with Modernism include:\n\n1. **Georges Seurat**: Known for developing the technique of pointillism, Seurat's work exemplified the shift towards a more scientific approach to color and composition. His painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" is a hallmark of this technique, showcasing how small dots of color can blend visually from a distance.\n\n2. **Henri Matisse**: A leading figure in Fauvism, Matisse was renowned for his bold use of color and expressive brushwork. His works, such as "The Dance," reflect a departure from realistic representation, focusing instead on emotional expression and the beauty of color.\n\n3. **Mainie Jellett**: An influential modernist artist in Ireland, Jellett introduced European avant-garde styles to Irish art. As a founding member of the Society of Dublin Painters, she played a crucial role in promoting modern art through exhibitions, emphasizing abstraction and innovative techniques.\n\n4. **Evie Hone**: Also associated with the Society of Dublin Painters, Hone was known for her vibrant stained glass work and paintings that often reflected her interest in abstraction. Her contributions were significant in elevating the status of women artists in Ireland during the modernist period.\n\n5. **Norah McGuinness**: McGuinness blended modernism with Irish themes, exploring the relationship between landscape and human experience. Her unique style made her a significant figure in the early 20th-century art scene.\n\n6. **Vincent van Gogh**: Although primarily associated with Post-Impressionism, van Gogh's emotive use of color and brushwork influenced many modernist artists. His works often conveyed deep emotional resonance, paving the way for future explorations of expression in art.\n\n7. **Pablo Picasso**: A central figure in the development of Cubism, Picasso's innovative approach to form and perspective challenged traditional representations in art. His works, such as "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," marked a significant turning point in modern art.\n\n8. **Marcel Duchamp**: Known for his conceptual approach, Duchamp's work, particularly "Fountain," questioned the very definition of art and introduced ideas of ready-mades, which had a profound impact on the direction of modern art.\n\nThese artists were influenced by various factors, including the rapid changes in society, technology, and philosophy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The modernist movement was characterized by a desire to break free from traditional artistic conventions, embracing experimentation, individualism, and new forms of expression that reflected the complexities of contemporary life.
