    How many terms are included in the definitions section, and what criteria are used for their selection?
answer: >-
    The definitions section of the quiz includes a total of six terms. Students are required to choose four out of these six terms to define. Each definition is worth five marks, and the expectation is that students provide a clear and concise explanation, which can be in the form of a short paragraph or a couple of lines. \n\nThe criteria for the selection of these terms are based on their relevance to key concepts from the course. This ensures that the definitions assess the student's understanding of important ideas that have been covered in the course material. The focus is on clarity and accuracy in the definitions provided by the students.
