    How does the ICF define and assess coaching competencies?
answer: >-
    The International Coaching Federation (ICF) defines coaching as a partnership with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. To assess coaching competencies, the ICF has developed a set of Core Competencies that serve as the foundation for the credentialing process, including the ICF Credentialing Exam.\n\nThe ICF Core Competencies are designed to enhance understanding of the skills and approaches used in the coaching profession. These competencies are grouped into four categories, which include:\n\n1. **Setting the Foundation**: Establishing the coaching agreement and ethical guidelines.\n2. **Co-creating the Relationship**: Building trust and safety, maintaining a coaching presence, and fostering a supportive environment.\n3. **Communicating Effectively**: Active listening, powerful questioning, and direct communication.\n4. **Facilitating Learning and Results**: Creating awareness, designing actions, planning and goal setting, and managing progress.\n\nTo evaluate a coach's proficiency in these competencies, the ICF employs the Professional Certified Coach (PCC) Markers. These markers are specific behaviors that assessors listen for during recorded coaching conversations. The updated PCC Markers, released in October 2020, align with the new ICF Core Competency Model and are used to determine the skill level of coaches at the PCC level.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating the PCC Markers, candidates for the PCC credential must have completed at least 125 hours of qualified education and accumulated a minimum of 500 hours of coaching experience. They must also show a proficient application of the ICF Core Competencies and adhere to the ICF Code of Ethics.\n\nOverall, the ICF's approach to defining and assessing coaching competencies emphasizes a structured framework that supports the professional development of coaches and ensures high standards within the coaching profession.
