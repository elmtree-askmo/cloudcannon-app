    How do infinitives function as adverbs?
answer: >-
    Infinitives function as adverbs when they provide additional information about verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs in a sentence. They typically answer questions such as "why?" or "for what purpose?" regarding the action of the verb. \n\nFor example, in the sentence "Johnny joined the military to serve his country," the infinitive phrase "to serve his country" modifies the verb "joined" by explaining the purpose of Johnny's action. Similarly, in "She studied hard to pass the exam," the infinitive "to pass" clarifies the reason for her studying.\n\nInfinitives can also modify adjectives. For instance, in the sentence "She is eager to learn," the infinitive "to learn" modifies the adjective "eager," indicating what she is eager about.\n\nIn summary, infinitives as adverbs enhance the meaning of the sentence by providing context about the action, often indicating purpose or reason.
