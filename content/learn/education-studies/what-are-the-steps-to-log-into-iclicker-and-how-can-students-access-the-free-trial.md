Look for an option to sign up or register.\n\n3. **Log In**: Once you have an account, enter your credentials (username and password) to log in.\n\n4. **Access the Free Trial**: After logging in, look for an option that mentions a free trial. This may be prominently displayed on the dashboard or under account settings. Follow the prompts to activate your free trial.\n\n5. **Download the iClicker App**: If required, download the iClicker app on your device to participate in class activities.\n\n6. **Participate in Class**: Once logged in and set up, you can start using iClicker for interactive participation in your biology class.\n\nThe free trial is particularly beneficial for students who are not ready to commit to a paid subscription, allowing them to experience the platform's features before making a financial decision. \n\nIf you encounter any issues during the login process or while accessing the free trial, consider reaching out to your instructor or the iClicker support team for assistance.
