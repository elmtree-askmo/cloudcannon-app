    What is the primary function of the tréma in French, and on which vowels is it commonly placed?
answer: >-
    The primary function of the tréma in French is to indicate that two consecutive vowels should be pronounced separately, rather than as a single sound. This diacritical mark helps clarify pronunciation and avoid confusion between words that might otherwise sound similar.\n\nThe tréma is commonly placed on the vowels 'i' and 'u'. For example:\n- In the word "naïve," the tréma over the 'i' indicates that the 'a' and 'i' are pronounced distinctly.\n- In the word "Noël," the tréma over the 'e' signifies that the 'o' and 'e' are pronounced separately, which is crucial for correct pronunciation.\n\nIn summary, the tréma serves to ensure clarity in pronunciation by separating vowel sounds, and it is typically found on the vowels 'i' and 'u', as well as occasionally on 'e' in specific contexts.
