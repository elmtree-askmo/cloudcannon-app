answer: >-
    The Go Global Award is a funding opportunity designed to support students who wish to participate in international learning experiences through Go Global programming. The award aims to assist students who may face barriers to participation, particularly those who are historically marginalized or underrepresented.\n\n### Application Process\nStudents interested in applying for the Go Global Award must follow a straightforward application process, which includes:\n\n1. **Submission of an Online Form**: Applicants need to fill out an online application form.\n2. **Personal Statement**: A short personal statement is required, where students articulate their interest and plans for their international experience.\n3. **Pre-Screening and Selection**: The application undergoes a rigorous three-tiered review process. Initially, there is a pre-screening phase where applications are ranked. The top 20% of nominations are then cross-reviewed for consistency, leading to the selection of finalists.\n\n### Eligibility and Funding\nThe Go Global Award provides different funding amounts based on the type of experience:\n- **$5,000** for Winter term-based experiences.\n- **$2,000** for Summer Abroad, Global Seminar, and Research experiences.\n\n### Important Dates\n- The deadline to apply for the Global Pathfinder Award, which is part of the Go Global funding opportunities, is November 8, 2024. Award recipients will be notified of their funding before the Go Global application deadline.\n\n### Additional Support\nStudents are encouraged to consult with a Go Global advisor for guidance on the application process and to discuss their eligibility for various awards.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that students have the necessary support and resources to successfully apply for funding to enhance their global educational experiences.
