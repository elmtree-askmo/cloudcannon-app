    What is the definition of a morpheme?
answer: >-
    A morpheme is defined as the smallest meaningful unit of language that cannot be further divided into smaller parts. It can be a complete word, such as "dog," or a component of a word, such as the suffix "-s" in "dogs." Morphemes are essential in understanding the structure and meaning of words in a language.\n\nMorphemes can be classified into two main types:\n\n1. **Free Morphemes**: These are morphemes that can stand alone as words and convey meaning independently. Examples include words like "house," "book," and "light."\n\n2. **Bound Morphemes**: These morphemes cannot stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes to convey meaning. Examples include prefixes and suffixes, such as "un-" in "unhappy" or "-ed" in "walked."\n\nIn summary, morphemes are fundamental building blocks of language, playing a crucial role in word formation and meaning.
