answer: >-
    Active reading techniques are strategies that promote an engaged and purposeful approach to reading, enhancing comprehension and retention of the material. Here are some key active reading techniques and how they improve comprehension:\n\n1. **Previewing**: Before reading, scanning headings, subheadings, and visual elements helps establish a framework for understanding the main ideas and structure of the text. This sets the stage for better comprehension as you read.\n\n2. **Annotating**: Writing notes in the margins, highlighting key points, and underlining important information allows readers to interact with the text actively. This engagement helps reinforce memory and understanding.\n\n3. **Questioning**: Asking questions about the content as you read encourages deeper engagement. Inquiries about the author's purpose, the significance of certain points, or connections to prior knowledge stimulate critical thinking and enhance comprehension.\n\n4. **Summarizing**: After reading sections of the text, summarizing the main ideas in your own words helps consolidate understanding and retention. This practice forces you to process the information actively rather than passively absorbing it.\n\n5. **Reflecting**: Taking time to reflect on what you've read, considering its implications or how it relates to other knowledge, deepens understanding and promotes critical thinking.\n\n6. **Discussion**: Engaging in discussions about the material with peers can further enhance comprehension. Explaining concepts to others or hearing different perspectives can clarify and solidify understanding.\n\nThe benefits of active reading include improved comprehension on both surface and deeper levels, enhanced retention of information, increased reading fluency, and the development of critical thinking skills. By actively engaging with the text, readers are more likely to remember and understand the material, making active reading a powerful tool for academic success.
