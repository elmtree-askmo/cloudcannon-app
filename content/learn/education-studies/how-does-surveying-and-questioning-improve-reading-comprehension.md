    How does surveying and questioning improve reading comprehension?
answer: >-
    Surveying and questioning are integral components of effective reading comprehension strategies, particularly within the framework of the SQ3R method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review). Here's how these two steps specifically enhance reading comprehension:\n\n1. **Surveying**: This initial step involves skimming the text to gain an overview of the material. Readers look at headings, subheadings, graphics, and summary paragraphs. By doing so, they create a mental framework that helps organize and anticipate the information they will encounter. This pre-reading activity primes the reader's cognitive processing, allowing them to identify key themes and concepts. As a result, when they engage with the text in detail, they can better integrate new information with their existing knowledge, which is crucial for comprehension.\n\n2. **Questioning**: After surveying, readers formulate questions based on the headings and subheadings they have identified. This step encourages curiosity and sets a purpose for reading. By actively questioning the material, readers are more likely to engage with the text, seeking answers as they read. This active engagement not only enhances focus and motivation but also promotes deeper understanding. When readers have specific questions in mind, they are more inclined to pay attention to details and make connections, which further aids in comprehension.\n\nIn summary, both surveying and questioning serve to activate prior knowledge, enhance engagement, and provide a structured approach to reading that facilitates better understanding and retention of information. These strategies encourage active reading, which is essential for effective comprehension and memory recall.
