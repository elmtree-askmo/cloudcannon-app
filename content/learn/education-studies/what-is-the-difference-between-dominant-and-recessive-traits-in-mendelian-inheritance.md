    What is the difference between dominant and recessive traits in Mendelian inheritance?
answer: >-
    In Mendelian inheritance, the terms "dominant" and "recessive" refer to the patterns of expression of alleles, which are different forms of a gene. Here are the key differences between dominant and recessive traits:\n\n1. **Expression of Traits**:\n   - **Dominant Traits**: A dominant trait is expressed in the phenotype even if only one copy of the dominant allele is present. This means that an individual can have either two dominant alleles (homozygous dominant) or one dominant and one recessive allele (heterozygous) and still express the dominant trait. For example, if "B" represents a dominant allele for brown eyes, both "BB" and "Bb" genotypes will result in brown eyes.\n   - **Recessive Traits**: A recessive trait is only expressed in the phenotype when two copies of the recessive allele are present (homozygous recessive). Using the previous example, only the genotype "bb" (two recessive alleles) will result in blue eyes.\n\n2. **Masking Effect**:\n   - In a heterozygous condition (where one allele is dominant and the other is recessive), the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele. This means that the phenotype will reflect the dominant trait, while the recessive trait remains unexpressed.\n\n3. **Genotype Representation**:\n   - Dominant alleles are typically represented by uppercase letters (e.g., "B"), while recessive alleles are represented by lowercase letters (e.g., "b"). Therefore, the possible genotypes for a trait can be categorized as:\n     - Homozygous dominant (e.g., "BB")\n     - Heterozygous (e.g., "Bb")\n     - Homozygous recessive (e.g., "bb")\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - Common examples of dominant traits include traits like curly hair, freckles, and brown eyes, while recessive traits may include straight hair, no freckles, and blue eyes.\n\n5. **Inheritance Patterns**:\n   - According to Mendel's laws, when two heterozygous individuals are crossed, the expected phenotypic ratio in the offspring is typically 3:1 for dominant to recessive traits. This means that approximately 75% of the offspring will express the dominant trait, while about 25% will express the recessive trait.\n\nIn summary, dominant traits require only one allele to be expressed, while recessive traits require both alleles to be recessive for expression. This fundamental understanding of dominant and recessive traits is crucial in the study of genetics and inheritance patterns.
