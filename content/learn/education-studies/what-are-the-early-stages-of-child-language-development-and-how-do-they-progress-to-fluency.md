answer: >-
    The early stages of child language development are crucial for understanding how children acquire language and progress towards fluency. These stages can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Pre-linguistic Stage (0-12 months)**: This stage includes the initial vocalizations of infants, such as crying, cooing, and babbling. During this period, children experiment with sounds and begin to connect meaning to gestures and vocal cues. The pre-linguistic stage can be further divided into:\n   - **Crying or Phonation**: Newborns communicate their needs through crying.\n   - **Cooing**: Around 2-3 months, infants produce cooing sounds, which are soft vowel-like sounds.\n   - **Babbling**: By 6-8 months, infants start to babble, producing repetitive consonant-vowel combinations (e.g., "ba-ba" or "da-da").\n\n2. **One-word Stage (Holophrastic Stage) (12-18 months)**: At this stage, children begin to use single words to convey entire ideas or requests. For example, saying "milk" can mean "I want milk." This stage marks the beginning of meaningful speech.\n\n3. **Two-word Stage (18-24 months)**: Children start to combine two words to form simple sentences, such as "want cookie" or "go car." This stage reflects an understanding of basic syntax and the ability to express more complex ideas.\n\n4. **Telegraphic Stage (24-30 months)**: In this stage, children use short sentences that contain only essential content words, omitting less critical words (e.g., "want juice" instead of "I want some juice"). This stage demonstrates a growing understanding of sentence structure.\n\n5. **Later Multi-word Stage (30+ months)**: As children approach the age of three, they begin to form more complex sentences and use a wider range of vocabulary. Their speech becomes more fluent, and they start to grasp grammatical rules, leading to the development of more sophisticated language skills.\n\n6. **Complex Sentence Stage (3+ years)**: Children continue to refine their language skills, using complex sentences and a broader vocabulary. They begin to understand and use grammatical morphemes, such as plurals and past tense, and can engage in more elaborate conversations.\n\nAs children progress through these stages, their fluency increases significantly, often reaching a level comparable to that of adults by the time they enter school (around age 6). This progression is influenced by various factors, including exposure to language, social interactions, and individual cognitive development.\n\nIn summary, the journey from the pre-linguistic stage to fluency involves a series of developmental milestones that reflect increasing complexity in language use, understanding of syntax, and vocabulary expansion. Each stage builds upon the previous one, leading to the rich linguistic capabilities observed in fluent speakers.
