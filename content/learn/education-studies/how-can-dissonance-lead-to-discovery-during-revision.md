    How can dissonance lead to discovery during revision?
answer: >-
    Dissonance can lead to discovery during the revision process by highlighting the incongruities between a writer's intentions and the actual execution of their work. Nancy Sommers identified this dissonance as a core competency of revision, emphasizing that it serves as a catalyst for deeper reflection and growth in writing. When writers encounter dissonance—whether it be in tone, structure, or content—they are prompted to critically assess their work and consider how their original intentions may not align with the final product.\n\nFor student writers, this experience of dissonance can be particularly challenging, often manifesting as fear-based narratives that hinder their confidence and creativity. However, through in-process reflection, students can navigate this dissonance by reframing their fears into productive elements of their writing. This process allows them to adapt and rescript their narratives, transforming dissonance from a source of anxiety into a tool for exploration and innovation.\n\nMoreover, the notion that "good writing disturbs" suggests that dissonance is not merely a hurdle but a valuable aspect of the writing process. It encourages writers to embrace the discomfort that comes with revision, as it can lead to unexpected insights and discoveries about their work. By engaging with dissonance, writers can uncover new layers of meaning, refine their voice, and ultimately enhance the quality of their writing. Thus, dissonance plays a crucial role in fostering a holistic and recursive revision process, where writers continuously learn and evolve through their experiences.
