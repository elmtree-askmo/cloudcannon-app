    How are the months of the year pronounced in Spanish?
answer: >-
    The months of the year in Spanish are pronounced as follows:\n\n1. **Enero** (January) - pronounced as "eh-neh-ro"\n2. **Febrero** (February) - pronounced as "feh-bre-ro"\n3. **Marzo** (March) - pronounced as "mar-so"\n4. **Abril** (April) - pronounced as "ah-bril"\n5. **Mayo** (May) - pronounced as "mah-yo"\n6. **Junio** (June) - pronounced as "hoo-nee-o"\n7. **Julio** (July) - pronounced as "hoo-lee-o"\n8. **Agosto** (August) - pronounced as "ah-gos-to"\n9. **Septiembre** (September) - pronounced as "sep-tiem-bre"\n10. **Octubre** (October) - pronounced as "ok-tu-bre"\n11. **Noviembre** (November) - pronounced as "noh-vee-em-bre"\n12. **Diciembre** (December) - pronounced as "dee-ciem-bre"\n\nIt's important to note that in Spanish, the names of the months are not capitalized, unlike in English. Additionally, Spanish is a phonetic language, meaning that the pronunciation closely follows the spelling. While there may be slight regional variations in pronunciation across different Spanish-speaking countries, the above pronunciations are generally accepted.
