    How many consonants are there in the French alphabet?
answer: >-
    In the French alphabet, there are 20 consonants. The consonants are defined as letters that do not represent vowel sounds, and they can be classified based on their sonority (sonores or sourdes) and their mode of articulation (such as occlusives or fricatives). \n\nThe complete French alphabet consists of 26 letters, which includes these 20 consonants and 6 vowels. Understanding the distinction between consonants and vowels is fundamental to the study of phonetics and the structure of the French language.
