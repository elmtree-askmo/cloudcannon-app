    What is the format of the reading comprehension section in the exam?
answer: >-
    The reading comprehension section of the Latin exam varies depending on the level of the exam being taken. Here are the key formats for different levels:\n\n1. **AP Latin Exam**: This section consists of 50 multiple-choice questions that must be completed in one hour, accounting for 50% of the total exam score. The questions are based on syllabus readings from authors such as Vergil and Caesar, as well as sight readings from poetry and prose. Students are required to demonstrate their knowledge of Latin vocabulary, syntax, and comprehension of the passages.\n\n2. **Intermediate and Advanced Latin Reading Comprehension Exams**: These exams are based entirely on passages in Latin. The Advanced Latin Reading Comprehension Exam includes two authentic Latin passages—one prose and one poetry—serving as the basis for questions on grammar and comprehension.\n\n3. **Beginning Latin Reading Comprehension Exam**: This exam features 36 questions, allowing students sufficient time to read and understand two crafted Latin passages appropriate for their level. It also includes a few questions about language and culture in the context of the passages.\n\n4. **National Latin Exam**: This is a forty-question, multiple-choice test with a time limit of forty-five minutes, offered at seven different levels. The format emphasizes comprehension of Latin rather than the production of forms.\n\nOverall, the reading comprehension sections across these exams are designed to assess students' understanding of Latin texts, their ability to analyze and interpret passages, and their knowledge of relevant vocabulary and grammar.
