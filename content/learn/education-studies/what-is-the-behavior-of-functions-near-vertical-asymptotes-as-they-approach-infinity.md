    What is the behavior of functions near vertical asymptotes as they approach infinity?
answer: >-
    The behavior of functions near vertical asymptotes is a crucial aspect of understanding limits and discontinuities in calculus. Vertical asymptotes occur at specific values of $ x $ where a function approaches infinity or negative infinity. This typically happens when the denominator of a rational function approaches zero while the numerator remains non-zero.\n\n### Behavior Near Vertical Asymptotes\n\n1. **Approaching Infinity**: As a function approaches a vertical asymptote from the left (denoted as the left-hand limit), the function's values may increase or decrease without bound. For example, consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \):\n   - As $ x $ approaches 0 from the left ($ x \to 0^- $), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).\n   - As $ x $ approaches 0 from the right ($ x \to 0^+ $), \( f(x) \to +\infty \).\n\n2. **Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits**: It is essential to evaluate the left-hand limit and right-hand limit separately when analyzing the behavior of functions near vertical asymptotes:\n   - **Left-Hand Limit**: \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \)\n   - **Right-Hand Limit**: \( \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \)\n   If these limits approach $ +\infty $ or $ -\infty $, it indicates the presence of a vertical asymptote at $ x = a $.\n\n3. **Discontinuity**: The presence of a vertical asymptote signifies a discontinuity in the function at that point. The function does not have a defined value at the asymptote, and the limits indicate the behavior as the function approaches that point.\n\n4. **Graphical Analysis**: Graphically, vertical asymptotes are represented as dashed lines that the graph approaches but never intersects. The function's graph will typically show steep increases or decreases as it nears the asymptote.\n\n### Example of a Rational Function\n\nConsider the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \):\n- This function has vertical asymptotes at $ x = 1 $ and $ x = -1 $.\n- As $ x $ approaches 1 from the left, \( f(x) \to +\infty \) (left-hand limit).\n- As $ x $ approaches 1 from the right, \( f(x) \to +\infty \) (right-hand limit).\n- Similarly, as $ x $ approaches -1 from either side, \( f(x) \to +\infty \).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the behavior of functions near vertical asymptotes is characterized by the function approaching infinity or negative infinity as it nears the asymptote. Understanding this behavior is essential for analyzing rational functions and their limits, as well as for identifying discontinuities in the function.
