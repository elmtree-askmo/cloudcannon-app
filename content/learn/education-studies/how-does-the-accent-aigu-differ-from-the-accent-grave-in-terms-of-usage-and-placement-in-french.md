    How does the accent aigu differ from the accent grave in terms of usage and placement in French?
answer: >-
    The accent aigu (´) and the accent grave (`) are two important diacritical marks in the French language, each serving distinct purposes and having specific placements.\n\n### Accent Aigu (´)\n1. **Placement**: The accent aigu is exclusively used on the letter 'e', resulting in the character 'é'.\n2. **Pronunciation**: It indicates a pronunciation that sounds like "ay," as in the English word "day." For example, in the word "été" (summer), the 'é' is pronounced with this sound.\n3. **Historical Context**: The accent aigu can also signify that an 's' used to follow the vowel in older forms of French. For instance, "étudiant" (student) reflects this historical spelling.\n4. **Usage**: It is primarily used to denote the specific pronunciation of 'e' and does not appear on any other vowels.\n\n### Accent Grave (`) \n1. **Placement**: The accent grave can be placed over the letters 'a', 'e', and 'u', resulting in 'à', 'è', and 'ù'.\n2. **Pronunciation**: \n   - On 'e' (è), it indicates a pronunciation that sounds like "eh," as in "crème."\n   - On 'a' (à) and 'u' (ù), it serves to distinguish between homographs, such as "a" (has) and "à" (to), or "ou" (or) and "où" (where).\n3. **Functionality**: The accent grave on 'e' changes the vowel sound, while on 'a' and 'u', it helps clarify meaning in written French.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Vowels Used**: The accent aigu is only used on 'e', while the accent grave can be used on 'a', 'e', and 'u'.\n- **Pronunciation**: The accent aigu produces an "ay" sound, while the accent grave on 'e' produces an "eh" sound. The accents on 'a' and 'u' do not change their sounds but serve to differentiate meanings.\n- **Homographs**: The accent grave is particularly useful for distinguishing between words that would otherwise be homographs.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for proper pronunciation and spelling in French, as incorrect usage can lead to misunderstandings in both spoken and written communication.
