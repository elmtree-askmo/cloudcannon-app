    What is the ICF Core Competency on Agreements?
answer: >-
    The ICF Core Competency on Agreements, specifically referred to as "Establishing and Maintaining Agreements," is a fundamental aspect of the coaching process as defined by the International Coach Federation (ICF). This competency emphasizes the importance of creating clear agreements between the coach and the client regarding the coaching relationship, process, plans, and goals.\n\n### Definition and Importance\nThe competency involves partnering with the client and relevant stakeholders to establish clear agreements that outline the expectations, roles, and responsibilities of both parties. This is crucial for building trust and credibility, as it sets the foundation for a productive coaching relationship. A well-defined coaching agreement serves as a reference point throughout the coaching engagement, ensuring that both the coach and the client remain aligned and focused on their shared goals.\n\n### Components of Coaching Agreements\nA comprehensive coaching agreement typically includes several key components:\n- **Goals and Objectives**: Clearly defined goals that the client aims to achieve through coaching.\n- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Specification of what is expected from both the coach and the client.\n- **Boundaries**: Guidelines on the nature of the coaching relationship, including confidentiality and ethical considerations.\n- **Session Logistics**: Details about the frequency, duration, and format of coaching sessions.\n- **Feedback and Evaluation**: Processes for assessing progress and making necessary adjustments to the coaching plan.\n\n### Practical Application\nIn practice, establishing a coaching agreement involves discussions at the beginning of the coaching relationship and may include periodic reviews to ensure that the agreement remains relevant and effective. For example, a coach might ask the client questions such as, "What would you like to focus on today, and how will you know that it has been a successful conversation for you?" This helps clarify the client's immediate goals and aligns the session's focus with their broader objectives.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the ICF Core Competency on Agreements is essential for fostering a successful coaching relationship. By ensuring that both the coach and the client have a mutual understanding of their roles and expectations, the coaching process can be more effective and goal-oriented.
