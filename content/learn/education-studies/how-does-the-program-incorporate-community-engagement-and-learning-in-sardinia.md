    How does the program incorporate community engagement and learning in Sardinia?
answer: >-
    The study abroad program in Sardinia incorporates community engagement and learning through a variety of initiatives that focus on the health and human rights of migrant and marginalized populations. One notable aspect of the program is its cross-disciplinary approach, which allows students to work directly with local communities, particularly in Alghero, a city recognized for its positive migrant inclusion policies.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to engage with individuals seeking asylum in Sardinia, providing them with hands-on experience in understanding the challenges faced by these populations. This engagement is facilitated by faculty members, such as Associate Professor Jody Early, who lead groups of students in collaborative projects aimed at addressing social issues within the community.\n\nAdditionally, the program emphasizes cultural immersion, allowing students to participate in local events and activities curated by a Community Manager. This role helps students connect with the local culture and community, providing insights into Sardinian life that go beyond traditional classroom learning.\n\nOverall, the program not only enhances academic knowledge but also fosters a sense of responsibility and awareness regarding social justice issues, making it a comprehensive learning experience that benefits both students and the local community.
