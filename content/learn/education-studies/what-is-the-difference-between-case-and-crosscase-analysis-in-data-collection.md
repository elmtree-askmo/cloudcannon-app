    What is the difference between case and cross-case analysis in data collection?
answer: >-
    In the context of qualitative research, particularly case studies, the terms "case analysis" and "cross-case analysis" refer to different approaches to analyzing data collected from one or more cases.\n\n1. **Case Analysis**: This approach focuses on examining a single case in depth. The researcher analyzes the data within that specific case to understand its unique characteristics, dynamics, and context. This method allows for a detailed exploration of the case's complexities and nuances, leading to rich, contextual insights.\n\n2. **Cross-Case Analysis**: In contrast, cross-case analysis involves comparing multiple cases to identify similarities and differences across them. This method is particularly useful in multiple case study research, where the researcher examines several cases to draw broader conclusions. By systematically comparing the findings from each case, researchers can uncover patterns, themes, and mechanisms that may not be evident when looking at a single case alone. This approach enhances the ability to generalize findings and contributes to theoretical conclusions (Vaughan 1992: 178).\n\nThe primary difference lies in the scope of analysis: case analysis is focused on individual cases, while cross-case analysis synthesizes insights from multiple cases to provide a comparative perspective. This comparative analysis can reveal how different contexts influence outcomes and can help in understanding broader trends or theories within the field of study. \n\nIn summary, while case analysis provides depth, cross-case analysis offers breadth, allowing researchers to explore the relationships and dynamics between different cases.
