    What has been the government's response to the NEET-UG Exam Controversy?
answer: >-
    In response to the NEET-UG Exam Controversy, the Central government has taken several steps to address the allegations surrounding the examination. The controversy arose from an alleged paper leak during the NEET-UG exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on May 5, 2024, and concerns regarding the "inflation of marks" awarded to 1,563 students.\n\n1. **Supreme Court Involvement**: The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the NTA and the Central government regarding the alleged paper leaks and malpractices. This legal scrutiny follows significant public outcry from parents and educators about the grace marks awarded to certain candidates.\n\n2. **Government's Stance**: The Central government informed the Supreme Court that there is no justification for re-conducting the NEET-UG 2024 exam, citing the absence of significant irregularities and the potential harm to legitimate candidates.\n\n3. **Formation of Committees**: In light of the allegations, the NTA has formed a four-member committee to investigate the claims made against the conduct of the NEET exam. The recommendations from this committee are expected to guide future actions and reforms.\n\n4. **Transparency Measures**: To enhance transparency, the NTA has released a comprehensive set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) addressing key concerns related to the exam and the ongoing controversy.\n\n5. **Ministerial Promises**: Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has promised stringent action against any NTA officials found guilty of misconduct related to the exam.\n\n6. **Public and Political Response**: The controversy has also drawn attention from opposition parties, with calls for a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the allegations of paper leaks and corruption.\n\nOverall, the government's response has involved legal, administrative, and transparency measures aimed at addressing the concerns raised by the NEET-UG controversy while maintaining the integrity of the examination process.
