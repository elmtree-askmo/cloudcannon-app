    What are the base units of mass, length, and volume in the metric system?
answer: >-
    In the metric system, the base units for mass, length, and volume are as follows:\n\n- **Mass:** The base unit of mass is the **kilogram (kg)**. It is defined as the mass of a specific platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\n- **Length:** The base unit of length is the **meter (m)**. The meter is defined based on the distance light travels in a vacuum in a specific fraction of a second.\n\n- **Volume:** The base unit of volume is the **liter (L)**. One liter is equivalent to one cubic decimeter (1 L = 1 dmÂ³), which is the volume of a cube that measures 10 centimeters on each side.\n\nThese units are part of a decimal-based system, which allows for easy conversion between different scales using prefixes such as milli- (1/1000), centi- (1/100), and kilo- (1000). For example, 1 kilometer (km) equals 1,000 meters (m), and 1 liter (L) equals 1,000 milliliters (mL).
