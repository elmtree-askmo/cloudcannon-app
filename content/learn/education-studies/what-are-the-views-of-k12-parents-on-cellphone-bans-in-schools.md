    What are the views of K-12 parents on cellphone bans in schools?
answer: >-
    The views of K-12 parents on cellphone bans in schools are generally supportive, with a significant majority favoring restrictions on cellphone use during class. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 65% of K-12 parents support a ban on cellphone use in classrooms, while 36% believe that these devices should be prohibited for the entire school day. This reflects a broader trend among U.S. adults, where 68% support classroom bans but are less inclined to endorse all-day restrictions.\n\nAmong those who support classroom bans, a notable reason cited by 44% of K-12 parents is the belief that such measures would help reduce bullying in schools. This concern is particularly relevant in light of rising issues related to cyberbullying and inappropriate content that can be facilitated by cellphone use. In contrast, 41% of parents who oppose cellphone bans argue that decisions regarding cellphone use should be left to parents rather than schools.\n\nThe National Parents Union also highlights that parents are increasingly concerned about the potential harms of cellphone use, including exposure to inappropriate content, online predators, and cyberbullying. This concern has been amplified by recent events, such as school shootings, which have reignited debates about the role of cellphones in schools.\n\nOverall, while there is a strong inclination among K-12 parents to support cellphone bans in classrooms, opinions vary regarding the extent of these restrictions and the role of parents in managing their children's cellphone use.
