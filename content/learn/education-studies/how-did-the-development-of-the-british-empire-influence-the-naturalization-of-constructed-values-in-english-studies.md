    How did the development of the British Empire influence the naturalization of constructed values in English studies?
answer: >-
    The development of the British Empire had a profound influence on the naturalization of constructed values in English studies, particularly through the institutionalization of English as an academic discipline in the 19th century. This period marked a significant shift in educational priorities, where English literature and language began to replace classical studies, such as Greek and Latin, at the center of the curriculum. This transition was not merely an academic change; it was deeply intertwined with the colonial context in which English was viewed as a vehicle for promoting British values and culture.\n\nAs the British Empire expanded, English became a tool for cultural imperialism, facilitating the spread of constructed values such as "civilization" and "humanity." These values were often positioned in opposition to notions of "savagery" and "primitivism," which were ascribed to colonized peoples. The syllabuses of prestigious institutions like Oxford and Cambridge played a crucial role in this process, as they prioritized English literature and its associated values, effectively sidelining the contributions and perspectives of post-colonial authors.\n\nThe Newbolt Report of 1921, which advocated for the teaching of English language and literature, further exemplified this trend. It emphasized the importance of English as a means of liberal education, which, in practice, often served to reinforce the ideological underpinnings of colonialism. British colonial administrators recognized English literature as an ally in their efforts to control colonized populations, promoting a narrative that framed English as a superior cultural norm.\n\nThis valorization of English literature led to the marginalization of "peripheral" voices and texts, creating a curriculum that was Eurocentric and often dismissive of the rich literary traditions emerging from formerly colonized nations. Scholars like Ngugi Wa Thiong’o have critiqued this framework, calling for a re-evaluation of English studies that acknowledges and incorporates diverse literary voices and experiences.\n\nIn summary, the British Empire's expansion significantly shaped the naturalization of constructed values in English studies by promoting English as a central cultural and educational force, while simultaneously marginalizing the voices of those from colonized backgrounds. This legacy continues to prompt critical discussions about the inclusivity and relevance of English studies in contemporary academia.
