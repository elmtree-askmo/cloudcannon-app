answer: >-
    Art criticism underwent significant evolution in the 19th century, playing a crucial role in shaping public perception of art and influencing the broader cultural landscape. This period marked a transition from traditional forms of critique to a more engaged and socially aware approach, reflecting the complexities of contemporary life.\n\n1. **Emergence of Influential Critics**: Prominent figures such as John Ruskin and Charles Baudelaire emerged as key critics during this time. They shifted the focus of art criticism from mere aesthetic evaluation to a deeper examination of how art reflected societal issues. Ruskin, for instance, emphasized the importance of realism in art, arguing that artists should depict the realities of life, including poverty and class struggles. This perspective positioned art as a powerful tool for societal discourse, highlighting the role of the artist as a commentator on social conditions.\n\n2. **Art as Social Commentary**: The 19th century was characterized by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and modernization, which influenced both the themes of artworks and the critiques surrounding them. Critics began to view art not just as an object of beauty but as a medium for social change. This shift allowed art criticism to engage with pressing social issues, such as class disparity and gender roles, thereby fostering a dialogue between artists and the public.\n\n3. **Institutional Influence**: The establishment of art institutions and exhibitions, such as the Salon in Paris, provided a platform for critics to voice their opinions and shape public taste. The Salon of the Refused and the Salon of Independents, for example, challenged traditional norms and showcased avant-garde movements, allowing critics to advocate for new artistic expressions. This environment encouraged a more dynamic interaction between critics, artists, and the audience, further influencing public perception.\n\n4. **Critical Discourse and Public Engagement**: Art criticism became a vital part of cultural discourse, influencing trends and shaping public opinion. Critics not only evaluated artworks but also engaged with the public through writings and lectures, making art more accessible and relevant to everyday life. This engagement helped demystify art, allowing a broader audience to participate in discussions about its meaning and significance.\n\n5. **Evolution of Critique Methods**: The methods of critique evolved from personal accounts to more structured analyses that incorporated theoretical perspectives. Critics began to interpret artworks within the context of art history and contemporary social issues, contributing to the development of art history as a discipline. This evolution also reflected a growing awareness of the importance of context in understanding art.\n\nIn summary, art criticism in the 19th century evolved from a focus on aesthetic evaluation to a more nuanced engagement with social issues, significantly shaping public perception of art. Critics played a pivotal role in fostering dialogue between artists and the public, influencing trends, and advocating for new artistic movements. This period laid the groundwork for modern art criticism, emphasizing the importance of art as a reflection of societal values and concerns.
