    What are the types of nitrogenous bases and how do they pair in nucleic acids?
answer: >-
    Nitrogenous bases are essential components of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. These bases are categorized into two main groups: purines and pyrimidines.\n\n### Categories of Nitrogenous Bases\n\n1. **Purines**: These bases have a double-ring structure. The purines in nucleic acids are:\n   - **Adenine (A)**\n   - **Guanine (G)**\n\n2. **Pyrimidines**: These bases have a single-ring structure. The pyrimidines in nucleic acids are:\n   - **Cytosine (C)**\n   - **Thymine (T)** (found only in DNA)\n   - **Uracil (U)** (found only in RNA, replacing thymine)\n\n### Base Pairing Specifics\n\nThe pairing of nitrogenous bases is crucial for the structure and function of DNA and RNA. The specific base pairing rules are as follows:\n\n- In **DNA**:\n  - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds.\n  - Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) through three hydrogen bonds.\n\n- In **RNA**:\n  - Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) instead of thymine.\n  - Guanine (G) still pairs with Cytosine (C).\n\n### Summary of Base Pairing Rules\n\n- **DNA Base Pairing**:\n  - A pairs with T\n  - G pairs with C\n\n- **RNA Base Pairing**:\n  - A pairs with U\n  - G pairs with C\n\nThese base pairing rules are fundamental for DNA replication and transcription, ensuring that genetic information is accurately copied and expressed. The stability of the DNA double helix and the proper functioning of RNA are both reliant on these specific pairings.
