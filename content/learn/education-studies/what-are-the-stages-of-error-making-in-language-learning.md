    What are the stages of error making in language learning?
answer: >-
    The stages of error making in language learning can be understood through various frameworks that highlight how learners progress and the types of errors they typically make. Based on the gathered information, we can outline the following stages:\n\n1. **Overproduction Stage**: In the early stages of language learning, learners often exhibit overproduction of language forms. This occurs because they have not yet fully acquired the rules of the target language (TL) and tend to produce more language than they can accurately control. This stage is characterized by frequent errors as learners experiment with language structures.\n\n2. **Learning Stage**: According to Gatbonton (1983), this stage involves the initial acquisition of language rules. Learners begin to recognize and apply some correct forms while still retaining incorrect ones. This stage is marked by a mix of correct and incorrect usage as learners start to internalize the language.\n\n3. **Extirpation Stage**: Following the learning stage, learners enter a phase where they work to eliminate incorrect forms from their language use. This involves recognizing errors and gradually replacing them with correct forms. The process of extirpation is essential for refining language skills and achieving greater accuracy.\n\n4. **Development Errors**: As learners progress, they may encounter developmental errors, which are often the result of overgeneralization of rules. For example, a learner might incorrectly apply regular verb conjugation rules to irregular verbs (e.g., saying "breaked" instead of "broke"). These errors indicate that the learner is beginning to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the language.\n\n5. **Systematic Errors**: These errors are consistent and reflect a learner's developing language system. They are not random mistakes but rather indicate a systematic misunderstanding of language rules. For instance, a learner might consistently misuse prepositions due to interference from their native language (interlingual errors).\n\n6. **Unsystematic Errors**: These are occasional mistakes that do not reflect a learner's overall understanding of the language. Corder refers to these as "mistakes" rather than "errors," as they are not indicative of a systematic issue in the learner's language development.\n\n7. **Feedback and Correction**: Throughout these stages, feedback from teachers and peers plays a crucial role in helping learners identify and correct their errors. Effective error correction strategies can guide learners towards greater linguistic competence and confidence.\n\nIn summary, the stages of error making in language learning reflect a progression from overproduction and systematic errors to more refined language use as learners internalize rules and receive corrective feedback. Understanding these stages can help educators tailor their teaching strategies to support learners effectively.
