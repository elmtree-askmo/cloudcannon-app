    How does the 'middle-class squeeze' manifest in college admissions?
answer: >-
    The "middle-class squeeze" in college admissions refers to the challenges faced by middle-class families in securing spots for their children at elite colleges and universities. This phenomenon is characterized by a significant underrepresentation of middle-class students—those from families in the middle 60 percent of income—at these institutions, often referred to as the "missing middle."\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this squeeze:\n\n1. **Declining Representation**: Over the past two decades, the share of middle-class students attending elite colleges has decreased. Reports indicate that students from middle-income families are enrolling at Ivy-plus colleges at rates significantly lower than the average, with only about 4.4 to 4.7 percent of these students gaining admission.\n\n2. **Economic Disparities**: As colleges increasingly enroll more low-income and high-income students, middle-income students are being displaced. This trend raises concerns about a "hollowing of the middle class" in higher education, where the admissions landscape favors those at the extremes of the economic spectrum.\n\n3. **Financial Aid Dynamics**: Middle-class families often face unique financial challenges. While they may not qualify for substantial need-based financial aid, they also struggle to afford the rising costs of college. In contrast, low-income students may receive significant financial support, while high-income families can afford tuition without financial aid. This creates a situation where middle-class students find themselves at a disadvantage, as they do not receive the same level of financial assistance as their lower-income peers, nor do they have the financial flexibility of wealthier families.\n\n4. **Implicit Subsidies**: For families with middle to high incomes, ownership of uncounted assets can provide an implicit subsidy for college attendance through additional grant-based financial aid. However, this aid is often distributed inequitably, with white students receiving more support than Black students with similar family incomes, further complicating the landscape for middle-class applicants.\n\nIn summary, the middle-class squeeze in college admissions manifests through declining representation of middle-class students, economic disparities in financial aid, and the challenges posed by rising college costs. This situation highlights the need for more equitable admissions practices that consider the unique circumstances of middle-class families.
