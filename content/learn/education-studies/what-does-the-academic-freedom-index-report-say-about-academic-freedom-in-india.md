    What does the Academic Freedom Index Report say about academic freedom in India?
answer: >-
    The Academic Freedom Index Report 2023 highlights significant concerns regarding academic freedom in India. According to the report, India ranks in the bottom 30% of 179 countries assessed, with a score of 0.38 on a scale from 0 (low) to 1 (high). This score is notably lower than that of Pakistan, which scored 0.43, and the United States, which scored 0.79.\n\nThe report indicates a dramatic decline in India's academic freedom over the past decade, with the score dropping from 0.6 points in 2013 to 0.2 points in 2023. This decline categorizes India as "completely restricted," marking its lowest score since the mid-1940s. The report suggests that this deterioration in academic freedom is linked to a broader trend of autocratisation in the country, with increased political control and the imposition of a majoritarian religious agenda in educational institutions being cited as primary threats.\n\nKey highlights from the report include:\n- A significant decline in academic freedom, with India's score reflecting a retreat in academic rights and freedoms.\n- The report emphasizes that over 50% of the world's population is experiencing a retreat in academic freedom, with India being a notable example.\n- The challenges faced by higher education institutions in India include issues related to campus integrity, institutional autonomy, and the freedom of academic and cultural expression.\n\nOverall, the Academic Freedom Index Report underscores the pressing need for reforms to protect and promote academic freedom in India, as the current environment poses serious challenges to scholars and researchers in their pursuit of knowledge and expression.
