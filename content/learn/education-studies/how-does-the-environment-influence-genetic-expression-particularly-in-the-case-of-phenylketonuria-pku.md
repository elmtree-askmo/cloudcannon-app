    How does the environment influence genetic expression, particularly in the case of Phenylketonuria (PKU)?
answer: >-
    The environment significantly influences genetic expression, particularly in the case of Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can result in severe neurological issues if not managed properly.\n\nOne of the primary environmental factors affecting the phenotype of individuals with PKU is diet. A strict diet low in phenylalanine is essential for managing the condition. If individuals with PKU consume foods high in phenylalanine, such as meat, dairy products, and certain grains, they risk developing intellectual disabilities and other neurological complications. Conversely, adhering to a low-phenylalanine diet can significantly mitigate these risks and lead to a more typical phenotype in terms of cognitive and physical development.\n\nAdditionally, the timing of dietary intervention is crucial. Early diagnosis and dietary management can lead to better outcomes, as the brain is particularly sensitive to elevated levels of phenylalanine during critical periods of development. Therefore, the environmental influence of diet is not only about the types of food consumed but also about when these dietary changes are implemented.\n\nIn summary, the phenotype of individuals with phenylketonuria is heavily influenced by environmental factors, particularly dietary choices. Proper management through a low-phenylalanine diet can prevent the adverse effects associated with the disorder, highlighting the interplay between genetics and environment in determining phenotype. This case exemplifies how environmental factors can modulate genetic expression and ultimately affect health outcomes.
