    How should online sources be cited in MLA format?
answer: >-
    To cite online sources in MLA format, you should follow the guidelines set forth in the 9th edition of the MLA Handbook. Here’s a general structure for creating a Works Cited entry for a webpage:\n\n1. **Author's Name**: Start with the author's last name, followed by the first name.\n2. **Title of the Page**: Include the title of the specific page in quotation marks.\n3. **Title of the Website**: Italicize the name of the website.\n4. **Publisher**: If applicable, include the name of the publisher.\n5. **Publication Date**: Provide the date the page was published or last updated.\n6. **URL**: Include the full URL of the page.\n7. **Date of Access**: Although optional, it is recommended to include the date you accessed the page if the publication date is unavailable.\n\nHere’s an example of how to format a citation for a webpage:\n\n```\nAuthor Last Name, First Name. "Title of the Page." *Title of the Website*, Publisher, Publication Date, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.\n```\n\n### Example:\nSmith, John. "Understanding Climate Change." *Environmental Studies Online*, Green Publishing, 15 Mar. 2021, www.environmentalstudiesonline.com/climate-change. Accessed 10 Oct. 2023.\n\n### In-Text Citations:\nFor in-text citations, you typically include the author's last name and the page number (if applicable) in parentheses. If the source does not have page numbers, you can simply use the author's last name.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If the author is the same as the website name, you can start the citation with the title of the page instead.\n- Always check with your instructor or editor regarding the inclusion of URLs, as it may vary by preference.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your citations are formatted correctly in MLA style.
