answer: >-
    Rapid Serial Visual Processing (RSVP) is often ineffective for comprehension due to several key limitations related to cognitive processing and working memory constraints.\n\n1. **Working Memory Overload**: RSVP involves displaying words one at a time in a fixed location, which eliminates the natural eye movements (saccades) that skilled readers use to navigate text. This method can overwhelm working memory because it requires the brain to hold onto multiple words and their meanings without the ability to glance back at previous words or phrases. As a result, readers may struggle to retain the information being presented, leading to decreased comprehension.\n\n2. **Inability to Skip Function Words**: In traditional reading, skilled readers can skip over less critical function words (like "the," "and," etc.) and focus on content words that carry more meaning. RSVP does not allow for this natural reading strategy, forcing the brain to process every word in sequence, which can hinder the ability to grasp the overall meaning of the text.\n\n3. **Lack of Regressions**: Readers often need to go back and re-read sections of text to clarify understanding or to make connections between ideas. RSVP does not permit this regression, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed information, particularly in complex texts that require inference and deeper analysis.\n\n4. **Elimination of Subvocalization**: Subvocalization, or the inner voice that many readers use to "speak" the words in their minds, plays a crucial role in comprehension. Research by Elizabeth Schotter indicates that attempts to eliminate this inner speech can impair comprehension, especially when dealing with challenging texts that require inference. RSVP's rapid presentation of words discourages this natural subvocalization process, further complicating comprehension.\n\nIn summary, while RSVP aims to streamline reading by removing the need for eye movements, it inadvertently creates challenges that can hinder comprehension. The inability to manage working memory effectively, skip less critical words, revisit previous content, and utilize subvocalization all contribute to the ineffectiveness of this technique for understanding complex texts.
