    What kind of public and government support was provided for the Paralympics?
answer: >-
    The support provided for Paralympic athletes in India has significantly contributed to the country's success in recent Paralympic Games. Here are the key aspects of public and government support:\n\n1. **Government Schemes**: All 84 athletes representing India at the Paralympics were backed by various government schemes. Notably, the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provided special support to medal hopefuls, while the Khelo India program aimed at nurturing sports talent at the grassroots level.\n\n2. **International Exposure**: Athletes received international exposure primarily through competitions abroad, which helped them gain valuable experience and improve their performance.\n\n3. **Expert Guidance**: The athletes were guided by international experts, enhancing their training and preparation for the Games.\n\n4. **Funding and Resources**: The Paralympic Committee of India (PCI), recognized by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, received funding from the government to conduct national coaching camps, foreign exposures, and national championships. This funding also included grants for purchasing equipment necessary for training and competition.\n\n5. **Support for Specific Athletes**: A significant portion of the athletes, specifically 50 out of 84 participants in the Paris Paralympics, were supported through the TOPS. Others benefited from the Khelo India program and National Centres of Excellence (NCOE).\n\n6. **Corporate and NGO Support**: In addition to government support, the PCI also received funding from private organizations and NGOs, which played a crucial role in promoting and developing Paralympic sports in India.\n\n7. **Commitment to Future Success**: The government has expressed its commitment to continue supporting Paralympians with facilities and funding, aiming for even greater achievements in future events, including the 2024 and 2028 Paralympics.\n\nThis comprehensive support system has been instrumental in empowering Indian para-athletes, leading to a historic performance, including a record 19 medals at the Tokyo Paralympics.
