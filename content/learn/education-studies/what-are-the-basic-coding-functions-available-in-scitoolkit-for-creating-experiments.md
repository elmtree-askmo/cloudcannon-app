    What are the basic coding functions available in SciToolkit for creating experiments?
answer: >-
    The basic coding functions available in SciToolkit, particularly in the context of PsyToolkit for creating experiments, include several key components that facilitate the design and execution of psychological studies. Here are some of the essential functions and features:\n\n1. **Scripting Language**: PsyToolkit uses a specific scripting language that allows users to write code for their experiments. This includes defining the structure of the experiment, specifying stimuli, and collecting responses.\n\n2. **Stimulus Presentation**: You can create and present various types of stimuli, such as:\n   - **Bitmaps**: Images that can be displayed during the experiment.\n   - **Shapes**: Basic geometric shapes like rectangles and circles.\n   - **Text**: Displaying text on the screen for instructions or questions.\n\n3. **Variables**: You can define variables to hold values that can change during the experiment. For example, you might create a variable to track the time since the start of the experiment or to store participant responses.\n\n4. **Configuration Files**: Each experiment can have a configuration file that specifies meta-options and settings for the experiment. This file is processed by the `run_experiment` command.\n\n5. **Participant Feedback**: The scripting language allows you to program feedback for participants based on their responses, enhancing the interactivity of the experiment.\n\n6. **Data Collection**: PsyToolkit provides functions to collect and store data from participants, which can be analyzed later.\n\n7. **Online Questionnaires**: In addition to experiments, PsyToolkit can be used to create online questionnaires, allowing for a broader range of data collection methods.\n\n8. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Comprehensive documentation is available, including tutorials that guide users through the process of setting up experiments, designing stimuli, and analyzing data.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples, you can refer to the official PsyToolkit documentation at [PsyToolkit Documentation](https://us.psytoolkit.org/doc3.4.6/syntax.html).\n\nThese functions collectively enable researchers to design, implement, and analyze experiments effectively using SciToolkit.
