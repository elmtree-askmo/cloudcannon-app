    How is neatness and clarity emphasized in the examination guidelines?
answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information does not specifically address the examination guidelines related to neatness and clarity in the Fiji Year 8 Examination. There are mentions of the examination's purpose and the number of students participating, but no details on the emphasis placed on neatness and clarity in the examination guidelines.
