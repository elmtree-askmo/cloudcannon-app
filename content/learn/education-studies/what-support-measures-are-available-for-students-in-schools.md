    What support measures are available for students in schools?
answer: >-
    In schools, various support measures are available to assist students, particularly those with special educational needs or non-Chinese speaking backgrounds. Here are some key support measures:\n\n1. **Parental Involvement**: Schools encourage parents to participate in interest classes organized by the Parent-Teacher Association. This involvement can help foster a supportive community around the students.\n\n2. **Tailored Support for Non-Chinese Speaking Students**: Schools adjust their support measures each academic year based on the learning situations and needs of non-Chinese speaking students. This includes providing information to parents regarding school selection, further education, and employment opportunities for their children.\n\n3. **Evidence-Based Strategies**: Many support measures and strategies implemented in schools are based on research evidence. For instance, schools may develop Individualized Learning Plans (ILPs) for students with autism, which have shown effectiveness in guiding their educational journey.\n\n4. **Wide Range of Support Services**: Schools offer a variety of support services that cater to students with physical and mental disabilities, as well as general education teachers. This includes educational aids, appropriate teaching materials, and assistance for learning and daily living.\n\n5. **Crisis Intervention**: In the event of a crisis, schools provide immediate intervention and follow-up services to ensure the well-being of students.\n\n6. **Professional Referrals**: For students requiring further support, schools can provide appropriate referrals to external professional services.\n\n7. **Continuous Development and Review**: Schools are encouraged to regularly review and assess the effectiveness of their student support services, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of their students.\n\n8. **After-School Support Programs**: Initiatives like the "After-School Assistance Program" aim to provide additional learning support during non-class hours, helping to bridge learning gaps.\n\n9. **Differentiated Instruction**: Schools are supported in implementing differentiated teaching strategies to cater to individual learning needs, thereby enhancing student motivation and learning outcomes.\n\nThese measures reflect a comprehensive approach to student support, aiming to create an inclusive and effective learning environment for all students.
