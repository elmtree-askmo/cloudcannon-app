    What is the role of 'either…or' in creating parallel structures?
answer: >-
    The role of 'either…or' in creating parallel structures is significant as it serves as a correlative conjunction that connects two equal parts of a sentence, thereby establishing a balanced and coherent relationship between the ideas presented. When using 'either…or', it is essential to ensure that the elements following each part of the conjunction maintain the same grammatical structure. This adherence to parallelism enhances clarity and readability in writing.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence: "Either he will go to the party, or he will stay home." Here, both clauses ("he will go to the party" and "he will stay home") are structured similarly, which reinforces the connection between the two choices being presented. This parallel structure not only makes the sentence easier to understand but also emphasizes the equal importance of the options.\n\nIn summary, 'either…or' plays a crucial role in creating parallel structures by linking ideas in a way that maintains grammatical consistency, thereby improving the overall flow and effectiveness of communication.
