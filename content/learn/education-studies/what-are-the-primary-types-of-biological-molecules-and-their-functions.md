    What are the primary types of biological molecules and their functions?
answer: >-
    Biological molecules are essential compounds that make up living organisms and are classified into four primary types: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Each type of biological molecule has distinct functions that are crucial for the survival and proper functioning of organisms. Here’s a detailed overview of each type:\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**:\n   - **Structure**: Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1.\n   - **Function**: \n     - Serve as a primary energy source (e.g., glucose).\n     - Provide structural support in cell walls of plants (e.g., cellulose) and exoskeletons of arthropods (e.g., chitin).\n     - Involved in cell recognition and signaling processes (e.g., glycoproteins and glycolipids).\n\n2. **Proteins**:\n   - **Structure**: Made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, forming polypeptide chains that fold into specific three-dimensional shapes.\n   - **Function**: \n     - Act as enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions (e.g., amylase).\n     - Provide structural support (e.g., collagen in connective tissues).\n     - Play roles in transport (e.g., hemoglobin transporting oxygen in red blood cells).\n     - Involved in immune responses (e.g., antibodies).\n\n3. **Lipids**:\n   - **Structure**: Diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids.\n   - **Function**: \n     - Serve as long-term energy storage (e.g., triglycerides).\n     - Form cell membranes (e.g., phospholipid bilayer).\n     - Act as signaling molecules (e.g., hormones like testosterone and estrogen).\n     - Provide insulation and protection for organs.\n\n4. **Nucleic Acids**:\n   - **Structure**: Composed of nucleotides, which include a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The two main types are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n   - **Function**: \n     - DNA stores and transmits genetic information essential for inheritance and cellular function.\n     - RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, with messenger RNA (mRNA) carrying genetic information from DNA to ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized.\n\nThese biological molecules are fundamental to the structure and function of cells, and they play critical roles in metabolism, homeostasis, and overall organismal biology. Understanding their functions helps elucidate the complex processes that sustain life.
