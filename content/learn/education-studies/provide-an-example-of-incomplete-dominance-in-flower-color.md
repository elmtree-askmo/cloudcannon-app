    Provide an example of incomplete dominance in flower color.
answer: >-
    An excellent example of incomplete dominance in flower color can be observed in snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus). In this case, when a red flower (genotype RR) is crossed with a white flower (genotype WW), the resulting offspring (F1 generation) exhibit a pink flower phenotype (genotype RW). This outcome demonstrates that neither the red nor the white allele completely dominates the other, leading to a blending of the two traits.\n\nIn summary, the key characteristics of incomplete dominance are:\n- The heterozygous phenotype (RW) is distinct from both homozygous phenotypes (RR and WW).\n- The resulting phenotype is an intermediate color, in this case, pink, which illustrates the blending effect of the alleles involved. \n\nThis phenomenon contrasts with complete dominance, where one allele completely masks the effect of the other, resulting in only one phenotype being expressed in the heterozygote.
