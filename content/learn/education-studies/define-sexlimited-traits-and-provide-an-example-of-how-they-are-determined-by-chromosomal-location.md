    Define sex-limited traits and provide an example of how they are determined by chromosomal location.
answer: >-
    Sex-limited traits are defined as traits that are present in both sexes of sexually reproducing species but are expressed in only one sex. This expression is primarily influenced by hormonal controls, meaning that the genes responsible for these traits may be present in both males and females, but their phenotypic effects are only observable in one sex. \n\nFor example, in dairy cattle, the genes that control milk yield and quality are present in both bulls and cows, but their effects are only expressed in female cattle. This is a classic example of a sex-limited trait, where the trait (milk production) is limited to one sex due to hormonal influences.\n\nSex-limited traits can be determined by genes located on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) or on sex chromosomes. While the term is often restricted to autosomal traits, it can also apply to genes on sex chromosomes that are only expressed in one sex. For instance, in some species of birds, certain plumage characteristics may be influenced by genes located on the Z chromosome, which are expressed only in males, leading to distinct male and female appearances.\n\nIn summary, sex-limited traits are characterized by their expression in only one sex, despite being genetically present in both, and their determination can involve both autosomal and sex-linked genes.
