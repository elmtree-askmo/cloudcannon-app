    What should be included in pre-exam announcements to students?
answer: >-
    In pre-exam announcements to students, it is essential to include several key elements to ensure clarity and preparedness. Based on the gathered information, here are the components that should be included:\n\n1. **Exam Format and Type**: Clearly outline the format of the exam (e.g., multiple choice, essay, open-book) and the platform it will be administered on (e.g., LMS Quiz, Gradescope, Cadmus). For example, you might say, "This exam will be completed using Gradescope and consists of 50 multiple choice questions."\n\n2. **Duration of the Exam**: Specify how long students will have to complete the exam. For instance, "The exam will last for 2 hours."\n\n3. **Instructions for Preparation**: Provide guidance on what students need to prepare or know before the exam. This could include study materials, allowable resources, and tips for effective preparation, especially for open-book exams.\n\n4. **Important Dates and Deadlines**: Include any critical dates related to the exam, such as the last date to submit applications or payment, if applicable.\n\n5. **Proctoring Information**: Inform students about who will be proctoring the exam (e.g., faculty member, administrative assistant) and how they can reach out with questions regarding proctoring.\n\n6. **Encouragement and Support**: Share encouraging messages to help students approach the exam with a positive mindset. This can enhance their mental well-being and academic performance.\n\n7. **Contact Information**: End the announcement with the name and contact information of the person responsible for the exam, so students know whom to reach out to with questions or concerns.\n\n8. **Technical Requirements**: If the exam is online, provide details about any technical requirements or troubleshooting tips to ensure students are prepared for the digital format.\n\nBy including these elements in pre-exam announcements, you can help students feel more informed and supported as they prepare for their exams.
