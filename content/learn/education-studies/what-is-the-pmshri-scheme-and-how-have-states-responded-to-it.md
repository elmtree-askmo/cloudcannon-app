    What is the PM-SHRI Scheme and how have states responded to it?
answer: >-
    The PM-SHRI Scheme, officially known as the Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India, is a centrally sponsored initiative launched by the Government of India in 2022. The primary objective of this scheme is to develop over 14,500 schools across the country by strengthening existing institutions managed by the Central Government, State Governments, Union Territories, and local bodies. The scheme is set to run from the 2022-23 fiscal year to 2026-27, with a total project cost of approximately ₹27,360 crores, which includes a central share of ₹18,128 crores.\n\nKey features of the PM-SHRI Scheme include:\n\n- **High-Quality Education**: The scheme aims to provide equitable and high-quality education, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.\n- **Beneficiaries**: It is expected to directly benefit over 18 lakh students.\n- **Implementation**: The scheme emphasizes creating a safe and stimulating learning environment where every student feels welcomed and cared for.\n\nStates' responses to the PM-SHRI Scheme have been mixed. As of now, five states—Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab, and West Bengal—have not yet signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the central government to participate in the scheme. \n\n- **Delhi and Punjab**: These states, governed by the Aam Aadmi Party, have opted out of the PM-SHRI Scheme because they already operate a similar initiative called "Schools of Eminence."\n- **West Bengal**: This state has also shown reluctance to participate.\n- **Tamil Nadu**: Initially agreed to sign the MoU but later sent a version that omitted a crucial paragraph regarding the implementation of the NEP 2020 in its entirety.\n\nThe Education Ministry has indicated that states cannot continue to receive funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) if they do not implement the PM-SHRI Scheme, highlighting the importance of this initiative in the broader context of educational reforms in India. \n\nOverall, while the PM-SHRI Scheme represents a significant investment in the education sector, the varying responses from states reflect differing priorities and existing educational frameworks.
