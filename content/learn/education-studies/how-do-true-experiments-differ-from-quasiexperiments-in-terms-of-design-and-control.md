    How do true experiments differ from quasi-experiments in terms of design and control?
answer: >-
    True experiments and quasi-experiments differ significantly in terms of design and control, which impacts their ability to establish causation.\n\n### True Experiments\n1. **Randomization**: True experiments involve random assignment of participants to different groups (e.g., treatment and control groups). This randomization helps to eliminate selection bias and ensures that any differences observed between groups can be attributed to the independent variable (IV) rather than pre-existing differences among participants.\n\n2. **Control Groups**: True experiments typically include a control group that does not receive the treatment or intervention. This allows researchers to compare outcomes between the experimental group (which receives the treatment) and the control group, providing a clearer picture of the treatment's effect.\n\n3. **Manipulation of Independent Variables**: In true experiments, researchers actively manipulate the IV to observe its effect on the dependent variable (DV). This manipulation is a key feature that allows for stronger causal inferences.\n\n4. **Causation**: Because of the randomization and control, true experiments are better suited for establishing causation. They meet the criteria for causation, including association, temporal precedence (the cause precedes the effect), and ruling out alternative explanations.\n\n### Quasi-Experiments\n1. **Lack of Randomization**: Quasi-experiments do not use random assignment. Instead, participants are assigned to groups based on pre-existing characteristics or conditions (e.g., age, gender, or location). This can lead to selection bias, as groups may differ in ways that affect the outcome.\n\n2. **Control Groups**: While quasi-experiments may include control groups, these groups are not formed through random assignment. This can complicate the interpretation of results, as differences between groups may be due to factors other than the IV.\n\n3. **Manipulation of Independent Variables**: Quasi-experiments may involve manipulation of the IV, but the lack of randomization means that researchers cannot confidently attribute any observed effects to the manipulation.\n\n4. **Causation**: Quasi-experiments are less effective at establishing causation due to the potential for confounding variables. Without randomization, it is more challenging to rule out alternative explanations for the observed effects.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, true experiments are characterized by randomization, control groups, and manipulation of variables, which collectively enhance their ability to establish causal relationships. In contrast, quasi-experiments lack randomization and may not adequately control for confounding variables, making it more difficult to draw definitive causal conclusions.
