    How was communication with students handled during the schedule adjustments?
answer: >-
    During the schedule adjustments following the hurricane, communication with students was handled through several key strategies aimed at maintaining open lines of communication and providing reassurance. Here are the main approaches taken:\n\n1. **Regular Check-Ins**: Educators were encouraged to maintain regular communication with students via email, text, or learning management systems. This was crucial in reassuring students that they were not alone during the recovery period and that their learning would continue despite the disruptions caused by the hurricane.\n\n2. **Empathy and Support**: Faculty were advised to communicate care and empathy by checking in on students' well-being and asking how they could be supported in their coursework. This approach was particularly important given the significant disruptions many students faced due to the hurricane.\n\n3. **Clear Announcements**: Important changes to the academic calendar and deadlines were communicated clearly to students. For instance, the deadline for faculty to submit midterm grades was moved to accommodate the disruptions, and students were informed about these changes promptly.\n\n4. **Addressing Basic Needs**: Communication also included addressing the immediate safety and basic needs of students and families affected by the hurricane. This was prioritized to ensure that students could focus on their academic responsibilities once they returned to school.\n\n5. **Flexibility in Teaching Plans**: Faculty were encouraged to consider adjustments to their teaching plans and course content, which were communicated to students as necessary. This included plans for make-up days and any changes in assignments or course requirements.\n\nOverall, the communication strategy focused on transparency, empathy, and support, ensuring that students felt informed and cared for during a challenging time.
