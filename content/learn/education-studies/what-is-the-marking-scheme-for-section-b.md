    What is the marking scheme for Section B?
answer: >-
    The marking scheme for Section B of the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science Examination typically consists of four questions, with a total of 20 marks allocated for this section. Each question may vary in the number of marks it carries, and the specific breakdown can include different types of questions such as matching, short answer, or descriptive questions. \n\nFor example, in previous examinations, there has been a matching component worth 4 marks, where students are required to match items from one column to their corresponding descriptions in another column. The remaining marks are distributed among the other questions, which may require students to demonstrate their understanding of basic scientific principles.\n\nIt is important for students to read the instructions carefully and manage their time effectively, as Section B is designed to assess their comprehension and application of the scientific concepts covered throughout the year.
