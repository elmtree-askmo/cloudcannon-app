    How does a references page differ from a bibliography in APA style?
answer: >-
    In APA style, a references page and a bibliography serve different purposes and contain different types of information.\n\n1. **References Page**: \n   - The references page is a list of all sources that have been cited within the text of the academic paper. It is titled "References" and includes full citations for each source, formatted according to APA guidelines. \n   - Each entry is arranged alphabetically by the author's last name and provides essential details such as the author's name, publication year, title of the work, and publication information. \n   - Importantly, the references page only includes sources that were directly cited in the paper, ensuring that every entry corresponds to a citation within the text.\n\n2. **Bibliography**: \n   - A bibliography, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive list that may include all sources consulted during the research process, regardless of whether they were cited in the paper. \n   - This means that a bibliography can contain works that were read but not directly referenced, as well as those that were cited. \n   - In APA style, a bibliography is not typically used; instead, the focus is on the references page, which maintains a clear connection between cited works and the text.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that the references page includes only the sources cited in the paper, while a bibliography may include additional sources that were consulted but not cited. This distinction is crucial for maintaining citation integrity and academic honesty in research documentation.
