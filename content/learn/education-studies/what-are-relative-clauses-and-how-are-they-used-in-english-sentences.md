    What are relative clauses, and how are they used in English sentences?
answer: >-
    Relative clauses are a type of dependent clause that provide additional information about a noun in a sentence. They are often introduced by relative pronouns such as "who," "whom," "which," "that," and "whose." These clauses can be categorized into two main types: defining relative clauses and non-defining relative clauses.\n\n1. **Defining Relative Clauses**: These clauses provide essential information about the noun they modify. Without this information, the meaning of the sentence would be incomplete. For example, in the sentence "The man who is wearing the blue shirt is my brother," the relative clause "who is wearing the blue shirt" specifies which man is being referred to. Defining relative clauses do not require commas.\n\n2. **Non-Defining Relative Clauses**: These clauses add extra, non-essential information about the noun. The sentence would still make sense without this information. For instance, in the sentence "My brother, who works as a software engineer, recently bought a new house," the clause "who works as a software engineer" provides additional information about the brother but is not necessary for understanding the main point of the sentence. Non-defining relative clauses are set off by commas.\n\nRelative clauses enhance sentence fluency and detail by allowing writers to combine information without starting new sentences. They help clarify the identity, location, or characteristics of a noun, making the writing more informative and cohesive. Understanding how to use relative clauses effectively is an important aspect of mastering English grammar.
