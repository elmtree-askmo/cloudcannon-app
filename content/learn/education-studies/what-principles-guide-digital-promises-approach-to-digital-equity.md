    What principles guide Digital Promise's approach to digital equity?
answer: >-
    Digital Promise's approach to digital equity is guided by its Digital Equity Framework, which consists of a comprehensive set of principles, guidelines, and policy recommendations aimed at bridging digital divides across various educational levels, including K-12 systems and higher education. The framework emphasizes the importance of ensuring equitable access, opportunities, and outcomes for all learners and households in a digitally driven society.\n\nKey principles of the Digital Equity Framework include:\n\n1. **Equitable Access**: The framework advocates for all individuals to have access to the necessary digital tools and resources, which is crucial for effective learning and participation in the digital world.\n\n2. **Opportunities for All**: It promotes the idea that every learner should have the opportunity to develop digital skills and competencies, which are essential for success in today's technology-driven environment.\n\n3. **Improving Outcomes**: The framework aims to enhance educational outcomes by addressing the disparities in digital access and usage, ensuring that all learners can thrive academically and socially.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach**: Digital Promise encourages a systematic approach to advancing digital equity, which involves collaboration among states, educational institutions, and communities to implement effective strategies and policies.\n\n5. **Bridging Divides**: The framework specifically targets the digital access, design, and use divides, as outlined in the 2024 National Educational Technology Plan, to create a more inclusive educational landscape.\n\nBy applying these principles, Digital Promise seeks to create a more equitable digital environment where all individuals, regardless of their background, can succeed in their educational pursuits and beyond.
