    What are the main phases of the Jockey Club Joyful@School Project?
answer: >-
    The Jockey Club Joyful@School Project consists of several main phases aimed at promoting mental well-being among students through various supportive measures. While the gathered information does not provide a detailed breakdown of the specific phases of the Joyful@School Project, it does highlight the project's focus on resilience, coping skills, and the involvement of students, parents, and teachers.\n\nThe project is designed to benefit a significant number of participants, including students from S1 to S6, their parents, and teachers, through resource packages and various activities such as seminars and workshops. The overarching goal is to create a positive and caring campus environment that fosters mental health and well-being.\n\nIf you are looking for a more detailed description of the specific phases of the Jockey Club Joyful@School Project, I cannot answer this question based on the available information, as it does not explicitly outline the phases involved. Further research or access to project documentation may be necessary to obtain that information.
