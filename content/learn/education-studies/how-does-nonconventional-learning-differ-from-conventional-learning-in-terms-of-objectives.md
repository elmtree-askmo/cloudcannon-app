    How does non-conventional learning differ from conventional learning in terms of objectives?
answer: >-
    Non-conventional learning differs from conventional learning primarily in terms of objectives and approaches to knowledge acquisition. \n\n1. **Objectives**: \n   - **Conventional Learning**: The objectives are often centered around standardized outcomes, such as mastering specific content knowledge, achieving high grades, and demonstrating proficiency through objective assessments. This approach typically emphasizes rote learning, discipline, and a structured curriculum that is teacher-led.\n   - **Non-Conventional Learning**: In contrast, non-conventional learning aims to foster critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to generate emergent forms of knowledge. The objectives are more flexible and can accommodate diverse learning styles and perspectives. This approach encourages learners to engage with real-world challenges, such as the climate crisis, and to develop skills that are relevant to sustainable development and social transformation.\n\n2. **Learning Environment**:\n   - **Conventional Learning**: It usually takes place in formal settings, such as classrooms, where the teacher is the primary source of knowledge and authority.\n   - **Non-Conventional Learning**: This can occur in various informal settings and often involves collaborative, experiential, and project-based learning methods. It allows for a more personalized learning experience where students can explore topics of interest and engage in meaningful discussions.\n\n3. **Assessment**:\n   - **Conventional Learning**: Assessment is typically objective, focusing on grades and standardized tests.\n   - **Non-Conventional Learning**: Assessment may be more subjective and can include self-assessment, peer feedback, and project-based evaluations that reflect a learner's understanding and application of knowledge in real-world contexts.\n\nIn summary, while conventional learning focuses on structured, standardized outcomes, non-conventional learning emphasizes flexibility, critical engagement, and the development of skills necessary for addressing complex global challenges.
