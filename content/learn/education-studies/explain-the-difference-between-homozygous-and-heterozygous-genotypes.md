    Explain the difference between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes.
answer: >-
    Homozygous and heterozygous genotypes are fundamental concepts in genetics that describe the genetic makeup of an individual concerning a specific gene.\n\n1. **Homozygous Genotypes**: An individual is said to be homozygous for a gene when they possess two identical alleles. This can occur in two forms:\n   - **Homozygous Dominant**: Both alleles are dominant (e.g., AA).\n   - **Homozygous Recessive**: Both alleles are recessive (e.g., aa).\n   In both cases, the individual will express the trait associated with the alleles they possess. For example, a pea plant with a genotype of TT (homozygous dominant) will exhibit tall stems, while a plant with a genotype of tt (homozygous recessive) will exhibit short stems.\n\n2. **Heterozygous Genotypes**: An individual is heterozygous for a gene when they have two different alleles (e.g., Aa). In this case, the dominant allele will typically mask the expression of the recessive allele, leading to the expression of the dominant trait. For instance, a pea plant with a genotype of Tt will also exhibit tall stems due to the presence of the dominant T allele.\n\nThe expression of traits can differ significantly based on whether an individual is homozygous or heterozygous, particularly in the context of dominant and recessive traits. Additionally, heterozygous genotypes can sometimes exhibit a phenomenon known as overdominance, where the heterozygous condition provides a fitness advantage compared to either homozygous condition, as seen in the case of sickle cell disease.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the alleles present:\n- **Homozygous**: Two identical alleles (AA or aa).\n- **Heterozygous**: Two different alleles (Aa). \n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for predicting inheritance patterns and the potential phenotypic outcomes in offspring.
