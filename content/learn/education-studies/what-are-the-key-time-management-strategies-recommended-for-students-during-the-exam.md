    What are the key time management strategies recommended for students during the exam?
answer: >-
    Key time management strategies recommended for students during exams include the following:\n\n1. **Create a Structured Study Schedule**: Prior to the exam, students should develop a detailed study plan that allocates specific times for each subject and topic. This helps ensure comprehensive coverage of the material.\n\n2. **Practice with Timed Tests**: Familiarizing oneself with the exam format by practicing full question papers under timed conditions can significantly enhance time management skills. This practice helps students gauge how long they should spend on each section.\n\n3. **Read the Entire Question Paper First**: Taking 5-10 minutes at the beginning of the exam to read through the entire question paper allows students to identify which questions they feel most confident about and which ones may require more time.\n\n4. **Prioritize Questions**: Students should prioritize questions based on their difficulty and the marks allocated. Starting with easier questions can build confidence and ensure that they secure marks early on.\n\n5. **Set Time Checkpoints**: Allocating specific time slots for each question or section can help students stay on track. For example, if an exam is 90 minutes long, they might decide to spend 30 minutes on each of three sections.\n\n6. **Leave Difficult Questions for Later**: If a student encounters a challenging question, it is often beneficial to move on and return to it later. This strategy helps prevent getting stuck and losing valuable time.\n\n7. **Review Answers Before Submitting**: If time permits, students should always leave a few minutes at the end to review their answers. This can help catch any mistakes or clarify any uncertainties.\n\n8. **Avoid Common Mistakes**: Students should be aware of common time management pitfalls, such as spending too much time on difficult questions or failing to allocate enough time for review.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, students can enhance their time management skills during exams, leading to improved performance and reduced stress.
