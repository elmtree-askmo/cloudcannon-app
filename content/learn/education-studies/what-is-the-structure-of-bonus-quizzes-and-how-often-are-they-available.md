answer: >-
    Bonus quizzes are structured as additional assessments designed to enhance students' understanding of course material and improve their grades. Here are the key features of these quizzes:\n\n1. **Multiple Attempts**: Students are allowed to retake the bonus quizzes multiple times. This flexibility encourages them to engage more deeply with the content and to seek help for any challenging concepts.\n\n2. **Score Recording**: Only the highest score achieved from these attempts will be recorded. This policy incentivizes students to keep trying until they achieve their best performance.\n\n3. **Review for Exam Preparation**: It is recommended that students review past quizzes as part of their study strategy for upcoming exams. This practice can reinforce learning and help solidify their understanding of the material.\n\nRegarding the frequency of availability, the gathered information does not specify how often the bonus quizzes are offered. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer on the frequency of these quizzes based on the available information.
