    What are the basic rules for forming negative sentences in French?
answer: >-
    To form negative sentences in French, the most basic rule involves using the construction "ne...pas" around the verb. Here are the key points to understand this structure:\n\n1. **Basic Structure**: The general formula for creating a negative sentence is:\n   - **ne + verb + pas**\n   For example:\n   - Affirmative: "Je parle français." (I speak French.)\n   - Negative: "Je ne parle pas français." (I do not speak French.)\n\n2. **Placement**: The word "ne" is placed before the conjugated verb, and "pas" follows it. This creates a negation around the verb, similar to using "not" in English.\n\n3. **Contraction**: In spoken French, "ne" can contract to "n'" when the verb begins with a vowel or a mute 'h'. For example:\n   - "Il n'aime pas le café." (He does not like coffee.)\n\n4. **Variations**: While "ne...pas" is the most common form of negation, there are other negative expressions in French, such as:\n   - **ne...jamais** (never)\n   - **ne...rien** (nothing)\n   - **ne...personne** (no one)\n   - **ne...nulle part** (nowhere)\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   - "Je ne mange pas de sucre." (I do not eat sugar.)\n   - "Il ne veut jamais sortir." (He never wants to go out.)\n\n6. **Contextual Use**: Understanding how to form negative sentences is essential for effective communication in French, as it is a fundamental aspect of the language's grammar.\n\nBy mastering these rules, you will be able to express negation clearly and accurately in French.
