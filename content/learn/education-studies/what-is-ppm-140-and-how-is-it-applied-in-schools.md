answer: >-
    Policy/Program Memorandum No. 140 (PPM 140) is a directive issued by the Ontario Ministry of Education, specifically designed to support students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the educational system. Released on May 17, 2007, PPM 140 provides a framework for school boards to incorporate methods of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) into their programs for students identified with ASD.\n\nThe key components of PPM 140 include:\n\n1. **Individualized Programs**: PPM 140 mandates that students with ASD receive individualized education programs (IEPs) that are tailored to their specific needs. These programs must utilize ABA methods, which focus on positive reinforcement and data collection to promote skill acquisition and behavioral improvement.\n\n2. **Transition Planning**: The memorandum emphasizes the importance of transition planning for students with ASD. School staff are required to plan for transitions between various activities and settings, ensuring that students are supported throughout their educational journey.\n\n3. **Collaboration and Support**: PPM 140 encourages collaboration among educators, parents, and community partners to effectively implement ABA strategies and support the educational needs of students with ASD. This includes providing training and resources to school staff and engaging parents in the process.\n\n4. **Framework for Implementation**: The policy serves as a guideline for school boards to follow, ensuring that they meet the Ministry of Education's expectations regarding the education of students with ASD. It aims to strengthen the quality of education and support provided to these students.\n\nOverall, PPM 140 plays a crucial role in shaping the educational experiences of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Ontario, ensuring that they receive appropriate support and resources to thrive in their learning environments.
