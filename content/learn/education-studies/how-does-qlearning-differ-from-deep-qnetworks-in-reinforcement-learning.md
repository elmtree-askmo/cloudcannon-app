    How does Q-Learning differ from Deep Q-Networks in reinforcement learning?
answer: >-
    Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are both algorithms used in reinforcement learning, but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities.\n\n### Q-Learning\nQ-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions in a given state, represented by a Q-table. The Q-table is a matrix where each entry corresponds to a state-action pair, and it is updated iteratively based on the rewards received from the environment. The update rule for the Q-value is given by:\n\n$$\nQ(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $Q(s, a)$ is the current Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$,\n- $\alpha$ is the learning rate,\n- $r$ is the reward received after taking action $a$ in state $s$,\n- $\gamma$ is the discount factor (a number between 0 and 1),\n- $s'$ is the new state after taking action $a$,\n- $a'$ represents possible actions in the new state.\n\nOne of the main limitations of Q-Learning is that it becomes infeasible for large state spaces, as the size of the Q-table grows exponentially with the number of states and actions.\n\n### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)\nDeep Q-Networks extend the capabilities of traditional Q-Learning by using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function. Instead of maintaining a Q-table, DQNs use a neural network to predict Q-values for all possible actions given a state. This allows DQNs to handle complex, high-dimensional environments that would be impractical for standard Q-Learning.\n\nKey features of DQNs include:\n- **Experience Replay**: DQNs utilize a technique called experience replay, where the agent stores its experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a memory buffer and samples from this buffer to train the neural network. This helps to break the correlation between consecutive experiences and stabilizes training.\n- **Target Network**: DQNs often employ a target network, which is a separate neural network that is updated less frequently than the main network. This helps to stabilize the learning process by providing consistent target values during updates.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n1. **Representation of Q-values**:\n   - Q-Learning uses a Q-table.\n   - DQNs use a deep neural network to approximate Q-values.\n\n2. **Scalability**:\n   - Q-Learning struggles with large state spaces due to the exponential growth of the Q-table.\n   - DQNs can handle complex, high-dimensional environments effectively.\n\n3. **Learning Techniques**:\n   - Q-Learning updates Q-values directly based on immediate rewards.\n   - DQNs incorporate experience replay and target networks to improve learning stability and efficiency.\n\n4. **Application**:\n   - Q-Learning is suitable for simpler problems with discrete state spaces.\n   - DQNs are used in more complex applications, such as playing video games or robotic control tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, while both Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks aim to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment, DQNs provide a more powerful framework for tackling complex problems by leveraging deep learning techniques.
