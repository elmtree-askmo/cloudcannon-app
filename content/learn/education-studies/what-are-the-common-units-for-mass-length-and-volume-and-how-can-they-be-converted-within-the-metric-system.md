    What are the common units for mass, length, and volume, and how can they be converted within the metric system?
answer: >-
    In the metric system, the common units for mass, length, and volume are as follows:\n\n- **Mass:** The base unit is the **kilogram (kg)**. It is defined as the mass of a specific platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\n- **Length:** The base unit is the **meter (m)**. The meter is defined based on the distance light travels in a vacuum in a specific fraction of a second.\n\n- **Volume:** The base unit is the **liter (L)**. One liter is equivalent to one cubic decimeter (1 L = 1 dm³), which is the volume of a cube that measures 10 centimeters on each side.\n\n### Conversion within the Metric System\n\nThe metric system is a decimal-based system, which makes it straightforward to convert between different units using prefixes. Here are some common prefixes:\n\n- **Milli- (m)**: Represents one-thousandth (1/1000). For example, 1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 meters (m).\n- **Centi- (c)**: Represents one-hundredth (1/100). For example, 1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meters (m).\n- **Kilo- (k)**: Represents one thousand (1000). For example, 1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m).\n\n### Examples of Conversion\n\n1. **Length Conversion:**\n   - To convert 5 meters to centimeters:\n     $$ \n     5 \, \text{m} \times 100 \, \text{cm/m} = 500 \, \text{cm} \n     $$\n\n2. **Mass Conversion:**\n   - To convert 3 kilograms to grams:\n     $$ \n     3 \, \text{kg} \times 1000 \, \text{g/kg} = 3000 \, \text{g} \n     $$\n\n3. **Volume Conversion:**\n   - To convert 2 liters to milliliters:\n     $$ \n     2 \, \text{L} \times 1000 \, \text{mL/L} = 2000 \, \text{mL} \n     $$\n\n### Special Relationships\n\nAdditionally, there are specific relationships in the metric system that are useful to remember:\n- 1 gram of water is equivalent to 1 milliliter of water (1 g = 1 mL).\n- 1 liter of water has a mass of approximately 1 kilogram (1 L ≈ 1 kg).\n\nThese conversions and relationships highlight the ease of using the metric system for scientific and everyday measurements.
