answer: >-
    In French, the first group of verbs, known as "-er" verbs, comprises the largest category of verbs, accounting for over 80% of all French verbs. These verbs are characterized by their infinitive form ending in "-er." Examples include "manger" (to eat), "chanter" (to sing), "parler" (to talk), and "donner" (to give).\n\n### Conjugation Rules for First Group '-er' Verbs\n\nTo conjugate a regular -er verb in the present tense, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove the -er**: Start by taking the infinitive form of the verb and removing the "-er" ending to find the stem (le radical). For example, the stem of "parler" is "parl-."\n\n2. **Add the appropriate endings**: The endings for the present tense conjugation of -er verbs are as follows:\n   - **je** (I) → -e\n   - **tu** (you, singular informal) → -es\n   - **il/elle/on** (he/she/one) → -e\n   - **nous** (we) → -ons\n   - **vous** (you, plural/formal) → -ez\n   - **ils/elles** (they, masculine/feminine) → -ent\n\n### Example Conjugation\n\nUsing the verb "parler" (to talk) as an example, the conjugated forms in the present tense are:\n\n- **je parle** (I talk)\n- **tu parles** (you talk)\n- **il/elle/on parle** (he/she/one talks)\n- **nous parlons** (we talk)\n- **vous parlez** (you talk)\n- **ils/elles parlent** (they talk)\n\n### Summary\n\nBy mastering the conjugation of regular -er verbs, learners can effectively conjugate a significant majority of French verbs, as this group represents the most common verb forms in the language. Understanding this pattern is essential for anyone looking to improve their French language skills.
