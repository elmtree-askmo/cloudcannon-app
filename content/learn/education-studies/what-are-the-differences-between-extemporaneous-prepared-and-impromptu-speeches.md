    What are the differences between extemporaneous, prepared, and impromptu speeches?
answer: >-
    The differences between extemporaneous, prepared, and impromptu speeches can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Extemporaneous Speeches**:\n   - **Preparation**: Speakers have time to prepare and organize their thoughts, typically ranging from a few minutes to several weeks.\n   - **Delivery Style**: These speeches are delivered in a conversational manner using brief notes rather than a full manuscript. This allows for eye contact with the audience and the ability to gauge their reactions.\n   - **Structure**: Extemporaneous speeches are carefully planned and rehearsed, providing a structured presentation while allowing flexibility to adapt based on audience engagement.\n\n2. **Prepared Speeches**:\n   - **Preparation**: These speeches are fully written and rehearsed in advance. The speaker knows exactly what they will say and may use a manuscript or memorized text.\n   - **Delivery Style**: Prepared speeches can be delivered from a script (manuscript) or from memory, which can enhance eye contact and engagement with the audience.\n   - **Structure**: The structure is typically rigid, as the speaker follows a predetermined script or outline.\n\n3. **Impromptu Speeches**:\n   - **Preparation**: Impromptu speeches are delivered without any prior preparation. The speaker must think on their feet and respond spontaneously to a prompt or question.\n   - **Delivery Style**: These speeches are often shorter and less formal, relying on the speaker's ability to articulate their thoughts quickly.\n   - **Structure**: The structure is usually less organized compared to extemporaneous and prepared speeches, as the speaker has no time to plan their content.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in the level of preparation, the style of delivery, and the structure of the speech. Extemporaneous speeches allow for preparation while maintaining a conversational tone, prepared speeches are fully scripted, and impromptu speeches require immediate, spontaneous responses.
