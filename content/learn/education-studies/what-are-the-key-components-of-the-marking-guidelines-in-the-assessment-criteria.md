answer: >-
    The key components of the marking guidelines in the assessment criteria for the quiz include the following:\n\n1. **Clarity of Definitions**: Students are evaluated on how clearly they articulate their definitions of the terms provided. This means that responses should be straightforward and easy to understand, demonstrating a solid grasp of the concepts.\n\n2. **Completeness of Short Essay Answers**: For the short essay questions, the completeness of the response is crucial. This involves addressing all parts of the question and providing a thorough explanation or argument that reflects a deep understanding of the topic.\n\n3. **Support for Opinions with Reasoning**: Students are expected to support their opinions with logical reasoning and evidence. This means that simply stating an opinion is not enough; students must back it up with relevant arguments or examples.\n\n4. **Articulation of Responses**: The instructor emphasizes that students do not need to provide extensive points to achieve full marks. Instead, a well-articulated response that effectively communicates the student's understanding can suffice for high marks.\n\nThese components ensure that the assessment is comprehensive and evaluates not only the knowledge of the students but also their ability to communicate that knowledge effectively.
