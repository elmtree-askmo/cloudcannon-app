    How does meiosis contribute to genetic variation?
answer: >-
    Meiosis plays a crucial role in contributing to genetic variation through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Crossing Over**: During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo a process called crossing over or recombination. This involves the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. As a result, new combinations of alleles are formed, which increases genetic diversity among the gametes produced.\n\n2. **Independent Assortment**: Meiosis also generates genetic variation through the independent assortment of chromosomes. During metaphase I, the orientation of each homologous chromosome pair is random, leading to different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes being distributed into the gametes. This means that the gametes can have a unique mix of chromosomes, further contributing to genetic diversity.\n\n3. **Formation of Unique Gametes**: The combination of crossing over and independent assortment results in the production of gametes that are genetically distinct from one another and from the parent organism. In humans, for example, meiosis can produce over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes in gametes due to these processes.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: When gametes from two parents combine during fertilization, the resulting zygote has a unique genetic makeup that is different from both parents. This further enhances genetic variation within a population.\n\n5. **Natural Selection**: The genetic variation produced by meiosis is essential for evolution. It provides the raw material for natural selection, as some combinations of alleles may confer advantages in terms of survival and reproduction. Over time, this can lead to adaptations within populations.\n\nIn summary, meiosis contributes to genetic variation through crossing over, independent assortment, and the formation of unique gametes, which are essential for the evolution and adaptability of species.
