    How will academic integrity be monitored during the test?
answer: >-
    Academic integrity during tests will be monitored through a combination of remote proctoring, technology, and assessment design strategies. Here are the key methods that will be employed:\n\n1. **Remote Monitoring**: A live proctor will oversee the test-taking process, with the capability to intervene if necessary. This ensures that students are adhering to the integrity standards throughout the examination.\n\n2. **Video Recording**: Test sessions will be recorded and reviewed by proctors after the test. This allows for a thorough examination of any potential integrity violations that may have occurred during the assessment.\n\n3. **Student Authentication**: Intelligent software will be used for student authentication, which may include biometric verification to ensure that the individual taking the test is indeed the registered student.\n\n4. **Flexible Testing Environment**: Students will be allowed to take tests at their convenience rather than being required to schedule a live proctoring session. This flexibility can help reduce stress and promote a more honest testing environment.\n\n5. **Assessment Design**: Utilizing tools such as question banks to create multiple versions of quizzes and exams can help minimize cheating. Randomizing questions and answer orders for different students further enhances the integrity of the assessment.\n\n6. **Clear Communication of Policies**: Institutions will communicate their academic integrity policies clearly and early in the course, ensuring that students understand the expectations and consequences related to academic misconduct.\n\n7. **Frequent, Low-Stakes Assessments**: Implementing frequent, low-stakes assessments can help uphold academic integrity while also providing a more accurate reflection of student learning.\n\n8. **Comprehensive Policies**: Having a well-defined policy and system in place can deter misconduct. For example, staff involved in test administration may be required to sign statements confirming their understanding of the testing rules and penalties for violations.\n\nThese strategies collectively aim to create an environment that fosters academic integrity and minimizes the likelihood of cheating during online assessments.
