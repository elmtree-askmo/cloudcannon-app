    What are the smallest units marked on a metric ruler, and how are they used in measurement?
answer: >-
    The smallest units marked on a metric ruler are typically millimeters (mm). Each millimeter is one-tenth of a centimeter (cm), and a standard metric ruler usually has markings for both centimeters and millimeters. \n\nIn practical use, the millimeter markings allow for precise measurements, especially for small objects or when high accuracy is required. For example, when measuring the length of a small item, such as a paper clip or a pencil, you would align one end of the object with the zero mark on the ruler and read the measurement at the other end, using the millimeter markings for finer detail.\n\nA metric ruler generally has longer lines that represent whole centimeters, with shorter lines in between indicating millimeters. This design makes it easy to read measurements accurately. For instance, if an object measures 5 cm and 3 mm, you would read it as 5.3 cm or 53 mm.\n\nIn summary, the millimeter is the smallest unit marked on a metric ruler, and it is essential for making precise measurements in various applications, particularly in scientific and technical fields.
