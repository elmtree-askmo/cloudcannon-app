    What examples are used in class to illustrate key concepts?
answer: >-
    In class, various examples are utilized to illustrate key concepts effectively. Here are some notable methods and examples:\n\n1. **Concrete Examples**: Instructors often present concrete examples that help students understand abstract concepts. For instance, when discussing fractions, a common approach is to use a pizza and demonstrate how it can be divided into slices to visually represent the concept of fractions.\n\n2. **Real-World Applications**: Incorporating real-world examples, such as current events or everyday life scenarios, is another effective strategy. For example, using news stories to illustrate historical events or scientific concepts can make the material more relatable and engaging for students.\n\n3. **Class Discussions**: During class discussions, students are encouraged to think critically about the topics being covered. Instructors may provide handouts or slides with key concepts and ask students to prepare examples or definitions to share during discussions. This not only reinforces understanding but also fosters a sense of academic community.\n\n4. **Writing Exercises**: A writing exercise can help students develop their ability to create and deploy examples. This exercise typically involves reading and discussing passages from texts where authors effectively use examples to illustrate concepts, followed by group work to develop their own examples.\n\n5. **Interactive Activities**: Activities like the "Move and Match" can be employed, where students physically search for cards that contain key terms and their definitions. This hands-on approach reinforces vocabulary and key concepts through active engagement.\n\nThese methods collectively enhance the learning experience by making abstract concepts more tangible and relatable, thereby improving student comprehension and retention.
