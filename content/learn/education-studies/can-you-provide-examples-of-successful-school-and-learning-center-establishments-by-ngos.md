answer: >-
    There are several notable examples of successful school and learning center establishments by NGOs that have made significant contributions to education, particularly for underprivileged communities. Here are a few prominent cases:\n\n1. **Pehchaan The Street School**: Established in 2015, this NGO focuses on providing education to underprivileged children. Pehchaan works tirelessly to ensure that these children have access to necessary educational materials and a supportive learning environment. Their community-directed education programs have shown a positive impact on school attendance and literacy rates among children who were previously excluded from formal education.\n\n2. **Siyafunda**: This South African NGO partnered with Cisco in 2009 to transform technology centers into Community Knowledge Centers (CKCs). The initiative aimed to educate underserved populations by providing access to technology and training. Siyafunda developed relationships with online universities, enhancing educational opportunities for the community and fostering a culture of learning.\n\n3. **Room to Read**: This organization has made a significant impact globally, focusing on literacy and girls' education. Room to Read has reported that it has positively affected the lives of over 23 million children through its various educational programs, which include establishing libraries and providing educational materials in schools.\n\n4. **BRAC**: One of the largest NGOs in the world, BRAC has enrolled over 12 million children in schools across various countries through its education programs. BRAC's initiatives focus on inclusive education and have been instrumental in improving educational access and quality in underserved areas.\n\nThese examples illustrate the vital role that NGOs play in establishing educational institutions and programs that cater to the needs of marginalized communities, ultimately contributing to poverty alleviation and social development.
