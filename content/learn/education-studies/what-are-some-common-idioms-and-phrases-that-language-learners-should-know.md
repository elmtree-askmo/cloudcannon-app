Here are some common English idioms and phrases that language learners should know, along with their meanings and examples:\n\n1. **Break the ice**: To initiate conversation in a social setting.\n   - *Example*: "I decided to break the ice at the party by asking about everyone's favorite movies."\n\n2. **A dime a dozen**: Something very common or easily found.\n   - *Example*: "Those generic souvenirs are a dime a dozen at every tourist shop."\n\n3. **Piece of cake**: Something that is very easy to do.\n   - *Example*: "Anne said the test would be difficult, but it was a piece of cake."\n\n4. **Chase rainbows**: To pursue unrealistic goals.\n   - *Example*: "I understand you want to be a famous singer, but don’t chase rainbows."\n\n5. **Spilled milk**: Refers to something that has happened and cannot be changed; it's pointless to worry about it.\n   - *Example*: "It’s no use crying over spilled milk."\n\n6. **Under the weather**: Feeling ill or unwell.\n   - *Example*: "I have my final test, but I’m feeling under the weather."\n\n7. **Losing my marbles**: Losing one's sanity or becoming confused.\n   - *Example*: "I’ve been so bad lately that I thought I’m losing my marbles."\n\n8. **Raining cats and dogs**: Raining very heavily.\n   - *Example*: "It’s raining cats and dogs when the Monsoon comes."\n\n9. **Last straw**: The final problem in a series of problems that causes one to lose patience.\n   - *Example*: "I’m not going to wait for the last straw."\n\n10. **All ears**: Eager to listen.\n    - *Example*: "You seem so serious.
