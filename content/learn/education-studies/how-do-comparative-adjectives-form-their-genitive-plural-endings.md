    How do comparative adjectives form their genitive plural endings?
answer: >-
    In Latin, comparative adjectives form their genitive plural endings by following the rules of the third declension. Specifically, the genitive plural ending for comparative adjectives is -um, rather than the expected -ium that is typical for i-stem nouns. \n\nTo elaborate, comparative adjectives are formed by adding the suffix -ior for masculine and feminine forms, and -ius for the neuter form to the base of the positive degree adjective. The base is derived from the genitive singular form of the adjective. For example, the Latin word for "long" is *longus, -a, -um*, and its comparative form is *longior* (for masculine and feminine) and *longius* (for neuter). The genitive singular forms are *longi* (masculine), *longae* (feminine), and the genitive plural form is *longorum* (masculine), *longarum* (feminine), and *longorum* (neuter).\n\nThus, the genitive plural for comparative adjectives consistently uses the ending -um, which distinguishes them from other third-declension adjectives that might follow different patterns. This is an important aspect of mastering Latin inflection rules, particularly for students learning to navigate the complexities of Latin grammar.
