    Name two spatial analysis techniques used in GIS.
answer: >-
    Two spatial analysis techniques commonly used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are:\n\n1. **Overlay Analysis**: This technique involves superimposing multiple data layers to identify relationships and patterns between different spatial features. For example, overlay analysis can be used to assess land use by combining layers of zoning, environmental constraints, and infrastructure to determine suitable areas for development.\n\n2. **Proximity Analysis**: This technique examines the distance between spatial features to understand their relationships. Proximity analysis can be used to find the nearest facilities, such as schools or hospitals, to a population center, helping planners make informed decisions about service accessibility and resource allocation.\n\nThese techniques are essential for effective spatial analysis, enabling users to derive insights from complex geographic data.
