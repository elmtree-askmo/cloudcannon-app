    What are the common terms for different hair colors and styles in Spanish?
answer: >-
    In Spanish, hair colors and styles can be described using specific vocabulary. Here are the common terms for different hair colors:\n\n### Hair Colors in Spanish\n1. **Black** - negro\n2. **Brown** - castaño\n3. **Blonde** - rubio\n4. **Red** - pelirrojo\n5. **Gray** - canoso\n6. **Dark Brown** - moreno\n\n### Hair Length Descriptions\n- **Short hair** - pelo corto\n- **Medium-length hair** - pelo de longitud media\n- **Long hair** - pelo largo\n\n### Hair Styles in Spanish\nHere are some common terms for different hair styles:\n1. **Ponytail** - coleta\n2. **Braids** - trenzas\n3. **Bun** - moño\n4. **Afro** - afro\n5. **Straight** - liso\n6. **Curly** - rizado\n7. **Wavy** - ondulado\n\nWhen describing hair in Spanish, it is important to remember that adjectives must agree in gender and number with the nouns they describe. For example, "pelo rizado" (curly hair) uses the masculine form of the adjective because "pelo" is masculine.\n\nThis vocabulary is essential for effective communication, especially in contexts such as describing someone's appearance or when visiting a hairdresser.
