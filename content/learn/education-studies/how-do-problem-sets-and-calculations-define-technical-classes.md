    How do problem sets and calculations define technical classes?
answer: >-
    Problem sets and calculations are fundamental components that define technical classes, which typically include subjects such as mathematics, science, and economics. These classes emphasize quantitative analysis and problem-solving, requiring students to engage with numerical data and apply various formulas to arrive at solutions.\n\n### Key Characteristics of Technical Classes:\n\n1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Technical classes often involve the analysis of numerical data. Students are required to interpret data sets, perform calculations, and derive conclusions based on quantitative evidence.\n\n2. **Problem Sets**: These are structured exercises that challenge students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. Problem sets help reinforce learning by providing opportunities to practice and apply concepts learned in class.\n\n3. **Calculations and Formulas**: Technical subjects frequently require the use of specific formulas to solve problems. For instance, in physics, the formula $E=mc^2$ is used to relate energy, mass, and the speed of light. In economics, formulas may be used to calculate elasticity or marginal costs.\n\n4. **PSA Framework**: In technical classes, a common note-taking strategy is the Problem, Steps, Answer (PSA) framework. This involves:\n   - **Problem**: Clearly stating the problem being addressed.\n   - **Steps**: Documenting the steps taken to solve the problem, which may include calculations, reasoning, and methodologies.\n   - **Answer**: Recording the final answer, along with any relevant units or interpretations.\n\n5. **Understanding Concepts**: Beyond just arriving at a numerical answer, students are encouraged to annotate their steps to understand the reasoning behind them. This deep understanding is crucial for applying knowledge to new problems and for future learning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, problem sets and calculations are integral to technical classes as they foster a hands-on approach to learning that emphasizes the application of knowledge. This contrasts with non-technical classes, which focus more on qualitative analysis and critical thinking. The distinct nature of technical classes necessitates specific note-taking strategies, such as the PSA framework, to effectively capture and synthesize information.
