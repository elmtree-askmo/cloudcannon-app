    How is the theme of class and educational limitations portrayed in the novel?
answer: >-
    In Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," the theme of class and educational limitations is intricately portrayed through the experiences of the protagonist, Jude Fawley. Jude, a working-class orphan, harbors aspirations of becoming a scholar and dreams of attending the prestigious university town of Christminster, which is modeled after Oxford. However, his journey is fraught with obstacles that highlight the rigid social stratification of Victorian England.\n\nEducation is depicted as a potential means for upward social mobility, yet Hardy emphasizes the harsh realities that thwart such ambitions. Despite Jude's intelligence and determination, he faces systemic barriers that prevent him from achieving his educational goals. For instance, Jude's working-class background leads to his rejection by Christminster, which denies him the opportunity to even sit for entrance exams. This rejection serves as a poignant critique of the English educational system, which Hardy suggests is designed to exclude the impoverished and maintain the status quo.\n\nMoreover, Jude's self-education and his relationship with Sue Bridehead, a highly intelligent woman, further illustrate his struggle between social classes. Although he possesses the intellectual capability to transcend his origins, Jude remains trapped in a liminal space, unable to fully integrate into the higher social class he aspires to join. This sense of isolation is compounded by the societal expectations and prejudices that dictate one's worth based on class.\n\nHardyâ€™s narrative ultimately critiques the societal structures that limit access to education and perpetuate class divisions. Jude's tragic fate underscores the futility of his aspirations in a world that is indifferent to the ambitions of those born into lower social strata. Through "Jude the Obscure," Hardy not only highlights the personal struggles of his characters but also offers a broader commentary on the injustices of the educational and social systems of his time.
