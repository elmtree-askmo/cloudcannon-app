    What is carbon sequestration and why is it important?
answer: >-
    Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Earth's atmosphere. This can occur through natural processes, such as photosynthesis in plants, or through human-engineered methods, such as capturing CO2 emissions from industrial facilities and power plants. The captured CO2 is then stored in various "pools," which can include forests, soils, oceans, and geological formations.\n\n### Importance of Carbon Sequestration\n\n1. **Mitigating Climate Change**: Carbon sequestration is crucial in the fight against climate change. Human activities have significantly increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere—by approximately 35% over the past 250 years—leading to global warming and associated climate impacts. By removing CO2 from the atmosphere, carbon sequestration helps to reduce the greenhouse effect, which is a major driver of climate change.\n\n2. **Long-term Storage**: The process allows for the long-term storage of carbon, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere. This is particularly important as around 45% of the CO2 emitted by humans remains in the atmosphere, contributing to ongoing climate issues.\n\n3. **Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health**: Natural carbon sequestration processes, such as those occurring in forests and wetlands, not only help in carbon storage but also support biodiversity and ecosystem health. Healthy ecosystems can enhance carbon storage capacity, creating a positive feedback loop.\n\n4. **Geological Sequestration**: This involves capturing CO2 from industrial sources and injecting it into underground geological formations. This method is increasingly recognized as a viable solution for managing emissions from sectors that are hard to decarbonize, such as cement and steel production.\n\n5. **Economic Opportunities**: Carbon sequestration technologies can create new economic opportunities, including jobs in the development and maintenance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities, as well as in the restoration of natural carbon sinks.\n\nIn summary, carbon sequestration is a vital component of the carbon cycle and plays a significant role in addressing climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels, supporting ecosystems, and providing economic benefits.
