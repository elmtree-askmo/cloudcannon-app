    What are the requirements for conducting the quiz in-class and the use of computers?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the requirements for conducting in-class quizzes and the use of computers can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Quiz Format**: In-class quizzes typically consist of multiple choice and true/false questions. They may also include essay questions, fill-in-the-blank items, and other formats depending on the instructional goals.\n\n2. **Open Book/Notes**: Quizzes are generally open book and open notes, allowing students to refer to their materials during the quiz.\n\n3. **Technology Integration**: The use of computers in the classroom can enhance the quiz experience. For instance, platforms like Kahoot and Quizizz can be utilized for interactive quizzes, making the process engaging and gamified. Additionally, tools like LockDown Browsers can be employed to maintain the integrity of the quiz by restricting access to other applications and websites during the assessment.\n\n4. **Quiz Length and Presentation**: For quizzes that exceed 20 questions, it is recommended to create the quiz as a Pages item and assign it as homework. When ready to administer the quiz, instructors can present the quiz folder to the students.\n\n5. **Assessment Integrity**: It is important to consider instructional goals and the integrity of students' work. Utilizing technology effectively can help ensure that assessments are fair and that students are held accountable for their performance.\n\n6. **Item Analysis**: After the quiz, instructors can conduct an item analysis using quiz reports to evaluate student performance on individual questions, which can inform future teaching strategies.\n\nIn summary, in-class quizzes can be effectively conducted using a combination of traditional formats and modern technology, ensuring that students are engaged while maintaining the integrity of the assessment process.
