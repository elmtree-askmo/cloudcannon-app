answer: >-
    Traditional definitions of myth generally characterize it as a narrative that explains the beliefs, values, and practices of a culture, often involving supernatural beings or events. Myths serve various functions, including providing moral lessons, cultural truths, and explanations for natural phenomena or social practices.\n\nKey characteristics of myths include:\n\n1. **Supernatural Elements**: Myths typically feature gods, demigods, or other supernatural beings. These characters often possess extraordinary powers and play crucial roles in the narratives. For example, in Greek mythology, gods like Zeus and Athena are central figures who influence human affairs and natural events.\n\n2. **Cultural Significance**: Myths are deeply embedded in the cultural and religious beliefs of a society. They reflect the values, morals, and worldviews of the people who tell them, serving as a means of cultural transmission across generations.\n\n3. **Explanatory Function**: Myths often provide explanations for natural events, human behavior, or cultural practices. They may elucidate phenomena such as the changing of the seasons, the creation of the world, or the origins of specific rituals. For instance, the myth of Demeter and Persephone explains the cycle of the seasons through the narrative of Persephone's descent into the underworld.\n\n4. **Timelessness**: Myths often possess a timeless quality, addressing universal themes and questions that resonate across different cultures and eras. This characteristic allows myths to remain relevant and influential in contemporary society.\n\nIn summary, myths are traditional stories that involve supernatural beings and serve to explain various aspects of human experience and the natural world, reflecting the cultural context in which they arise.
