    What are the allegations of cheating in the NEET-UG Exam Controversy?
answer: >-
    The NEET-UG Exam Controversy in 2024 has been marked by significant allegations of cheating and misconduct. Key points regarding these allegations include:\n\n1. **Question Paper Leaks**: On May 5, 2024, allegations surfaced regarding the leaking of question papers for the NEET-UG exam. While social media posts claimed that the exam questions had been compromised, the National Testing Agency (NTA) denied these allegations.\n\n2. **Unusually High Marks**: The controversy intensified as thousands of candidates reportedly secured unusually high marks in the exam, leading to widespread anger and protests among students and parents. This raised suspicions about the integrity of the examination process.\n\n3. **Arrests Related to Cheating**: Following the exam, a scandal erupted with the arrest of four individuals in Bihar for allegedly leaking the question papers. Additionally, in Godhra, Gujarat, five individuals, including a school principal and teacher, were arrested for attempting to assist 27 candidates in cheating during the NEET-UG exam.\n\n4. **Widespread Cheating Issues**: The NEET-UG controversy is part of a broader issue of exam malpractice in India, with reports indicating that there have been 70 confirmed exam leaks across 15 states over the past seven years. This has raised serious concerns about the integrity of the examination system in the country.\n\n5. **Grace Marks and Retests**: The controversy also involved a grace marks issue, leading to 1,563 candidates being required to retake the exam. This decision sparked further protests and calls for a re-examination.\n\n6. **Legal Proceedings**: The Supreme Court of India has been involved in the controversy, issuing notices to the government and the NTA regarding the allegations and the petition for the cancellation of the NEET-UG results.\n\nOverall, the NEET-UG Exam Controversy highlights significant challenges in maintaining the integrity of examinations in India, with ongoing calls for reform and stricter enforcement of examination protocols.
