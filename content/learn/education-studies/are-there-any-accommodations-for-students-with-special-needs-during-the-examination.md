answer: >-
    Yes, there are accommodations for students with special needs during the Fiji Year 12 Certificate Examination. The Ministry of Education in Fiji has established a policy framework aimed at ensuring access to quality education for all persons with disabilities. This framework emphasizes equity, inclusion, and access, which extends to examination settings.\n\nThe policy includes provisions for students with disabilities to receive necessary support during examinations, which may involve adjustments to the examination environment, additional time, or other accommodations tailored to individual needs. This approach is part of a broader commitment to inclusive education, ensuring that all students, regardless of their abilities, have the opportunity to succeed in their academic pursuits.\n\nFor specific details regarding the types of accommodations available, it would be advisable to consult the Ministry of Education's guidelines or the relevant educational authorities in Fiji.
