answer: >-
    Free Code Camp (FCC) was founded by Quincy Larson in 2014 with a clear mission and vision centered around providing free coding education to individuals worldwide. The mission of Free Code Camp is to help people learn to code for free, empowering them to transition from hobbyists to job-ready software engineers. This mission is particularly focused on busy adults who may not have the time or resources to pursue traditional coding education.\n\nThe vision behind Free Code Camp is to create a supportive community where learners can collaborate and grow together. The curriculum is designed to cover full-stack development, including languages and technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Python, and more. The platform emphasizes interactive learning and pair programming, fostering a culture of collaboration that helps students overcome challenges like impostor syndrome.\n\nFree Code Camp also aims to provide practical experience by partnering students with nonprofits to build web applications, allowing them to apply their skills in real-world scenarios. The community aspect is further enhanced by international, community-run groups where students can interact in person.\n\nOverall, Free Code Camp's mission and vision reflect a commitment to making coding education accessible and effective, helping thousands of individuals gain the skills necessary to secure jobs in the tech industry.
