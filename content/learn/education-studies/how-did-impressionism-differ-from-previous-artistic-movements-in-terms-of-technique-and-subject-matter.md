    Impressionism, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, marked a significant departure from previous artistic movements, particularly in terms of technique and subject matter.\n\n### Technique\n1. **Loose Brushwork**: Unlike the meticulous detail and smooth finishes characteristic of earlier movements such as Realism and Academic art, Impressionist artists employed loose, rapid brushstrokes. This technique allowed them to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, creating a sense of immediacy and spontaneity in their work.\n\n2. **Color and Light**: Impressionists focused on the effects of light and color, often painting en plein air (outdoors) to observe and depict natural light in real-time. They used vibrant colors straight from the tube, often applying them side by side rather than mixing them on a palette, which resulted in a more dynamic and luminous quality in their paintings.\n\n3. **Innovative Compositions**: Impressionist compositions often broke traditional rules of perspective and framing. They embraced unconventional viewpoints and cropped scenes, reflecting a more modern approach to visual representation.\n\n### Subject Matter\n1. **Modern Life**: Impressionism shifted the focus from historical, mythological, or religious themes prevalent in earlier art movements to scenes of everyday life. Impressionist artists depicted contemporary subjects, including urban landscapes, leisure activities, and the effects of industrialization, which were often considered inappropriate by traditional standards.\n\n2. **Nature and Landscapes**: While landscapes were a common subject in earlier art, Impressionists modernized this genre by incorporating elements of industrialization, such as railways and factories, into their works. This reflected the changing environment of 19th-century France and the impact of urbanization.\n\n3. **Cultural Reflections**: Impressionist paintings served as reflections of the cultural and social changes of the time. They captured the essence of a society in transition, where traditional values were being challenged, and new social dynamics were emerging, such as shifts in class structures and the rise of consumer culture.\n\nIn summary, Impressionism distinguished itself from previous artistic movements through its innovative techniques that emphasized light, color, and spontaneity, as well as its focus on modern life and the changing social landscape of the time. This movement not only transformed the art world but also laid the groundwork for subsequent developments in modern art.
