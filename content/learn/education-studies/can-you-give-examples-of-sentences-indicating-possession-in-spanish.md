    Can you give examples of sentences indicating possession in Spanish?
answer: >-
    In Spanish, there are two primary ways to indicate possession: using possessive adjectives and using the preposition "de" to show ownership. Here are some examples of sentences that illustrate both methods:\n\n1. **Using the preposition "de":**\n   - **Este es el libro de María.** (This is María's book.)\n   - **La casa de Juan es grande.** (Juan's house is big.)\n   - **El coche de mis padres es nuevo.** (My parents' car is new.)\n\n2. **Using possessive adjectives:**\n   - **Este es mi libro.** (This is my book.)\n   - **Su casa es hermosa.** (Her house is beautiful.)\n   - **Nuestros amigos vienen a cenar.** (Our friends are coming for dinner.)\n\nIn these examples, the first set uses "de" to indicate possession, while the second set employs possessive adjectives that agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. This dual approach allows for flexibility in expressing ownership in Spanish.
