    What did the Vice-President emphasize in his appeal to states regarding the National Education Policy?
answer: >-
    Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar emphasized the transformative potential of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 during his appeal to states that have not yet adopted it. He described the NEP as a "game-changer" for the nation and highlighted its significant focus on promoting education in the mother tongue. This appeal was made at an event in New Delhi, where he urged states to reconsider their stance on the policy, underscoring its importance in shaping the future of education in India. The NEP aims to create a more inclusive and effective education system that aligns with the aspirations of 21st-century learners while also respecting India's cultural and linguistic diversity.
