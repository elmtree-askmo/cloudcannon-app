    What is graded formative assessment?
answer: >-
    Graded formative assessment refers to a type of assessment that combines elements of formative assessment with grading. While traditional formative assessments are typically ungraded and used primarily to provide feedback to students and guide instructional practices, graded formative assessments may assign a grade based on student performance. This approach can serve to motivate students extrinsically, as they may receive credit for achieving a certain percentage of correct answers.\n\nThe debate surrounding graded formative assessments centers on their effectiveness and purpose. Many educators argue that formative assessments should remain ungraded to maintain their focus on improving student learning rather than on assigning grades. When grades are attached, some believe that the assessments lose their formative nature and may shift the focus from learning to performance.\n\nHowever, when designed thoughtfully, graded formative assessments can complement the learning process. They can help both students and teachers celebrate accomplishments and understand the learning journey. For instance, a teacher might use a graded quiz to assess understanding at the end of a unit, providing insights into what students have mastered and what areas need further attention.\n\nIn summary, while graded formative assessments can provide valuable feedback and motivation, they should be implemented carefully to ensure they support the primary goal of enhancing student learning.
