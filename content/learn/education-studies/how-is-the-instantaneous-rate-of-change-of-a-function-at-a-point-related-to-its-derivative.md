    How is the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point related to its derivative?
answer: >-
    The instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point is directly related to its derivative at that point. The derivative of a function provides a precise measure of how the function's output value changes as its input value changes, effectively representing the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function at that point.\n\nMathematically, the derivative of a function $ f $ at a point $ x $ is defined as:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n$$\n\nThis formula captures the concept of the instantaneous rate of change by taking the limit of the average rate of change of the function as the interval $ h $ approaches zero. Hereâ€™s how this relationship works:\n\n1. **Instantaneous Rate of Change**: This is the value of the derivative at a specific point. It tells us how fast the function is changing at that point. For example, if \( f(t) \) represents the position of an object over time, then \( f'(t) \) represents the object's instantaneous velocity at time $ t $.\n\n2. **Slope of the Tangent Line**: The derivative at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. This slope indicates the direction and steepness of the function at that specific input value.\n\n3. **Calculation Steps**: To find the instantaneous rate of change at a point:\n   - Identify the function \( f(x) \).\n   - Choose the point $ x $ where you want to find the instantaneous rate of change.\n   - Use the derivative formula to compute \( f'(x) \).\n\n### Example\nConsider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and we want to find the instantaneous rate of change at the point $ x = 3 $:\n\n1. **Function**: \( f(x) = x^2 \)\n2. **Point**: $ x = 3 $\n3. **Derivative Calculation**:\n   - Calculate \( f(3+h) = (3+h)^2 = 9 + 6h + h^2 \)\n   - Calculate \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)\n   - Substitute into the derivative formula:\n   $$\n   f'(3) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(9 + 6h + h^2) - 9}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} (6 + h) = 6\n   $$\n\nThus, the instantaneous rate of change of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) at the point $ x = 3 $ is $ 6 $.\n\nIn summary, the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point is synonymous with the derivative of that function at that point, providing critical insights into the function's behavior and characteristics.
