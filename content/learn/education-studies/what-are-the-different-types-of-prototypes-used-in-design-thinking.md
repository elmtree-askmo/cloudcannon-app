    What are the different types of prototypes used in design thinking?
answer: >-
    In design thinking, prototypes are essential tools that help teams visualize and test their ideas before finalizing a product. There are several types of prototypes, each serving different purposes and stages in the design process. Here are the main types of prototypes commonly used in design thinking:\n\n1. **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: \n   - These are quick and inexpensive to create, often made from simple materials like paper, cardboard, or digital platforms. \n   - Examples include sketches, storyboards, and paper cutouts representing different screens in a mobile app. \n   - Low-fidelity prototypes are useful for early-stage brainstorming and gathering initial feedback on concepts.\n\n2. **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: \n   - These prototypes closely resemble the final product in terms of design, functionality, and user experience. \n   - They are typically used in later stages of development when teams are ready to validate their designs. \n   - Examples include 3D physical models or beta versions of software applications. High-fidelity prototypes allow for more detailed user testing and feedback.\n\n3. **Interactive Prototypes**: \n   - These prototypes allow users to interact with the design, simulating the experience of using the final product. \n   - They can be created using digital tools that enable clickable interfaces, providing a more realistic user experience.\n\n4. **Role-Playing Prototypes**: \n   - This method involves acting out the service experience to identify pain points and areas for improvement. \n   - It helps teams understand user interactions and emotional responses in a real-world context.\n\n5. **Customer Journey Maps**: \n   - These visual representations outline the user's experience across different touchpoints within a service. \n   - They help teams identify opportunities for improvement and innovation in the user experience.\n\n6. **Service Prototypes**: \n   - These can include various methods to simulate service delivery, such as role-playing or creating scenarios that depict user interactions with the service.\n\nEach type of prototype serves a unique purpose in the design thinking process, allowing teams to iterate and refine their ideas based on user feedback and insights. By employing a mix of these prototypes, designers can effectively explore and validate their concepts before moving to final development.
