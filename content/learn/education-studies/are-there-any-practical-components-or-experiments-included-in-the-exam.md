    Are there any practical components or experiments included in the exam?
answer: >-
    Based on the available information, there is no specific mention of practical components or experiments included in the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science Examination for 2017. The exam structure primarily consists of written questions, including multiple-choice questions and possibly short answer or essay-type questions, as indicated by the instructions and guidelines provided for the exam.\n\nThe focus of the examination appears to be on assessing students' understanding of various scientific concepts, including adaptation, ecological concepts, physical and chemical science topics, energy and forces, as well as geological and meteorological concepts. However, without explicit details regarding practical experiments or hands-on components in the gathered information, it cannot be confirmed whether such elements are part of the exam.\n\nIf you are looking for more detailed information about the exam's structure or specific content, it may be beneficial to consult official resources from the Ministry of Education in Fiji or review past examination papers for further insights.
