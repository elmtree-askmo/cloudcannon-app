    Describe the structure of DNA and its role in genetic inheritance.
answer: >-
    DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material found in all known living organisms and many viruses. It plays a crucial role in genetic inheritance, carrying the genetic instructions necessary for growth, development, functioning, and reproduction.\n\n### Structure of DNA\n\n1. **Double Helix**: DNA is structured as a double helix, which consists of two long strands that coil around each other. This structure was famously described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.\n\n2. **Nucleotides**: Each strand of DNA is made up of smaller units called nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of three components:\n   - A **sugar** molecule (deoxyribose)\n   - A **phosphate group**\n   - A **nitrogenous base** (one of four types: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G))\n\n3. **Base Pairing**: The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. The bases pair specifically: adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). This complementary base pairing is essential for DNA replication and function.\n\n4. **Gene Encoding**: The sequence of these nitrogenous bases encodes genetic information. Each segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein is called a gene. The specific sequence of bases in a gene determines the production of proteins, which perform various functions in the body, including determining traits such as eye color.\n\n### Role in Genetic Inheritance\n\n1. **Replication**: During cell division, DNA replicates itself, ensuring that each new cell receives an exact copy of the genetic material. This process is vital for inheritance, as it allows genetic information to be passed from one generation to the next.\n\n2. **Transmission of Traits**: When organisms reproduce, they pass on their DNA to their offspring. This transmission of genetic material is the basis of heredity. The combination of genes inherited from both parents determines the traits of the offspring.\n\n3. **Mutation and Variation**: Occasionally, errors can occur during DNA replication, leading to mutations. These mutations can introduce genetic variation within a population, which is a key factor in the process of evolution and natural selection.\n\nIn summary, DNA's structure as a double helix composed of nucleotides allows it to store and transmit genetic information effectively. Its role in genetic inheritance is fundamental to the continuity of life and the diversity of traits observed in living organisms.
