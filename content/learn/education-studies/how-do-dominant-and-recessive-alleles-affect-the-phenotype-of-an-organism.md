    How do dominant and recessive alleles affect the phenotype of an organism?
answer: >-
    Dominant and recessive alleles play a crucial role in determining the phenotype of an organism, which is the observable expression of traits. Hereâ€™s how they affect phenotypes:\n\n1. **Dominant Alleles**: A dominant allele is expressed in the phenotype even if only one copy is present. This means that an individual can have either:\n   - Homozygous dominant genotype (e.g., "BB"), or\n   - Heterozygous genotype (e.g., "Bb").\n   \n   In both cases, the dominant trait will be expressed. For example, if "B" represents a dominant allele for brown eyes, both "BB" and "Bb" genotypes will result in the phenotype of brown eyes.\n\n2. **Recessive Alleles**: A recessive allele is only expressed in the phenotype when two copies are present, which is referred to as being homozygous recessive (e.g., "bb"). Using the previous example, only the genotype "bb" (two recessive alleles) will result in the phenotype of blue eyes. Thus, the recessive trait remains unexpressed in the presence of a dominant allele.\n\n3. **Masking Effect**: In a heterozygous condition, the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele. This means that while the recessive trait is present in the genotype, it does not manifest in the phenotype. This principle is a key aspect of Mendelian genetics, which states that in a heterozygote, the dominant allele will cause the recessive allele to be "masked."\n\n4. **Genotype Representation**: The representation of alleles is standardized, where dominant alleles are denoted by uppercase letters (e.g., "B") and recessive alleles by lowercase letters (e.g., "b"). The possible genotypes for a trait can be categorized as:\n   - Homozygous dominant (e.g., "BB")\n   - Heterozygous (e.g., "Bb")\n   - Homozygous recessive (e.g., "bb")\n\n5. **Genetic Ratios**: In a typical Mendelian cross involving one trait, the expected phenotypic ratio among the offspring can be summarized as follows:\n   - 25% homozygous dominant (expressing the dominant trait)\n   - 50% heterozygous (also expressing the dominant trait)\n   - 25% homozygous recessive (expressing the recessive trait)\n\nIn summary, dominant alleles dictate the phenotype when present, while recessive alleles only express their traits when in a homozygous condition. This interaction between dominant and recessive alleles is fundamental to understanding genetic inheritance and variation in traits among organisms.
