answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information does not provide specific details about the achievements and milestones of the ITulay program since its inception. It primarily discusses general concepts related to project milestones and educational initiatives without focusing on the specific accomplishments of the ITulay program. If you have access to more detailed sources or specific milestones related to the ITulay program, I would be happy to help you formulate that information into a comprehensive response.
