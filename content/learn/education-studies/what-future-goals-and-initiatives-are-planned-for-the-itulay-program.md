    What future goals and initiatives are planned for the ITulay program?
answer: >-
    The ITulay program, led by ICTS-EdTech Unit Head Mark Anthony Sy, has set several future goals and initiatives aimed at enhancing educational support for students, parents, and teachers. As of the start of 2021, the program's primary objectives include:\n\n1. **Empowering Parents**: The initiative aims to empower parents by providing them with the confidence and tools necessary to assist their children in their learning processes.\n\n2. **Enhancing Learner Understanding**: ITulay seeks to ensure that learners fully comprehend the lessons being taught, thereby improving their educational outcomes.\n\n3. **Supporting Teachers**: The program also focuses on helping teachers effectively explain lessons, which is crucial for fostering a productive learning environment.\n\nThese goals reflect a commitment to creating a more interactive and supportive educational framework, which is not strictly bound by traditional classroom formats. The emphasis on online tutoring indicates a flexible approach to education that adapts to the needs of students and their families.\n\nWhile specific future initiatives beyond these goals are not detailed in the gathered information, the overarching strategy suggests a continued focus on enhancing community engagement and leveraging technology to facilitate learning. This could involve the development of new online resources, training programs for parents and teachers, and interactive learning activities that promote critical thinking and collaboration among students.\n\nOverall, the ITulay program is positioned to evolve and adapt to the changing educational landscape, with a strong emphasis on community involvement and support for all stakeholders in the learning process.
