answer: >-
    In response to the impact of hurricanes, various resources have been provided to help students cope with the aftermath. The U.S. Department of Education has announced a series of resources and assistance programs specifically designed for schools and communities affected by hurricanes. These resources include:\n\n1. **Mental Health Support**: There are dedicated resources aimed at providing mental health support for both students and educators. This includes guidance on how to restore learning environments and promote coping skills in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\n2. **Technical Assistance**: The Department of Education offers technical assistance to help educational institutions access federal resources and manage federal financial aid programs effectively. This includes automatically enrolling affected borrowers with missed payments into a natural disaster forbearance.\n\n3. **Crisis Response Resources**: Schools are encouraged to utilize resources such as "Psychological First Aid" and "Skills for Psychological Recovery," developed by the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress (NCTSN). These resources are designed to help staff support students who may be experiencing stress and trauma following a natural disaster.\n\n4. **Local Support Initiatives**: Many school districts have established their own crisis teams and resources to assist students and families as they return to school. This includes communication strategies and support systems tailored to the needs of the community.\n\n5. **Community Resources**: Institutions like the University of South Florida (USF) have recognized the academic, financial, and personal challenges faced by students due to hurricanes and have compiled resources to assist those impacted.\n\nThese resources aim to provide comprehensive support to students, helping them navigate the challenges posed by the hurricane's impact on their education and well-being.
