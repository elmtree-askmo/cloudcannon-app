answer: >-
    In short essay answers, the requirements for completeness and support are crucial for achieving a high score. Based on the gathered information, here are the key points:\n\n1. **Completeness**: Students are expected to answer the question fully, addressing all elements that are asked. This means that the response should not only provide an opinion but also ensure that it covers the specific aspects of the question. A well-articulated response, even if concise, can suffice to demonstrate understanding.\n\n2. **Support**: It is essential to support opinions with reasoning. This involves providing justification for the viewpoint expressed in the answer. While extensive points are not necessary, the response should include enough reasoning to make the opinion credible. A couple of paragraphs are typically sufficient to convey this support effectively.\n\n3. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The focus of short essays is on clarity and conciseness. Students should aim to express their thoughts clearly without unnecessary elaboration. This means that while the answer should be complete and supported, it should also be straightforward and to the point.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Structure**: Students do not need to adhere to a rigid structure such as a thesis statement followed by multiple supporting points. Instead, a coherent opinion presented in one or two paragraphs is acceptable, allowing for a more natural flow of ideas.\n\nIn summary, to meet the requirements for completeness and support in short essay answers, students should ensure their responses are thorough, well-reasoned, clear, and concise, while also being flexible in their approach to structuring the answer.
