answer: >-
    Realism is an artistic movement that emerged in the mid-19th century, primarily as a reaction against the preceding Romanticism. Here are the key characteristics of Realism and how it differed from earlier art movements:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Realism:\n1. **Focus on Everyday Life**: Realism sought to depict ordinary people and everyday situations, emphasizing the lives of the working class and the struggles they faced. This was a significant shift from the grand historical and mythological themes prevalent in Romanticism.\n\n2. **Accuracy and Honesty**: Realist artists aimed to represent the world as it truly is, without idealization or embellishment. They focused on portraying subjects with a sense of authenticity, often highlighting social issues and the harsh realities of life.\n\n3. **Social Commentary**: Many Realist works served as a critique of society, addressing issues such as poverty, labor, and social injustice. This focus on social themes was a departure from the more individualistic and emotional expressions found in Romantic art.\n\n4. **Naturalism**: While closely related to Naturalism, which emphasized a precise and unembellished representation of reality, Realism was more concerned with the artist's subjective experience of the world. Realists aimed to capture the essence of life as they experienced it, rather than merely replicating it in a photographic manner.\n\n5. **Notable Artists**: Key figures in the Realist movement include Gustave Courbet, who is often considered the father of Realism, and Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, known for his depictions of rural life.\n\n### Differences from Previous Art Movements:\n- **Contrast with Romanticism**: Romanticism celebrated emotion, individualism, and the sublime aspects of nature, often idealizing subjects and focusing on dramatic themes. In contrast, Realism rejected these ideals, opting instead for a more grounded and truthful representation of life.\n\n- **Shift from Idealization**: Previous movements, such as Neoclassicism and Romanticism, often idealized their subjects, portraying them in a glorified manner. Realism, however, aimed to depict subjects as they were, including their flaws and struggles.\n\n- **Response to Industrialization**: The rise of industrial society and urbanization during the 19th century influenced Realist artists to focus on contemporary life and the experiences of the working class, which was often overlooked in earlier art movements.\n\nIn summary, Realism marked a significant shift in the art world by prioritizing the depiction of everyday life and social issues, moving away from the idealized and emotional expressions of Romanticism. This movement laid the groundwork for later artistic developments, including Impressionism and Expressionism, by emphasizing the importance of the artist's perspective and the realities of contemporary society.
