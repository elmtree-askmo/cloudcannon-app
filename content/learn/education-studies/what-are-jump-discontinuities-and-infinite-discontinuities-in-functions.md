    What are jump discontinuities and infinite discontinuities in functions?
answer: >-
    Jump discontinuities and infinite discontinuities are two specific types of discontinuities that can occur in functions.\n\n### Jump Discontinuities\nA jump discontinuity occurs at a point where the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit exist but are not equal. This means that as you approach the point from the left side, the function approaches one value, and as you approach from the right side, it approaches a different value. \n\n**Example**: Consider the piecewise function defined as follows:\n- \( f(x) = 1 \) for $ x < 0 $\n- \( f(x) = 2 \) for $ x \geq 0 $\n\nAt $ x = 0 $:\n- The left-hand limit, \( \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = 1 \)\n- The right-hand limit, \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = 2 \)\n\nSince these two limits are not equal, there is a jump discontinuity at $ x = 0 $.\n\n### Infinite Discontinuities\nAn infinite discontinuity occurs when the function approaches infinity (or negative infinity) as $ x $ approaches a certain value. This typically happens at points where the function is undefined, such as vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Example**: The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) has an infinite discontinuity at $ x = 0 $. As $ x $ approaches 0 from the left, \( f(x) \) approaches negative infinity, and as $ x $ approaches 0 from the right, \( f(x) \) approaches positive infinity:\n- \( \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) = -\infty \)\n- \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = +\infty \)\n\nIn summary, understanding these types of discontinuities is essential for analyzing the behavior of functions and their limits in calculus.
