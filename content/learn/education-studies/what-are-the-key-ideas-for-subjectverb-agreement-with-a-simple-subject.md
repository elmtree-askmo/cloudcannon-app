answer: >-
    Subject-verb agreement is a fundamental aspect of English grammar that ensures clarity and correctness in writing. Here are the key ideas regarding subject-verb agreement with a simple subject:\n\n1. **Singular and Plural Agreement**: The primary rule of subject-verb agreement is that singular subjects must be paired with singular verbs, while plural subjects must be paired with plural verbs. For example:\n   - Singular: "The cat **runs** fast."\n   - Plural: "The cats **run** fast."\n\n2. **Third-Person Singular**: When the subject is third-person singular (he, she, it), the verb must also be in its singular form, particularly in the present tense. For instance:\n   - "She **writes** every day."\n\n3. **Compound Subjects**: If a compound subject is formed by two or more singular nouns or pronouns connected by "and," a plural verb is used:\n   - "The cat and the dog **are** friends."\n   Conversely, if the subjects are connected by "or" or "nor," the verb should agree with the nearest subject:\n   - "Either the cat or the dog **is** barking."\n\n4. **Intervening Words**: Be cautious of words that may come between the subject and the verb. The verb must agree with the simple subject, not with any intervening words. For example:\n   - "The bouquet of flowers **is** beautiful." (Here, "bouquet" is the simple subject, which is singular.)\n\n5. **Common Errors**: Many writers struggle with subject-verb agreement, especially when dealing with collective nouns or when the subject is not immediately clear. It's essential to identify the true subject to ensure proper agreement.\n\n6. **Importance of Clarity**: Proper subject-verb agreement enhances the clarity of writing, making it easier for readers to understand the intended meaning. Incorrect agreement can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.\n\nBy mastering these rules, writers can improve their grammatical accuracy and enhance the overall quality of their writing. Regular practice and attention to detail are key to achieving proficiency in subject-verb agreement.
