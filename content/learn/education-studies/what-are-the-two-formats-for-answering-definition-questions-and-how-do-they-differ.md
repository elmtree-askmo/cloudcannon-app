    What are the two formats for answering definition questions, and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    The two formats for answering definition questions are typically **closed questions** and **open questions**. Hereâ€™s how they differ:\n\n1. **Closed Questions**:\n   - **Definition**: These questions can be answered with a specific response or a limited set of options. They often require a straightforward answer, such as a single word or a short phrase.\n   - **Example**: "What is the definition of 'photosynthesis'?" The expected answer would be a concise definition, such as "the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll."\n   - **Characteristics**: Closed questions are usually objective and can be assessed easily for correctness. They are often used in multiple-choice or true/false formats.\n\n2. **Open Questions**:\n   - **Definition**: These questions require a more detailed or subjective response, allowing for a wide range of answers. They often ask for explanations or elaborations on a term or concept.\n   - **Example**: "Explain the process of photosynthesis." This would require a more comprehensive answer, detailing the steps involved in photosynthesis, the role of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, and the significance of the process in the ecosystem.\n   - **Characteristics**: Open questions provide less control over the responses and are typically used for qualitative assessments. They allow for deeper exploration of a concept and can reveal the respondent's understanding and reasoning.\n\nIn summary, closed questions focus on specific, concise answers, while open questions encourage elaboration and detailed explanations.
