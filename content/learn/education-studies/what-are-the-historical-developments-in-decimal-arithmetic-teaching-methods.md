    What are the historical developments in decimal arithmetic teaching methods?
answer: >-
    The historical developments in teaching methods for decimal arithmetic can be traced back to several key periods and influences, particularly from the early Modern Age to the 20th century. \n\n1. **Early Modern Age**: The teaching of arithmetic, including decimals, began with the Italian reckoning masters and their arithmetic textbooks known as *libri di abbaco*. These texts were based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, which introduced a more systematic approach to arithmetic, including the use of decimal fractions.\n\n2. **19th Century Developments**: The evolution of teaching methods continued through the 19th century, particularly influenced by German scholars. A series of articles published in the journal *Inland Educator* from 1895 to 1986 analyzed these developments, focusing on didactical ideas and the pedagogical approaches that emerged during this time. This period saw a critical examination of how decimals were integrated into arithmetic curricula.\n\n3. **Psychological Theories and Curriculum Changes**: The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics published a significant article in April 1970 that explored changes in arithmetic teaching from 1800 to the "new" mathematics. This article highlighted the impact of psychological theories on teaching methods and the foundational changes in arithmetic curricula, including the place of decimal fractions in U.S. school arithmetic.\n\n4. **Colonial Education**: In the North American colonies before 1790, the teaching of arithmetic, including decimals, was influenced by policies and practices related to weights and measures. Early academies, such as the Academy of Philadelphia founded by Benjamin Franklin, included arithmetic in their curricula, which laid the groundwork for future educational practices.\n\n5. **20th Century and Beyond**: The 20th century saw a shift towards inquiry-based classrooms, where teaching methods were informed by research on how students understand decimals. This approach emphasized practical applications, such as using money to teach decimal concepts, which helped students relate decimals to real-world scenarios.\n\nOverall, the teaching of decimal arithmetic has evolved significantly, influenced by historical practices, educational theories, and practical applications, leading to a more structured and effective approach to teaching decimals in modern education.
