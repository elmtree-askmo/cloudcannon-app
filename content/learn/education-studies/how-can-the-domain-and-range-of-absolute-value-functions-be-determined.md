    How can the domain and range of absolute value functions be determined?
answer: >-
    To determine the domain and range of absolute value functions, we can follow a systematic approach based on the properties of these functions.\n\n### Domain of Absolute Value Functions\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (or $x$-values) that the function can accept. For absolute value functions, such as \(f(x) = |x|\), the domain is all real numbers. This is because you can input any real number into the absolute value function, and it will produce a valid output. Therefore, the domain can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Domain: } (-\infty, +\infty)\n$$\n\n### Range of Absolute Value Functions\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (or \(f(x)\)-values) that the function can produce. For the absolute value function \(f(x) = |x|\):\n\n1. **Understanding the Output**: The absolute value function returns the non-negative value of its input. This means that regardless of whether $x$ is positive or negative, \(f(x)\) will always be zero or positive.\n\n2. **Graphing the Function**: Graphing \(f(x) = |x|\) shows that the function has a V-shape, with the vertex at the origin (0,0). As $x$ moves away from zero in either direction, the output increases.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Output Values**: Since the smallest value of \(f(x)\) occurs at $x = 0$ (where \(f(0) = 0\)), and there is no upper limit to the values \(f(x)\) can take as $x$ increases or decreases, the range is all non-negative real numbers.\n\nThus, the range can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } [0, +\infty)\n$$\n\n### Summary\nFor the absolute value function \(f(x) = |x|\):\n- **Domain**: All real numbers, \((-∞, +∞)\)\n- **Range**: All non-negative real numbers, \([0, +∞)\)\n\nThis analysis can be applied similarly to other absolute value functions, such as \(f(x) = |x - a|\) or \(f(x) = |bx + c|\), where the domain remains all real numbers and the range will always be \([0, +\infty)\) due to the nature of the absolute value operation.
