    What are the current state-level bans and restrictions on cell phone use in schools?
answer: >-
    As of October 2023, several states in the U.S. have enacted laws or policies that restrict or ban cell phone use in schools, reflecting growing concerns about youth mental health and academic performance. Here are some key developments:\n\n1. **Florida**: In 2023, Florida became the first state to implement a statewide ban on cell phone use during class. The law, which took effect on July 1, prohibits students from using smartphones and accessing social media while connected to the school's Wi-Fi.\n\n2. **California**: Following Florida, California passed legislation requiring all public schools to develop and implement policies that restrict student smartphone use during school hours. This law mandates that school districts create these policies by March 15, 2025.\n\n3. **Ohio and Indiana**: Both states passed legislation in 2023 that requires school districts to establish policies regulating student cellphone use during school hours, aiming to reduce distractions and promote a better learning environment.\n\n4. **Wider Trends**: At least 18 states have either passed laws or enacted policies that ban or restrict cellphone use in schools. These restrictions vary; some allow phone use during lunch or between classes, while others impose stricter bans.\n\n5. **Legislative Context**: The resurgence of cellphone bans is partly in response to advisories from the U.S. Surgeon General regarding the youth mental health crisis and the negative impacts of social media. Policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need to address the potential harms associated with excessive smartphone use among students.\n\nOverall, the trend indicates a growing consensus among states to limit smartphone access in educational settings to enhance student focus and well-being.
