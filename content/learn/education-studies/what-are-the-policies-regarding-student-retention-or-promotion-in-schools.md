    What are the policies regarding student retention or promotion in schools?
answer: >-
    The policies regarding student retention or promotion in schools are typically established through a collaborative process involving all teaching staff. Here are the key points regarding these policies:\n\n1. **Promotion Criteria**: Students must meet specific academic standards set by the school to be promoted to the next grade level. For instance, students who fail to achieve passing grades in core subjects such as Chinese, English, or Mathematics, or who do not meet conduct standards, are not eligible for promotion.\n\n2. **Supplementary Exams**: Students who do not meet the promotion criteria may be considered for supplementary exams if they meet certain conditions. This is particularly relevant for students in grades 1 to 3, where a total average score below 50 may lead to decisions made during promotion meetings regarding retention or trial promotion.\n\n3. **Trial Promotion**: For students who do not qualify for promotion due to poor academic performance attributed to learning attitudes or habits rather than ability, there may be an opportunity for trial promotion. These students are required to complete designated summer enrichment courses and meet the school's requirements to be considered for promotion.\n\n4. **Individual Consideration**: The policies emphasize the importance of considering individual student circumstances when making decisions about retention or promotion. This approach aims to set clear academic goals for students and allows those who may be struggling to prepare adequately for future academic challenges.\n\n5. **Summer Programs**: Students who are at risk of retention may be required to attend summer study programs to reinforce their learning and improve their academic performance.\n\nOverall, the retention and promotion policies are designed to ensure that students are adequately prepared for the next level of their education while also providing support for those who may be struggling academically.
