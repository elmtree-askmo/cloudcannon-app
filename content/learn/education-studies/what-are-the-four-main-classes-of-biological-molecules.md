    What are the four main classes of biological molecules?
answer: >-
    The four main classes of biological molecules, also known as macromolecules, are:\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**: These are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1. They serve as a primary energy source and are also important for structural support in cells. Carbohydrates can be classified into three categories:\n   - **Monosaccharides**: Simple sugars like glucose.\n   - **Disaccharides**: Composed of two monosaccharides, such as sucrose.\n   - **Polysaccharides**: Long chains of monosaccharides, such as glycogen and starch.\n\n2. **Lipids**: This class includes a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen. Lipids are crucial for energy storage, forming cell membranes, and serving as signaling molecules. Common types of lipids include:\n   - **Fats and oils**: Used for long-term energy storage.\n   - **Phospholipids**: Major components of cell membranes.\n   - **Steroids**: Involved in signaling and structural functions.\n\n3. **Proteins**: Composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, proteins play a myriad of roles in biological systems, including:\n   - **Enzymes**: Catalysts that speed up chemical reactions.\n   - **Structural proteins**: Provide support and shape to cells and tissues.\n   - **Transport proteins**: Carry substances across cell membranes or throughout the body.\n\n4. **Nucleic Acids**: These are polymers made up of nucleotide monomers. The two main types of nucleic acids are:\n   - **Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)**: Carries genetic information and is responsible for heredity.\n   - **Ribonucleic acid (RNA)**: Plays a role in protein synthesis and gene expression.\n\nEach of these macromolecules is essential for the structure, function, and regulation of living organisms, and they collectively make up the majority of a cell's dry mass.
