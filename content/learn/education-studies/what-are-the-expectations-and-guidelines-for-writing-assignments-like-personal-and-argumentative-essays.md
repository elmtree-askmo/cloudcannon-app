answer: >-
    When it comes to writing assignments, particularly personal and argumentative essays, there are specific expectations and guidelines that students should follow to ensure their work is effective and meets academic standards.\n\n### Personal Essays\n1. **Purpose**: The primary goal of a personal essay is to share personal insights and reflections. These essays aim to connect with the reader on an emotional level, often exploring themes of identity, experience, and personal growth. For example, a personal essay might recount a memorable experience with a pet, focusing on the emotions and lessons learned from that experience.\n\n2. **Style**: Personal essays are typically narrative-driven and introspective. They allow for a more subjective viewpoint, where the author's thoughts and feelings take center stage. The writing style is often informal and conversational, allowing the author to express their voice and personality.\n\n3. **Structure**: While personal essays can be less rigid in structure compared to argumentative essays, they still benefit from a clear organization. A common structure includes an introduction that sets the scene, a body that delves into the experiences and reflections, and a conclusion that ties the insights together.\n\n### Argumentative Essays\n1. **Purpose**: The main objective of an argumentative essay is to convince the reader of a specific viewpoint or stance on an issue. This type of essay seeks to present a compelling argument supported by evidence, aiming to persuade the reader to accept the author's perspective. For instance, an argumentative essay might argue for the ethical treatment of animals, using scientific evidence and ethical reasoning to support its claims.\n\n2. **Style**: Argumentative essays are more formal and structured than personal essays. They require a clear thesis statement that outlines the main argument, followed by supporting evidence and reasoning. The tone is often objective, focusing on facts and logical reasoning rather than personal feelings.\n\n3. **Structure**: A typical structure for an argumentative essay includes:\n   - **Introduction**: Presenting the topic and stating the thesis.\n   - **Body Paragraphs**: Each paragraph should focus on a specific point that supports the thesis, including evidence and counterarguments.\n   - **Conclusion**: Summarizing the main points and reinforcing the thesis, often with a call to action or a reflection on the implications of the argument.\n\n### General Guidelines for Both Types of Essays\n- **Originality**: It is crucial to produce original work and avoid plagiarism. If using AI tools for assistance, students should acknowledge their use to maintain academic integrity.\n- **Critical Thinking**: Both types of essays should demonstrate critical thinking. Personal essays should reflect on experiences thoughtfully, while argumentative essays should analyze and evaluate evidence critically.\n- **Engagement**: Engaging the reader is important in both essay types. Personal essays should evoke emotions, while argumentative essays should challenge the reader's beliefs and encourage them to consider new perspectives.\n\nBy adhering to these expectations and guidelines, students can effectively craft personal and argumentative essays that resonate with their audience and fulfill academic requirements.
