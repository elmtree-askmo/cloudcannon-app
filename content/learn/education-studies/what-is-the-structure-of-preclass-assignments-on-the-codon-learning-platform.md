    What is the structure of pre-class assignments on the Codon Learning Platform?
answer: >-
    The structure of pre-class assignments on the Codon Learning Platform is designed to enhance student engagement and prepare them for in-class discussions. Here are the key components:\n\n1. **Pre-Class Readings**: Students are required to complete readings from designated materials, such as the OpenStats textbook and supplementary PowerPoints or recordings provided online. These readings are foundational for understanding the topics that will be discussed in class.\n\n2. **Pre-Class Questions**: Alongside the readings, students must answer a series of pre-class questions. These questions are crafted to reinforce the material covered in the readings and encourage students to engage with the content actively. The questions can often be answered directly from the readings, promoting comprehension and retention.\n\n3. **Submission Deadlines**: Pre-class assignments are typically due by 9:00 AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This regular schedule helps to maintain a consistent study routine for students.\n\n4. **Weekly Homework**: In addition to pre-class assignments, students are assigned weekly homework through the platform. This usually consists of around 10 questions that review the content covered in class, further solidifying their understanding of the material.\n\n5. **Flipped Classroom Model**: The Codon Learning Platform employs a flipped classroom approach, where students engage with course materials before attending lectures. This model allows for deeper exploration of topics during class time, as students come prepared with a foundational understanding.\n\nOverall, the pre-class assignments on the Codon Learning Platform are structured to promote self-regulated learning and ensure that students are well-prepared for active participation in their biology courses.
