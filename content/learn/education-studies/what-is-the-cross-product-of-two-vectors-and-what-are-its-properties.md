    What is the cross product of two vectors and what are its properties?
answer: >-
    The cross product of two vectors is a fundamental operation in vector algebra, particularly in three-dimensional space. It is denoted by the multiplication sign (Ã—) between two vectors, and the result is a vector that is orthogonal (perpendicular) to both of the original vectors.\n\n### Definition\nGiven two vectors **a** and **b**, the cross product is defined as:\n$$\n\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\n$$\nwhere **c** is the resultant vector.\n\n### Properties of the Cross Product\n1. **Direction**: The resultant vector **c** is perpendicular to the plane formed by vectors **a** and **b**. The direction can be determined using the right-hand rule: if you point your right thumb in the direction of **a** and your fingers in the direction of **b**, your palm will face in the direction of **c**.\n\n2. **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the cross product can be calculated using the formula:\n$$\n|\mathbf{c}| = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \sin(\theta)\n$$\nwhere $ \theta $ is the angle between vectors **a** and **b**. This means that the magnitude is zero if the vectors are parallel (since \( \sin(0) = 0 \)).\n\n3. **Anti-commutativity**: The cross product is anti-commutative, which means:\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})\n$$\nThis property indicates that swapping the order of the vectors changes the direction of the resultant vector.\n\n4. **Distributivity**: The cross product is distributive over vector addition:\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \times (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\n$$\n\n5. **Scalar Multiplication**: If a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the cross product behaves as follows:\n$$\n(k\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b} = k(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\n$$\nwhere $ k $ is a scalar.\n\n6. **Collinearity**: The cross product of two collinear (parallel or anti-parallel) vectors is zero:\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{0} \quad \text{if } \mathbf{a} \text{ and } \mathbf{b} \text{ are collinear.}\n$$\n\n7. **Unit Vectors**: The cross product of two unit vectors that are mutually perpendicular (e.g., **i**, **j**, **k**) results in another unit vector:\n$$\n\mathbf{\hat{i}} \times \mathbf{\hat{j}} = \mathbf{\hat{k}}, \quad \mathbf{\hat{j}} \times \mathbf{\hat{k}} = \mathbf{\hat{i}}, \quad \mathbf{\hat{k}} \times \mathbf{\hat{i}} = \mathbf{\hat{j}}\n$$\n\n### Applications\nThe cross product is widely used in physics and engineering, particularly in calculating torque, angular momentum, and in determining the area of parallelograms formed by two vectors.\n\nIn summary, the cross product is a powerful tool in vector mathematics, providing not only a means to find a vector orthogonal to two given vectors but also offering various properties that facilitate vector calculations in three-dimensional space.
