answer: >-
    Polygenic inheritance is a mode of genetic inheritance where a single phenotypic trait is influenced by the cumulative effects of multiple genes, known as polygenes. This form of inheritance contrasts with Mendelian inheritance, which typically involves traits determined by a single gene or a pair of alleles (dominant and recessive). \n\n### Key Characteristics of Polygenic Inheritance:\n1. **Number of Genes Involved**: Multiple genes contribute to a single trait, leading to a more complex inheritance pattern.\n2. **Phenotypic Variation**: Polygenic traits exhibit continuous variation rather than discrete categories. This means that traits can take on a range of values, rather than being limited to a few distinct forms.\n3. **Environmental Influence**: Polygenic traits can be significantly affected by environmental factors, which can further complicate their expression. This interaction between multiple genes and environmental influences results in a wide range of possible phenotypes.\n\n### Example of Polygenic Inheritance:\nA classic example of polygenic inheritance is human height. Height is influenced by several genes, each contributing a small additive effect to the overall phenotype. For instance, if we consider three genes (A, B, and C), each with two alleles (dominant and recessive), the additive effects of these alleles can be represented as follows:\n\n- Each dominant allele contributes 1 unit to height.\n- Each recessive allele contributes 0 units.\n\nIf an individual has the following genotype:\n- Gene A: AA (2 units)\n- Gene B: Aa (1 unit)\n- Gene C: aa (0 units)\n\nThe total contribution to height from these genes would be:\n$$\n\text{Total Height Contribution} = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 \text{ units}\n$$\n\nIn a population, the combination of different alleles across multiple genes leads to a normal distribution of heights, where most individuals are of average height, while fewer individuals are very short or very tall. This continuous variation is a hallmark of polygenic traits, distinguishing them from Mendelian traits, which typically show clear-cut phenotypic categories. \n\nOverall, polygenic inheritance illustrates the complexity of genetic traits and the interplay between multiple genes and environmental factors in shaping phenotypic outcomes.
