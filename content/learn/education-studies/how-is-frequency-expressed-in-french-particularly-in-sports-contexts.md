    How is frequency expressed in French, particularly in sports contexts?
answer: >-
    In French, frequency is expressed using a variety of adverbs and multi-word expressions that help convey how often an action occurs, particularly in the context of sports. Here are some common adverbs of frequency along with their English equivalents:\n\n1. **Toujours** - always\n2. **Tout le temps** - all the time\n3. **Fréquemment** - frequently\n4. **Souvent** - often\n5. **Régulièrement** - on a regular basis\n6. **Tous les jours** - every day\n7. **Quotidiennement** - daily\n8. **Quelquefois** - sometimes\n9. **De temps en temps** - from time to time\n10. **Parfois** - occasionally\n11. **Rarement** - rarely\n12. **Ne… presque jamais** - almost never\n\nIn addition to these adverbs, French also utilizes multi-word expressions to provide more specific frequency descriptions. For example:\n- **une fois** - once\n- **deux fois** - twice\n- **encore une fois** - one more time\n\nThese expressions can be particularly useful when discussing sports activities. For instance, one might say, "Je fais du sport trois fois par semaine" (I do sports three times a week) or "Je joue au football tous les samedis" (I play football every Saturday).\n\nUnderstanding and using these frequency expressions can greatly enhance your ability to describe routines, habits, and repeated actions in French, especially in the context of sports and physical activities.
