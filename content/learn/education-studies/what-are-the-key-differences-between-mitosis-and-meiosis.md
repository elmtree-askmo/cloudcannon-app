    What are the key differences between mitosis and meiosis?
answer: >-
    Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct processes of cell division in eukaryotic organisms, each serving different purposes and resulting in different outcomes. Here are the key differences between the two:\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Mitosis** is primarily for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. It produces cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.\n   - **Meiosis**, on the other hand, is involved in sexual reproduction and produces gametes (sperm and egg cells) that are genetically diverse.\n\n2. **Number of Divisions**:\n   - **Mitosis** involves one round of cell division, resulting in two daughter cells.\n   - **Meiosis** consists of two rounds of cell division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II), leading to four non-identical daughter cells.\n\n3. **Chromosome Number**:\n   - In **mitosis**, the daughter cells are diploid (2n), meaning they have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. For example, in humans, this is 46 chromosomes.\n   - In **meiosis**, the daughter cells are haploid (n), containing half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. In humans, this results in 23 chromosomes in each gamete.\n\n4. **Genetic Variation**:\n   - **Mitosis** produces genetically identical cells, maintaining the same genetic information as the parent cell.\n   - **Meiosis** introduces genetic variation through processes such as crossing over (genetic recombination) during prophase I and independent assortment of chromosomes, resulting in genetically diverse gametes.\n\n5. **Cell Types**:\n   - **Mitosis** occurs in somatic (body) cells.\n   - **Meiosis** occurs in germ cells, which are involved in the formation of gametes.\n\n6. **Stages**:\n   - Both processes share similar stages (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase), but meiosis has additional stages such as prophase I, where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material.\n\n7. **Cytokinesis**:\n   - In **mitosis**, cytokinesis occurs once at the end of the process, resulting in two daughter cells.\n   - In **meiosis**, cytokinesis occurs twice, once after each of the two divisions, resulting in four daughter cells.\n\nIn summary, while both mitosis and meiosis are essential for life, they serve different functions and produce different types of cells, with mitosis focusing on growth and repair, and meiosis facilitating genetic diversity in sexual reproduction.
