    What are progress alerts, and how can they be used to address academic concerns?
answer: >-
    Progress alerts are notifications issued by faculty members to address specific academic concerns regarding students. These alerts can be triggered by various issues, such as poor attendance, lack of engagement, or declining performance in a course. The purpose of these alerts is to facilitate early intervention and support for students who may be struggling.\n\nProgress reports, on the other hand, are formal assessments of a student's performance that are issued three times during the semesterâ€”typically around the fourth, seventh, and tenth weeks of classes. These reports serve as an intervention strategy, allowing faculty to monitor student progress and identify those who may need additional support. For example, if a professor notices that a student has not been attending classes regularly, they may issue a progress report to alert academic support staff to check in with the student.\n\nBoth progress alerts and reports are essential tools in addressing academic concerns. They provide a structured way for faculty to communicate with students and support services, ensuring that students receive the help they need in a timely manner. When a student receives a progress alert or report, it is encouraged that they reach out to their academic success coach or support staff to discuss the issues raised and develop a plan for improvement. This proactive approach can help students stay on track academically and enhance their overall college experience. \n\nIn summary, progress alerts and reports are integral components of academic success services, enabling early identification of issues and facilitating tailored support for students.
