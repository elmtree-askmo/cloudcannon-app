    Co-dominance in human blood types is exemplified by the ABO blood group system, where alleles IA and IB are both expressed, leading to blood type AB that exhibits characteristics of both A and B antigens.

    How is co-dominance exemplified in human blood types?
answer: >-
    Co-dominance is a genetic phenomenon where both alleles in a heterozygous individual are fully expressed, resulting in a phenotype that displays characteristics of both alleles. In humans, this is exemplified by the ABO blood group system.\n\nIn the ABO blood group system, there are three main alleles: IA, IB, and i. The IA allele codes for the presence of A antigens on the surface of red blood cells, while the IB allele codes for the presence of B antigens. The i allele does not produce any antigens. The inheritance of these alleles follows Mendelian principles, where:\n\n- Individuals with genotype IAIA or IAi have blood type A (expressing A antigens).\n- Individuals with genotype IBIB or IBi have blood type B (expressing B antigens).\n- Individuals with genotype ii have blood type O (no antigens).\n- Individuals with genotype IAIB have blood type AB, which is a classic example of co-dominance. In this case, both A and B antigens are expressed simultaneously on the surface of the red blood cells.\n\nThis co-dominance is significant because it allows for the clear expression of both alleles in the phenotype, leading to the distinct blood type AB, which is neither A nor B but a combination of both. This genetic mechanism illustrates how co-dominance can lead to a diverse range of phenotypes in a population, contributing to genetic variation.
