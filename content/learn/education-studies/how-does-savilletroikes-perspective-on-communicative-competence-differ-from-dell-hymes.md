    How does Saville-Troike's perspective on communicative competence differ from Dell Hymes'?
answer: >-
    Saville-Troike's perspective on communicative competence builds upon and expands the foundational ideas introduced by Dell Hymes, but there are notable differences in their approaches.\n\n1. **Definition and Scope**:\n   - **Dell Hymes**: Hymes introduced the concept of communicative competence in the 1960s, emphasizing that language use is not just about grammatical correctness but also about appropriateness in social contexts. He argued that communicative competence includes knowledge of the social rules governing language use, which he categorized into three units: event (language and text), situation (context), and act (meaning). Hymes' focus was on the interplay between linguistic knowledge and social context, highlighting that effective communication requires understanding both the structure of language and the social norms that dictate its use.\n   - **Muriel Saville-Troike**: In her definition, Saville-Troike (2006) states that communicative competence is what a speaker needs to know to communicate appropriately within a language community. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the dynamics of communication within specific communities, which includes not only linguistic knowledge but also the sociocultural context in which communication occurs. This perspective highlights the role of interaction and the necessity of adapting language use to fit the social environment.\n\n2. **Focus on Interaction**:\n   - **Hymes**: While Hymes acknowledged the importance of context, his work primarily laid the groundwork for understanding communicative competence as a theoretical construct that encompasses both linguistic and social knowledge.\n   - **Saville-Troike**: Saville-Troike places a stronger emphasis on the organization and dynamics of speech within interaction. She argues that communicative competence is not just about knowing the rules but also about engaging in meaningful interactions that reflect the complexities of social relationships and cultural norms. This focus on interaction aligns with her broader interest in sociocultural theory, where the act of communication is seen as a dynamic process influenced by various sociolinguistic factors.\n\n3. **Components of Communicative Competence**:\n   - **Hymes**: His model includes a broader understanding of competence that encompasses various aspects of language use, including the ability to produce and interpret language in context.\n   - **Saville-Troike**: She expands on this by detailing the essential components of communication, which include not only linguistic knowledge but also the ability to navigate social relationships and cultural expectations. This includes understanding who to communicate with, what messages to convey, and how to adapt language to fit different social situations.\n\n4. **Application in Multilingual Contexts**:\n   - **Hymes**: His work laid the foundation for understanding communicative competence in monolingual contexts, but he also acknowledged the complexities introduced by multilingualism.\n   - **Saville-Troike**: She explicitly addresses the differences in communicative competence in monolingual versus multilingual settings, emphasizing the need for individuals to adapt their communication strategies based on their linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This reflects a more nuanced understanding of how language functions in diverse social contexts.\n\nIn summary, while both Hymes and Saville-Troike contribute significantly to the understanding of communicative competence, Saville-Troike's perspective is more focused on the interactional dynamics and sociocultural contexts of communication, expanding the concept to include the complexities of language use in diverse communities.
