    What is the primary goal of expository writing, and how is it typically structured?
answer: >-
    The primary goal of expository writing is to explain, inform, or define a topic clearly and logically without the influence of personal bias. This type of writing is characterized by its objective nature, focusing on delivering factual information rather than persuading the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint.\n\nExpository writing is typically structured in a coherent and organized manner, often following a standard format that includes:\n\n1. **Introduction**: This section introduces the topic and provides a clear thesis statement that outlines the main points to be discussed.\n\n2. **Body Paragraphs**: Each paragraph in the body should focus on a specific aspect of the topic. The structure may vary depending on the subtype of expository writing:\n   - **Descriptive Essays**: Provide detailed descriptions of a subject.\n   - **Definition Essays**: Explain the meaning of a term or concept.\n   - **Compare and Contrast Essays**: Examine the similarities and differences between two or more subjects.\n   - **Cause and Effect Essays**: Analyze the reasons for and the consequences of an event or situation.\n\n   Each body paragraph typically begins with a topic sentence, followed by supporting details, facts, statistics, and examples that reinforce the main idea.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: This section summarizes the key points discussed in the essay and reinforces the thesis statement, providing closure to the reader.\n\nOverall, the structure of expository writing is designed to enhance clarity and understanding, making it easier for the reader to grasp the information presented. Transition words and phrases are often used to ensure coherence and flow between ideas, further aiding in the reader's comprehension.
