    What formalities and rules are usually enforced during final exams?
answer: >-
    During final exams, several formalities and rules are typically enforced to ensure a fair and organized examination process. Here are some of the key regulations that are commonly observed:\n\n1. **Scheduled Examination Period**: Final exams must occur during the designated examination period set by the institution. This is in accordance with academic regulations, and any deviation from this schedule requires prior approval from the appropriate academic committee.\n\n2. **Timeliness**: Students are expected to arrive on time for their exams. If a student arrives more than 15 minutes late, they may not be allowed to take the exam unless they provide a satisfactory explanation to the instructor.\n\n3. **Cancellation and Rescheduling**: Once a final exam is announced, it cannot be canceled. Additionally, the time of the exam cannot be changed after the schedule is published, ensuring that all students are aware of their exam times in advance.\n\n4. **Make-Up Exams**: If a student has three or more exams scheduled on the same day, instructors are required to provide make-up exams for the third and any subsequent exams. Students must notify their instructors about this situation in advance.\n\n5. **Exam Format**: Final exams are typically conducted in a traditional format unless otherwise specified. For example, take-home exams are generally not permitted as final examinations unless specifically approved.\n\n6. **Return of Exam Papers**: Instructors have discretion over whether to return final exam papers to students. If they choose not to return them, the papers must be kept for at least one year for any potential disputes.\n\n7. **Cumulative Assessments**: Final assessments may include not only exams but also final papers or projects, which must be submitted during the official final exam period. Due dates for substantial assignments should align with the scheduled exam time.\n\nThese rules are designed to maintain academic integrity and ensure that all students have a fair opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills during final examinations.
