    What are the best practices for preparing the introduction and conclusion of a speech?
answer: >-
    When preparing the introduction and conclusion of a speech, there are several best practices to consider to ensure they are effective and memorable.\n\n### Introduction Best Practices\n\n1. **Attention-Getter**: Start with a compelling attention-getter to capture the audience's interest. This could be a surprising fact, a powerful quote, or a thought-provoking question. For example, you might say, “Did you know that over 70% of people fear public speaking more than death?”\n\n2. **Thesis Statement**: Clearly state the main point of your speech. This thesis should outline the key points you will discuss, providing a roadmap for your audience.\n\n3. **Preview of Main Points**: Briefly outline the main points you will cover in the body of your speech. This helps the audience know what to expect and prepares them for the information that will follow.\n\n4. **Keep it Concise**: The introduction should be about 10-15% of your total speech time. This ensures that you get to the main content without losing the audience's interest.\n\n### Conclusion Best Practices\n\n1. **Summarize Key Points**: Recap the main points of your speech to reinforce the information presented. This helps the audience remember the key takeaways.\n\n2. **Connect Back to the Introduction**: Bring your speech full circle by referencing the attention-getter or story you used in the introduction. This creates a cohesive experience for the audience.\n\n3. **Call to Action**: If applicable, end with a strong call to action that encourages the audience to take specific steps based on the information you presented. For instance, you might say, “I urge you to write to your congressperson today!”\n\n4. **Leave a Lasting Impression**: The conclusion is your final chance to make an impact. Use a powerful closing statement or quote that resonates with your audience and reinforces your message.\n\n5. **Keep it Brief**: Similar to the introduction, the conclusion should also be about 10-15% of your total speech time, ensuring it is concise and impactful.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can create effective introductions and conclusions that enhance your speech and leave a lasting impression on your audience.
