    What was the role of a 'Stratagos' in ancient Greek city-states?
answer: >-
    In ancient Greek city-states, a 'Stratagos' (στρατηγός) served as a military general. This role was crucial in the context of the city-state's defense and military campaigns. The Stratagos was responsible for leading troops in battle, strategizing military operations, and overseeing the logistics of warfare. \n\nThe position of Stratagos was particularly significant during times of conflict, such as the Peloponnesian War, where effective military leadership could determine the outcome of battles and, by extension, the fate of the city-state. In some city-states, such as Athens, the Stratagos could be elected by the assembly, reflecting a degree of democratic involvement in military leadership. \n\nAdditionally, the Stratagos often held considerable influence not only in military matters but also in political affairs, as military success could enhance their status and power within the city-state. This dual role of military and political leadership underscores the interconnectedness of warfare and governance in ancient Greek society. \n\nOverall, the Stratagos was a pivotal figure in maintaining the security and military prowess of the polis, contributing to the broader political and social dynamics of ancient Greece.
