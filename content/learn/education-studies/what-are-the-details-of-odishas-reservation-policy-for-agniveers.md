answer: >-
    Odisha's reservation policy for Agniveers, announced by Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, includes several key provisions aimed at supporting these short-term military personnel after their service. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Reservation Percentage**: The Odisha government has established a 10% reservation for Agniveers in all Group 'C' and 'D' posts within the state's uniformed services. This reservation is applicable to direct recruitment and is in addition to the existing reservations for ex-servicemen.\n\n2. **Age Relaxation**: Alongside the reservation, there is a provision for a five-year age relaxation for Agniveers seeking employment in uniformed services.\n\n3. **Exemptions**: The policy also includes exemptions from physical tests for ex-Agniveers, making it easier for them to secure positions in the uniformed services.\n\n4. **Scope of Employment**: The reservation applies to various posts, including those in the police, forest guards, fire personnel, and the excise department.\n\n5. **Regulatory Framework**: The Odisha Cabinet has approved the framing of the Odisha Ex-Agniveers (Recruitment to Uniform Services) Rules, 2024, to formalize this reservation policy.\n\nThis initiative is part of a broader effort to recognize and support the contributions of Agniveers, reflecting the government's commitment to enhancing the welfare of military personnel transitioning to civilian roles.
