    What is angular momentum and how is it related to torque?
answer: >-
    Angular momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the rotational motion of an object. It is defined as the product of the moment of inertia ($I$) and the angular velocity ($\omega$) of the object. The formula for angular momentum ($L$) is given by:\n\n$$\nL = I \cdot \omega\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $L$ is the angular momentum,\n- $I$ is the moment of inertia, which depends on the mass distribution of the object relative to the axis of rotation,\n- $\omega$ is the angular velocity, representing how fast the object is rotating.\n\nOne of the key properties of angular momentum is its conservation in a closed system. This means that if no external torques act on the system, the total angular momentum remains constant. A common example illustrating this principle is a figure skater who pulls in their arms while spinning; as they do so, their moment of inertia decreases, and to conserve angular momentum, their angular velocity increases, causing them to spin faster.\n\n### Relationship Between Angular Momentum and Torque\n\nTorque ($\mathbf{M}$) is the measure of the rotational force applied to an object and is related to angular momentum through the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{M} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}\n$$\n\nThis equation states that the torque acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its angular momentum. In simpler terms, if a net torque is applied to an object, it will change the angular momentum of that object over time.\n\nThe torque produced by a force ($\mathbf{F}$) acting at a position vector ($\mathbf{r}$) from the point of rotation is calculated using the vector cross product:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}\n$$\n\nThis relationship shows that torque is dependent on both the magnitude of the force applied and the distance from the pivot point (moment arm), as well as the angle at which the force is applied. The direction of the torque vector is perpendicular to the plane formed by the position vector and the force vector, following the right-hand rule.\n\nIn summary, angular momentum and torque are closely related concepts in rotational dynamics. Torque is responsible for changing the angular momentum of an object, and understanding this relationship is crucial in analyzing rotational motion in various physical systems.
