    What are the volume ranges for P20, P200, and P1000 mechanical pipettes?
answer: >-
    The volume ranges for mechanical pipettes are as follows:\n\n- **P20**: 2 to 20 µL (microliters)\n- **P200**: 20 to 200 µL\n- **P1000**: 100 to 1000 µL\n\nIt is crucial to use the appropriate pipette for the volume being measured to ensure accuracy. For optimal precision, it is recommended to use the smallest pipette that can accommodate the required volume. For example, if you need to measure 20 µL, using a P20 pipette would provide more accurate results than using a P200 pipette. Additionally, setting the pipette outside its specified range can lead to calibration issues and inaccuracies in measurement.
