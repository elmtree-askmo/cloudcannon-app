    For the upcoming quiz/test, the following identification and prohibited items are outlined:\n\n### Identification Required\n- Students must present identification to take the test. This is a standard procedure to ensure the integrity of the assessment process.\n\n### Prohibited Items\n- **Outside Aids**: No outside aids are allowed during the test. This means that students should not bring any materials or resources that could assist them in answering the questions.\n- **Phones**: All phones must be turned off. This is to prevent any form of communication or access to information that could compromise the integrity of the test.\n- **Computer Use**: The computer is to be used solely for writing the test.
