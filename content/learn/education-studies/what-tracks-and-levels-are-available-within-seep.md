answer: >-
    The Student Educational Enrichment Program (SEEP) offers a structured academic enrichment experience tailored for students interested in health professions, particularly those who are underrepresented or disadvantaged. Within SEEP, there are three distinct levels for participants:\n\n1. **Pre-College Level**: This level is designed for high school students, particularly those who are current juniors and seniors or recent graduates. It focuses on foundational knowledge and skills necessary for pursuing a career in health sciences.\n\n2. **Intermediate College Level**: This level is intended for college students who have completed some science prerequisite courses. It builds on the knowledge gained at the Pre-College level and prepares students for more advanced studies in health professions.\n\n3. **Advanced College Level**: This level is for students who have completed more advanced science courses and are preparing for entry into health professional programs. It provides a deeper dive into biomedical sciences and enhances readiness for professional education.\n\nEach track within SEEP is designed to prepare students for future careers in health sciences, emphasizing medicine through a comprehensive academic program that includes courses in various biomedical sciences, networking opportunities, and guest speakers. This structure ensures that participants receive the appropriate level of support and education based on their current academic standing and future aspirations.
