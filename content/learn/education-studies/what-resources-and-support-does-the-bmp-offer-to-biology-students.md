    What resources and support does the BMP offer to biology students?
answer: >-
    The Biology Mentorship Program (BMP) offers a variety of resources and support to biology students, particularly focusing on fostering a supportive and inclusive environment. Here are some key aspects of the program:\n\n1. **Peer Mentoring**: The BMP connects experienced undergraduate Biology majors with freshmen and other students interested in pursuing a degree in Biology. This mentorship helps new students adjust to college life, manage their coursework, and build a community within the Biology department.\n\n2. **Academic Support**: Mentors provide tutoring and support for students enrolled in introductory Biology courses, specifically those taking BISC 160-163. This assistance is crucial for helping students understand course material and succeed academically.\n\n3. **Community Building**: The program aims to create a welcoming environment for students, helping them feel integrated into their biology classes and the broader academic community. This sense of belonging is essential for student retention and success.\n\n4. **Training for Mentors**: Mentors receive training to enhance their effectiveness in supporting their mentees. This training equips them with the skills necessary to guide and assist students in their academic journeys.\n\n5. **Research Opportunities**: The BMP also includes a summer program that allows high school students to explore areas of research interest within biology. This program is free and provides valuable resources for aspiring biologists.\n\n6. **Diversity and Inclusion**: The BMP emphasizes equitable access to STEM education, encouraging participation from underrepresented groups in the biological sciences.\n\nOverall, the BMP serves as a vital resource for biology students, offering both academic and social support to help them thrive in their studies and future careers in the biological sciences.
