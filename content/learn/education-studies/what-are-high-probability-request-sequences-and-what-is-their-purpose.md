answer: >-
    High probability request sequences (HPRS) are a behavioral intervention strategy designed to increase compliance among students, particularly those who may exhibit noncompliant behavior. The primary purpose of HPRS is to create behavioral momentum, which enhances the likelihood that a student will comply with a less preferred or more challenging request after successfully completing a series of easier or preferred tasks.\n\nThe process typically involves presenting two to five easy or known tasks (referred to as high-probability requests) in quick succession before introducing a more difficult or less preferred task (known as a low-probability request). This sequence helps to build momentum and increases the chances that the student will agree to the subsequent request. For example, a teacher might first ask a student to perform simple tasks like "touch your nose" or "clap your hands" before asking them to complete a more challenging assignment.\n\nHPRS is considered a low-intensity, nonaversive intervention that can effectively reduce escape-motivated behavior and improve compliance in educational settings. It is also known by other terms such as interspersed requests, pre-task requests, and behavioral momentum. By strategically using this approach, educators can foster a more cooperative learning environment and support students in overcoming challenges associated with compliance.
