    Which languages have recently been granted classical language status in India?
answer: >-
    Recently, the Indian government has granted classical language status to five languages: Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali. This decision was made by the Union Cabinet, increasing the total number of officially recognized classical languages in India to eleven. \n\nThe languages that were previously recognized as classical include Tamil (2004), Sanskrit (2005), Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008), Malayalam (2013), and Odia (2014). The recognition of these languages aims to preserve and promote their rich cultural heritage, as well as to encourage scholarly research and the revitalization of ancient texts and knowledge systems.\n\nTo qualify for classical language status, a language must meet specific criteria, which include having ancient texts that span 1500 to 2000 years, inscriptional evidence, and a distinct heritage. The addition of Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali reflects the government's acknowledgment of the significant role these languages have played in shaping India's cultural and intellectual landscape.
