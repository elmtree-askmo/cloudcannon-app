    What are the exam requirements for the humanities project?
answer: >-
    The exam requirements for the humanities project typically involve completing a series of courses and a culminating project. Specifically, students must complete six courses to meet the Humanities and Arts degree requirement, which includes five courses plus one concluding project in a chosen area of focus. \n\nThe culminating project is expected to demonstrate exceptional creativity and skill in conceiving, developing, and expressing a theme within any discipline in the humanities and arts. This project is often evaluated for its originality and depth of analysis, and outstanding projects may be recognized with awards, such as the Class of 1879 Prize awarded by the Humanities & Arts department.\n\nAdditionally, students may have the option to fulfill their Humanities and Arts Requirement while enrolled in coursework at an off-campus project center, which includes an inquiry seminar or practicum component. \n\nOverall, the humanities project requires a combination of coursework and a significant final project that showcases the student's understanding and engagement with the humanities.
