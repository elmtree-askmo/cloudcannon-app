    How can one distinguish between a noun and a pronoun in a sentence?
answer: >-
    To distinguish between a noun and a pronoun in a sentence, one can consider the following key differences:\n\n1. **Definition and Function**:\n   - A **noun** is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. It serves as the main subject or object in a sentence. For example, in the sentence "The cat is sleeping," "cat" is a noun.\n   - A **pronoun**, on the other hand, is a word that replaces a noun or noun phrase to avoid repetition. For instance, in the sentence "The cat is sleeping. It is very tired," "It" is a pronoun that replaces the noun "cat."\n\n2. **Antecedent Requirement**:\n   - Pronouns require an antecedent, which is the noun they replace. For example, in the sentence "Sarah loves her dog. She takes it for walks," "She" is a pronoun that refers back to the noun "Sarah," and "it" refers to "dog." Nouns do not require an antecedent.\n\n3. **Usage in Sentences**:\n   - Nouns can stand alone as subjects or objects. For example, "The book is on the table," where "book" is a noun serving as the subject.\n   - Pronouns are used to replace nouns that have already been mentioned or are understood in context. For example, "John is a teacher. He loves his job," where "He" replaces "John."\n\n4. **Identification**:\n   - To identify nouns, look for words that can be preceded by articles (the, a, an) or adjectives. For example, "the tall building" contains the noun "building."\n   - To identify pronouns, look for words that can stand in place of nouns and do not have a specific referent until the noun is mentioned. Examples include "he," "she," "it," "they," and "them."\n\nBy understanding these distinctions, one can effectively differentiate between nouns and pronouns in sentences.
