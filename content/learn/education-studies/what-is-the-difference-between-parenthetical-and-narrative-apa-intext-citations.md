    What is the difference between parenthetical and narrative APA in-text citations?
answer: >-
    In APA style, in-text citations can be categorized into two main types: parenthetical citations and narrative citations. Here’s a detailed explanation of the differences between the two:\n\n### Parenthetical Citations\n- **Format**: In a parenthetical citation, the author's last name and the year of publication are included in parentheses at the end of the sentence or phrase that references the source.\n- **Example**: If you are citing a work by Smith published in 2020, the citation would appear as follows: \n  - (Smith, 2020)\n- **Usage**: This format is often used when the author’s name is not part of the narrative of the sentence, allowing the reader to see the source information at a glance.\n\n### Narrative Citations\n- **Format**: In a narrative citation, the author's last name is incorporated into the text of the sentence, followed by the year of publication in parentheses.\n- **Example**: Using the same author and year, the citation would appear as follows: \n  - Smith (2020) argues that...\n- **Usage**: This format is useful when you want to emphasize the author’s contribution to the discussion or when the author is a key part of the narrative.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Placement**: Parenthetical citations are placed at the end of the sentence, while narrative citations are integrated into the text.\n- **Focus**: Parenthetical citations focus on the source itself, while narrative citations highlight the author’s role in the discussion.\n\nBoth citation styles serve the same purpose of crediting the original source of information but are used in different contexts depending on how the author’s name is presented in the text.
