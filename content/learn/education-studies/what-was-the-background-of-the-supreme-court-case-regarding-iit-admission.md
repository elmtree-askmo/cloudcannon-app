    What was the background of the Supreme Court case regarding IIT admission?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court case regarding IIT admission centered on the plight of Atul Kumar, an 18-year-old Dalit student from Uttar Pradesh. He had successfully cleared the JEE Advanced examination and was allotted a seat in Electronics Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dhanbad. However, he faced a significant setback when he narrowly missed the deadline to pay the admission fee of Rs 17,500, which resulted in the loss of his seat.\n\nThe case was brought before a three-Judge bench comprising Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Justice J B Pardiwala, and Justice Manoj Misra. The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to address the situation, emphasizing the importance of social justice and the need to support deserving candidates from marginalized communities. The court expressed that a talented student like Atul should not be left without opportunities due to a minor administrative lapse.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, the Supreme Court directed IIT Dhanbad to grant admission to Atul Kumar, highlighting the compassionate nature of the ruling and the court's commitment to ensuring that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are not denied their rightful opportunities. This intervention was seen as a significant step in promoting equity in education and addressing systemic barriers faced by students from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
