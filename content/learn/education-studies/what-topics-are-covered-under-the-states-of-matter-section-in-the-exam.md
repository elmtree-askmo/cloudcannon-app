    What topics are covered under the 'States of Matter' section in the exam?
answer: >-
    In the 'States of Matter' section of the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science examination, the following topics are typically covered:\n\n1. **Definition of States of Matter**: Understanding the three primary states of matterâ€”solid, liquid, and gas.\n2. **Properties of States of Matter**: \n   - **Mass**: All states of matter have mass.\n   - **Volume**: Solids have a fixed volume, while liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container, and gases do not have a fixed volume.\n   - **Shape**: Solids have a fixed shape, liquids take the shape of their container, and gases fill the entire volume of their container.\n   - **Compressibility**: Gases can be compressed, while solids and liquids cannot be compressed easily.\n   - **Fluidity**: Liquids and gases can flow, while solids cannot.\n\n3. **Changes in State**: Understanding how matter can change from one state to another (e.g., melting, freezing, condensation, evaporation).\n\n4. **Practical Applications**: Examples of each state of matter in everyday life and their significance.\n\nSample questions may include 'true' or 'false' statements regarding the properties of different states of matter, as indicated in the gathered information. For instance, students might be asked to determine whether solids can be poured or if gases have a fixed shape.\n\nThis overview provides a foundational understanding of the 'States of Matter' topic as it pertains to the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science examination.
