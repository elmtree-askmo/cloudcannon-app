    What are the defining features of a narrative report, and how does it differ from other reports?
answer: >-
    A narrative report is a structured account of events or situations that is often used in professional or academic contexts. Its defining features include:\n\n1. **Objective Focus**: Unlike personal narratives, which may include subjective feelings and reflections, narrative reports concentrate on factual information and objective descriptions. The aim is to inform the reader rather than to entertain or evoke emotions.\n\n2. **Chronological Order**: Narrative reports typically follow a linear and chronological structure, detailing events in the order they occurred. This organization helps the reader understand the sequence of events clearly.\n\n3. **Factual Details**: These reports include specific details about what happened, who was involved, and the outcomes of the events. The emphasis is on clarity and conciseness, ensuring that all necessary information is presented without unnecessary embellishments.\n\n4. **Language and Style**: The language used in narrative reports is straightforward and concise, often employing short sentences to convey information clearly. This contrasts with personal narratives, which may use more elaborate language and longer sentences to create emotional connections.\n\n5. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of a narrative report is to document and communicate information accurately. This can be seen in various contexts, such as incident reports in workplaces or case studies in research.\n\n### Differences from Other Reports\n\n- **Personal Narratives**: Personal narratives aim to entertain and share experiences, often using imaginative language and emotional connections. They may employ literary devices and sensory details, whereas narrative reports focus on factual accuracy and clarity.\n\n- **Research Reports**: While both narrative reports and research reports present information, research reports typically include extensive analysis, methodology, and references to support findings. Narrative reports, on the other hand, are more straightforward and descriptive.\n\n- **Technical Reports**: Technical reports often focus on specific processes or technical information, using specialized language and jargon. Narrative reports are more general and accessible, aimed at a broader audience.\n\nIn summary, narrative reports are characterized by their objective focus, chronological structure, factual details, straightforward language, and informative purpose, distinguishing them from personal narratives and other types of reports.
