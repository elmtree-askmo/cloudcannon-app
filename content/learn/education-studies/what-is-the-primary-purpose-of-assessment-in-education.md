    What is the primary purpose of assessment in education?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of assessment in education is to evaluate and enhance student learning. Assessment serves dual functions: it can promote student learning by providing feedback that helps students understand their strengths and weaknesses, and it can also fulfill accountability requirements by offering evidence of student performance and progress.\n\nEffective assessments are designed to benefit students directly, allowing them to engage with the material and reflect on their understanding. This can be achieved through various assessment methods, including formative assessments, which are ongoing evaluations that inform both teaching and learning, and summative assessments, which evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit.\n\nIn summary, assessments are crucial for guiding educational practices, improving student outcomes, and ensuring accountability within educational systems. They help educators tailor their instruction to meet the needs of their students and provide a framework for measuring educational effectiveness.
