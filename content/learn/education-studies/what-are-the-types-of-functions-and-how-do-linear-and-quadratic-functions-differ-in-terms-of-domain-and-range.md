    What are the types of functions, and how do linear and quadratic functions differ in terms of domain and range?
answer: >-
    In mathematics, functions can be categorized into various types based on their characteristics. Two common types of functions are linear functions and quadratic functions. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of their domain and range:\n\n### Linear Functions\nA linear function is typically expressed in the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = mx + b\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ m $ is the slope of the line,\n- $ b $ is the y-intercept.\n\n#### Domain\nThe domain of a linear function is all real numbers, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Domain: } (-\infty, +\infty)\n$$\n\nThis means that you can input any real number into a linear function.\n\n#### Range\nThe range of a linear function is also all real numbers, expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } (-\infty, +\infty)\n$$\n\nThis is because a linear function can produce any real number as an output depending on the input value.\n\n### Quadratic Functions\nA quadratic function is typically expressed in the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants, and $ a \neq 0 $.\n\n#### Domain\nThe domain of a quadratic function is also all real numbers, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Domain: } (-\infty, +\infty)\n$$\n\nSimilar to linear functions, you can input any real number into a quadratic function.\n\n#### Range\nThe range of a quadratic function depends on the value of $ a $:\n- If $ a > 0 $ (the parabola opens upwards), the range is:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } [k, +\infty)\n$$\n\nwhere $ k $ is the minimum value of the function, which occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n\n- If $ a < 0 $ (the parabola opens downwards), the range is:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } (-\infty, k]\n$$\n\nwhere $ k $ is the maximum value of the function, also occurring at the vertex.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Shape**: Linear functions produce straight lines, while quadratic functions produce parabolas.\n2. **Behavior**: Linear functions have a constant rate of change (slope), while quadratic functions have a variable rate of change that can increase or decrease depending on the input.\n3. **Range**: The range of linear functions is all real numbers, while the range of quadratic functions is limited to values above or below a certain point (the vertex).\n\nIn summary, both linear and quadratic functions have the same domain of all real numbers, but their ranges differ significantly based on their respective forms and coefficients.
