answer: >-
    Within-stimulus prompts are a type of stimulus prompt that help learners make correct discriminations by manipulating specific physical characteristics of the target stimulus. Here are some examples of within-stimulus prompts:\n\n1. **Visual Enhancements**: A common example is altering the appearance of a target stimulus to make it more noticeable. For instance, if a student is learning to identify the letter "B," the letter can be presented in a larger, bolder font or highlighted with a different color to draw attention to it.\n\n2. **Shading or Texturing**: In a scenario where a learner is required to select a specific shape from a group, a clinician might add shading or texture to the target shape. This modification makes the target shape stand out from the others, facilitating easier discrimination.\n\n3. **Embedded Cues**: Within-stimulus prompts can also involve embedding cues directly into the target item. For example, when teaching a child to pronounce the "bbb" sound associated with the letter "B," the letter can be presented with a visual cue, such as a small image of a bee next to it, to reinforce the sound.\n\n4. **Size and Position Adjustments**: Adjusting the size or position of the target stimulus can also serve as a within-stimulus prompt. For example, if a child is learning to identify different colors, the target color can be presented in a larger size compared to other colors, making it easier for the child to focus on it.\n\nThese prompts are designed to be temporary and are typically faded over time as the learner becomes more proficient in making the correct discriminations without the additional cues.
