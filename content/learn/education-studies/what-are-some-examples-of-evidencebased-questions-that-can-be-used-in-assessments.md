    Evidence-based questions are essential in assessments as they help to evaluate understanding and application of knowledge in a structured manner. Here are some examples of evidence-based questions that can be used in various assessment contexts:\n\n1. **Therapeutic Interventions**:\n   - "In patients with osteoarthritis, how does the use of COX-2 inhibitors compare to traditional NSAIDs in terms of pain relief and side effects?"\n   - This question follows the PICO format (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) and encourages students to explore the effectiveness of different treatment options.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Tests**:\n   - "What is the accuracy of MRI compared to X-ray in diagnosing meniscal tears in athletes?"\n   - This question prompts students to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tools and their implications for patient care.\n\n3. **Etiology**:\n   - "What are the risk factors associated with the development of hypertension in elderly populations?"\n   - This question encourages exploration of causative factors and their relevance to patient management.\n\n4. **Prognosis**:\n   - "What is the expected recovery time for patients with a specific type of fracture when treated with surgical intervention versus conservative management?"\n   - This question allows students to analyze outcomes based on different treatment approaches.\n\n5. **Comparative Effectiveness**:\n   - "How do patient outcomes differ between those receiving telehealth consultations versus in-person visits for chronic disease management?"\n   - This question encourages critical thinking about the effectiveness of different healthcare delivery methods.\n\n6. **Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices**:\n   - "What strategies can be employed to increase adherence to evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice?"\n   - This question focuses on the application of evidence in real-world settings and the challenges faced.\n\n7. **Critical Appraisal**:\n   - "How would you assess the quality of a study that claims a new drug reduces the incidence of heart attacks in high-risk patients?"\n   - This question encourages students to think critically about research quality and its implications for practice.\n\nThese examples illustrate how evidence-based questions can be structured to assess knowledge, critical thinking, and application of evidence in clinical scenarios. They can be adapted to various educational contexts, ensuring that assessments are aligned with evidence-based practice principles.
