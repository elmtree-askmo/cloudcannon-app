    Can you provide examples of indefinite pronouns and their usage?
answer: >-
    Indefinite pronouns are an essential part of English grammar, as they refer to non-specific entities, making them versatile in various contexts. Here are some common indefinite pronouns along with examples of their usage:\n\n1. **Anyone**: "Anyone can join the club if they are interested."\n2. **Everyone**: "Everyone enjoyed the concert last night."\n3. **Someone**: "Someone left their umbrella in the hallway."\n4. **No one**: "No one knows the answer to that question."\n5. **Anything**: "You can choose anything from the menu."\n6. **Everything**: "Everything is ready for the party."\n7. **Somebody**: "Somebody needs to take out the trash."\n8. **Nobody**: "Nobody has seen my keys."\n9. **Each**: "Each of the students received a certificate."\n10. **Few**: "Few have the courage to speak out."\n11. **Many**: "Many are called, but few are chosen."\n12. **All**: "All are welcome to attend the meeting."\n13. **Several**: "Several have expressed their interest in the project."\n14. **None**: "None of the options seem appealing."\n15. **Some**: "Some prefer tea over coffee."\n\nIndefinite pronouns can be singular, plural, or both, depending on the context. For example, "all" can be singular when referring to a singular noun (e.g., "All of the cake is gone") or plural when referring to a plural noun (e.g., "All of the students are here"). This flexibility allows for broad and inclusive statements, especially when specific details are unknown or unimportant.
