    Where is the grave accent typically placed in French words?
answer: >-
    In French, the grave accent (accent grave) is typically placed on the following vowels:\n\n1. **On the letter 'e'**: The grave accent is used to indicate that the 'e' should be pronounced as an open sound, as in the word "père" (father). This accent changes the pronunciation from the closed sound of 'e' without an accent.\n\n2. **On the letters 'a' and 'u'**: The grave accent is also used on 'a' and 'u' to differentiate between homophones. For example, "à" (to) versus "a" (has) and "où" (where) versus "ou" (or).\n\nThe placement of the grave accent is crucial for correct pronunciation and meaning in French. It can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of words, depending on the specific word and its syllabic structure. \n\nIn summary, the grave accent is primarily placed on:\n- **'è'** in words like "père"\n- **'à'** in words like "à"\n- **'ù'** in words like "où" \n\nThis accent plays a significant role in phonetics and the differentiation of words in the French language.
