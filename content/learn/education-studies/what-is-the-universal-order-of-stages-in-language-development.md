    What is the universal order of stages in language development?
answer: >-
    The universal order of stages in language development typically follows a predictable sequence as children acquire language. Based on the gathered information, the stages can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Pre-linguistic Stage (0-10 months)**: This stage includes early vocalizations such as crying, cooing, and babbling. Infants communicate through sounds rather than words, and this phase is crucial for developing the ability to produce speech.\n\n2. **Holophrastic Stage (12-18 months)**: During this stage, children begin to use single words (holophrases) to convey whole ideas or meanings. For example, a child might say "milk" to mean "I want milk."\n\n3. **Two-word Stage (18-24 months)**: Children start combining two words to form simple sentences, such as "want cookie" or "go car." This stage marks the beginning of syntax as children begin to understand word order.\n\n4. **Telegraphic Stage (24-30 months)**: In this stage, children use short, simple sentences that often omit less critical words, resembling telegrams. For example, they might say "mommy go" instead of "mommy is going."\n\n5. **Later Multiword Stage (30+ months)**: Children begin to form more complex sentences and use a wider range of vocabulary. They start to grasp grammatical rules and can express more nuanced ideas.\n\n6. **Complex Sentence Stage**: As children continue to develop their language skills, they begin to use complex sentences that include conjunctions and more sophisticated grammatical structures.\n\nThese stages reflect a general progression from simple to more complex language use, and while the ages may vary slightly among individual children, the order of these stages tends to remain consistent across different linguistic communities. Understanding these stages is essential for parents and educators to support language development effectively.
