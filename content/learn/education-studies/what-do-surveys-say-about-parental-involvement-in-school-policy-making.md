    What do surveys say about parental involvement in school policy making?
answer: >-
    Surveys indicate that parental involvement in school policy-making is a significant factor in enhancing children's educational success. Research has consistently shown that active parental engagement—such as participation in school events, parent-teacher conferences, and involvement in decision-making processes—correlates positively with student academic achievement and social-emotional outcomes.\n\nThe Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) Survey, part of the National Household Education Surveys Program, collects data on various aspects of parental involvement, including their participation in school activities and their influence on school policies. Findings from these surveys suggest that parents who are actively involved in their children's education tend to have a better understanding of the school environment and are more equipped to support their children's learning.\n\nMoreover, federal policies like the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) emphasize the importance of parental engagement in education, mandating schools to involve families in decision-making processes. This has led to a recognition among educators and policymakers that parental involvement is crucial for fostering a supportive educational environment.\n\nResearch also highlights that parents with higher levels of social capital—those who are more engaged in school activities—are better positioned to advocate for their children's needs and influence school policies effectively. This engagement can take various forms, from volunteering in classrooms to participating in school governance, which ultimately contributes to improved educational outcomes for students.\n\nIn summary, surveys underscore the vital role of parental involvement in school policy-making, linking it to enhanced academic performance and better overall student well-being.
