    What is the Índex de Dificultat and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    The Índex de Dificultat, or Difficulty Index (ID), is a statistical measure used in educational assessments to evaluate how challenging a specific test item is for a group of learners. It is calculated as the proportion of students who answered the item correctly out of the total number of students who attempted it. \n\nThe formula for calculating the Difficulty Index is:\n\n$$\nID = \frac{C}{T}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $C$ is the number of students who answered the item correctly,\n- $T$ is the total number of students who attempted the item.\n\nFor example, if 80 out of 100 students answered a question correctly, the Difficulty Index would be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nID = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\n$$\n\nThis means that 80% of the students found the item easy, indicating a high Difficulty Index. The Difficulty Index can also be expressed as a percentage, where an ID of 1 (or 100%) indicates that all students answered the item correctly, while an ID of 0 indicates that no students answered it correctly.\n\nIn summary, the Índex de Dificultat provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of test items in assessing student knowledge and skills, helping educators to refine their assessments for better educational outcomes.
