answer: >-
    Subordinating conjunctions are essential components of English grammar that connect dependent clauses to independent clauses, thereby clarifying the relationship between the two. Here are some common subordinating conjunctions:\n\n1. **After** - Indicates that one action occurs later than another.\n   - Example: "After I finish my homework, I will watch TV."\n\n2. **Although** - Used to introduce a contrast or concession.\n   - Example: "Although it was raining, we went for a walk."\n\n3. **As** - Can indicate time or reason.\n   - Example: "As I was leaving, the phone rang."\n\n4. **Because** - Introduces a reason for the action in the main clause.\n   - Example: "I stayed home because I was feeling sick."\n\n5. **Before** - Indicates that one action occurs prior to another.\n   - Example: "I will call you before I leave."\n\n6. **If** - Introduces a condition.\n   - Example: "If it rains, we will stay indoors."\n\n7. **Once** - Indicates that something will happen after a certain point in time.\n   - Example: "Once you finish your project, we can celebrate."\n\n8. **Though** - Similar to "although," it introduces a contrast.\n   - Example: "Though he was tired, he continued working."\n\n9. **Until** - Indicates that something will happen up to a certain point in time.\n   - Example: "I will wait until you arrive."\n\n10. **Whether** - Introduces alternatives or choices.\n    - Example: "I don't know whether to go or stay."\n\nThese conjunctions help create complex sentences that provide additional context, such as time, reason, condition, or contrast, enhancing the clarity and depth of writing.
