    How do piecewise functions and absolute value functions illustrate discontinuous behavior?

    Piecewise functions and absolute value functions are excellent examples of how discontinuous behavior can manifest in mathematical analysis.\n\n### Piecewise Functions\nA piecewise function is defined by different expressions based on the input value. This can lead to various types of discontinuities:\n\n1. **Jump Discontinuities**: A common example of a piecewise function exhibiting a jump discontinuity is:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\ \n   2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   At $x = 0$, the left-hand limit (approaching from the left) is 1, while the right-hand limit (approaching from the right) is 2. Since these two limits are not equal, there is a jump discontinuity at this point.\n\n2. **Removable Discontinuities**: These occur when a function is not defined at a point, but the limits from both sides exist and are equal. For example:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} & \text{if } x \neq 1 \\ \n   3 & \text{if } x = 1 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   The limit as $x$ approaches 1 is 2, but the function is defined as 3 at that point, creating a removable discontinuity.\n\n### Absolute Value Functions\nAbsolute value functions can also illustrate discontinuous behavior, particularly when expressed as piecewise functions. The absolute value function is defined as:\n$$\nf(x) = |x| = \n\begin{cases} \nx & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ \n-x & \text{if } x < 0 \n\end{cases}\n$$\nWhile the absolute value function itself is continuous everywhere, it has a sharp corner at $x = 0$. This point can be analyzed using one-sided limits:\n\n- The left-hand limit as $x$ approaches 0 is 0.\n- The right-hand limit as $x$ approaches 0 is also 0.\n\nHowever, the sharp corner indicates that the derivative does not exist at this point, which is a form of discontinuity in the derivative, even though the function itself is continuous.\n\n### Summary\nBoth piecewise functions and absolute value functions illustrate discontinuous behavior through their definitions and the limits at specific points. Piecewise functions can exhibit jump and removable discontinuities, while absolute value functions, while continuous, can have points where the derivative is not defined due to sharp corners. Understanding these behaviors is crucial for analyzing limits and the overall behavior of functions in calculus.
