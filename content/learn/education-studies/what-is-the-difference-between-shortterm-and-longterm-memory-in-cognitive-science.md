    What is the difference between short-term and long-term memory in cognitive science?
answer: >-
    In cognitive science, short-term memory and long-term memory are two distinct types of memory that serve different functions in the processing and retention of information.\n\n### Short-Term Memory\n- **Duration**: Short-term memory typically holds information for a brief period, usually around 20 to 30 seconds.\n- **Capacity**: It has a limited capacity, often described by Miller's Law as being able to hold about 7Â±2 items (chunks of information).\n- **Function**: Short-term memory is used for temporary storage and manipulation of information. For example, it allows you to remember a phone number long enough to dial it.\n- **Encoding**: Information in short-term memory is encoded primarily through auditory means, although visual and semantic encoding can also occur.\n- **Retrieval**: Accessing information from short-term memory can be effortful, as it often requires active recall.\n\n### Long-Term Memory\n- **Duration**: Long-term memory can store information for extended periods, potentially for a lifetime.\n- **Capacity**: There is no known limit to the amount of information that can be stored in long-term memory.\n- **Function**: Long-term memory is responsible for the retention of information, experiences, and skills over time. It allows for the retrieval of information when needed, often effortlessly.\n- **Types**: Long-term memory can be further divided into explicit (declarative) memory, which includes episodic (personal experiences) and semantic (facts and knowledge) memory, and implicit (non-declarative) memory, which includes skills and conditioned responses.\n- **Encoding**: The process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory often involves rehearsal and the formation of meaningful associations.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Duration**: Short-term memory is temporary (seconds to minutes), while long-term memory is more permanent (days to a lifetime).\n2. **Capacity**: Short-term memory has a limited capacity, whereas long-term memory can store vast amounts of information.\n3. **Retrieval**: Information retrieval from long-term memory is generally more effortless compared to the often active recall required for short-term memory.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for educational research and cognitive science, as it informs strategies for effective learning and memory retention. Techniques such as rehearsal, mnemonic devices, and meaningful associations can enhance the transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory, thereby improving learning outcomes.
