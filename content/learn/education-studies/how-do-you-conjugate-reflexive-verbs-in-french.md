answer: >-
    To conjugate reflexive verbs in French, you need to follow a few key steps. Reflexive verbs, known as *verbes pronominaux* or *réfléchis*, are characterized by the presence of a reflexive pronoun that indicates the action is performed by the subject upon itself. The reflexive pronouns in French are: \n\n- **me** (myself)\n- **te** (yourself, informal)\n- **se** (himself/herself/itself)\n- **nous** (ourselves)\n- **vous** (yourselves, formal or plural)\n- **se** (themselves)\n\n### Present Tense Conjugation\n\n1. **Identify the subject**: Determine who is performing the action.\n2. **Choose the correct reflexive pronoun**: This must match the subject.\n3. **Conjugate the verb**: Change the verb to agree with the subject in person and number.\n\nFor example, the verb *se raser* (to shave) is conjugated in the present tense as follows:\n\n- Je me rase (I shave myself)\n- Tu te rases (You shave yourself)\n- Il/Elle/On se rase (He/She/One shaves himself/herself/oneself)\n- Nous nous rasons (We shave ourselves)\n- Vous vous rasez (You shave yourselves, formal or plural)\n- Ils/Elles se rasent (They shave themselves)\n\n### Passé Composé (Past Tense) Conjugation\n\nTo conjugate reflexive verbs in the passé composé, you need to use the auxiliary verb *être* along with the past participle of the main verb. The reflexive pronoun must also agree with the subject in number and gender. For example:\n\n- Je me suis rasé(e) (I shaved myself)\n- Tu t'es rasé(e) (You shaved yourself)\n- Il s'est rasé (He shaved himself)\n- Elle s'est rasée (She shaved herself)\n- Nous nous sommes rasé(e)s (We shaved ourselves)\n- Vous vous êtes rasé(e)(s) (You shaved yourselves, formal or plural)\n- Ils se sont rasés (They shaved themselves, masculine)\n- Elles se sont rasées (They shaved themselves, feminine)\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, to conjugate reflexive verbs in French, you must:\n- Use the appropriate reflexive pronoun based on the subject.\n- Conjugate the verb according to the subject's person and number.\n- For the passé composé, use *être* as the auxiliary verb and ensure the past participle agrees with the subject.\n\nThis structure allows for clear communication of actions performed by the subject upon themselves, which is a common aspect of daily routines in French.
