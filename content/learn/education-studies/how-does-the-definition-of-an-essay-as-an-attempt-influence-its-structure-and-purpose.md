    How does the definition of an essay as an 'attempt' influence its structure and purpose?
answer: >-
    The definition of an essay as an "attempt" significantly influences both its structure and purpose. This understanding shapes how essays are approached, written, and evaluated.\n\n1. **Purpose of an Essay**: The notion that an essay is an attempt implies that it is not necessarily about arriving at a definitive conclusion. Instead, it is about exploring ideas, posing questions, and engaging in a dialogue with the subject matter. This exploratory nature allows writers to present their thoughts and insights without the pressure of providing absolute answers. For instance, in Tim Kreider's essay, he investigates the consciousness of animals, suggesting possibilities rather than proving them definitively. This aligns with the idea that essays are meant to be provisional and open-ended.\n\n2. **Structure of an Essay**: Given that essays are attempts, their structure often reflects a more fluid and flexible format. While traditional essays may follow a rigid introduction-body-conclusion format, essays that embrace the "attempt" definition may incorporate various components such as personal narratives, reflections, and critical analyses. This structure allows for the inclusion of personal experiences and insights, which can enrich the discussion and make it more relatable to readers. The essay can weave together observations and conclusions that are drawn from the writer's engagement with the topic, rather than adhering strictly to a predetermined outline.\n\n3. **Critical Thinking and Reflection**: The essay as an attempt encourages rigorous thinking and reflection. Writers are prompted to analyze their thoughts critically and consider broader implications of their observations. This critical engagement is essential in college-level writing, where essays often require a deeper exploration of topics rather than surface-level conclusions. The essay becomes a space for intellectual exploration, where the writer can navigate complex ideas and present them in a way that invites readers to think alongside them.\n\n4. **Public Relevance**: Essays that are framed as attempts often address issues that resonate with a wider audience. The insights and observations made in these essays are typically relevant to public discourse, encouraging readers to reflect on their own experiences and beliefs. This relevance is crucial, as it connects the personal with the universal, making the essay a vehicle for shared understanding and dialogue.\n\nIn summary, defining an essay as an "attempt" fundamentally shapes its purpose and structure. It allows for exploration, encourages critical thinking, and fosters a connection with the audience, making the essay a dynamic form of writing that goes beyond mere presentation of facts or arguments.
