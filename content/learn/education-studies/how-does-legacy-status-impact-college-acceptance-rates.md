    How does legacy status impact college acceptance rates?
answer: >-
    Legacy status significantly impacts college acceptance rates by providing preferential treatment to applicants who are related to alumni of the institution. This practice has been shown to reinforce social inequalities and create disparities in admission rates between legacy and non-legacy applicants.\n\n1. **Higher Acceptance Rates for Legacy Applicants**: Legacy applicants often enjoy much higher acceptance rates compared to their non-legacy counterparts. For example, at prestigious institutions like Harvard, legacy applicants have an average admission rate of 33%, which is more than five times higher than that of non-legacy applicants. This disparity illustrates how legacy admissions can perpetuate existing social hierarchies, as legacy applicants typically come from families with substantial financial resources and educational advantages.\n\n2. **Socioeconomic Background**: Approximately 78% of legacy admissions come from the top 10% of household incomes. This statistic indicates that legacy admissions disproportionately benefit affluent applicants, further entrenching social stratification. The majority of legacy applicants are also more likely to be white, with studies showing that 7 out of 10 legacy admissions at Harvard were white in 2019.\n\n3. **Impact on Social Mobility**: The preferential treatment afforded to legacy applicants can hinder social mobility by favoring those who already have access to wealth and educational resources. This creates a cycle where the children of wealthy alumni are more likely to gain admission to elite institutions, thereby maintaining their social status and limiting opportunities for less privileged applicants.\n\n4. **Standardized Test Scores**: Legacy admissions can also translate into significant advantages in standardized testing. On average, legacy applicants may receive a boost equivalent to a 160-point increase on the SAT compared to non-legacy applicants, further skewing the admissions process in favor of those with legacy status.\n\n5. **Institutional Responses**: In recent years, some institutions have begun to reconsider their legacy admissions policies. For instance, Wesleyan University announced its decision to end legacy admissions, citing the unfairness of providing advantages to those who already have significant privileges.\n\nIn summary, legacy status plays a crucial role in college acceptance rates, often leading to higher admission rates for legacy applicants and reinforcing existing social inequalities. This practice raises important questions about fairness and equity in the college admissions process, particularly in the context of broader discussions about socioeconomic diversity and access to higher education.
