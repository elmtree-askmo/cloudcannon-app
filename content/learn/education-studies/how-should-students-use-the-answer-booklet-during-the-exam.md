answer: >-
    During the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science Examination, students should follow these instructions for using the answer booklet effectively:\n\n1. **Index Number**: Students must write their Index Number in the designated space provided in the answer booklet. This is crucial for the identification and grading of their exam.\n\n2. **Writing Instruments**: All answers should be written in the answer booklet using either blue or black ink. It is important to avoid using red ink, as it may not be accepted or could cause confusion during the grading process.\n\n3. **Answering Questions**: Students are required to write all their answers directly in the answer booklet. This includes responses to multiple-choice questions, short answers, and any other formats specified in the exam.\n\n4. **Submission**: At the end of the examination, students must hand in their answer booklet to the supervisor before leaving the examination room. This ensures that all completed work is collected for assessment.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, students can ensure that their examination process is smooth and that their answers are properly recorded and submitted for evaluation.
