    What are the eligibility requirements for the Blue and Gold Opportunity Program?
answer: >-
    The Blue and Gold Opportunity Program is a financial aid initiative offered by the University of California (UC) designed to assist California resident students in covering their systemwide tuition and fees. To be eligible for this program, students must meet the following requirements:\n\n1. **Residency**: Applicants must be California residents.\n2. **Income Limit**: The total family income must be less than $80,000 per year.\n3. **Financial Aid Application**: Students must submit either the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act Application (CADAA) by the priority deadline of March 2 each year. Additionally, a Cal Grant GPA Verification Form may be required.\n4. **Demonstrated Financial Need**: Eligibility is determined based on the student's financial need after considering all other sources of gift aid (grants and scholarships).\n5. **Enrollment Requirements**: Students must meet other campus basic requirements for UC grant aid, such as being enrolled at least half-time during the academic year and maintaining satisfactory academic progress.\n\nIf eligible, students will receive enough financial aid to cover their UC systemwide tuition and fees, ensuring that they do not have to pay these costs out of pocket. The program is particularly beneficial for students during their first four years at UC or two years for transfer students.
