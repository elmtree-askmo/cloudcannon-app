    What is the correct procedure for submitting response sheets after the exam?
answer: >-
    The correct procedure for submitting response sheets after an exam typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Device Usage**: Students must submit their answers using the same device they used for the exam. It is important not to use the device swap feature after the testing time has expired. If students are using a shared device, they should retain that device until they have successfully submitted their answers.\n\n2. **Submission Timeline**: For specific exams, such as AP Exams, it is crucial to submit answers within a designated timeframe, which is typically within 4 days of completing the exam.\n\n3. **Handling Response Sheets**: When filling out response sheets, students should avoid overlapping marks. If a change is necessary, they should carefully erase the initial mark (if allowed) and fill in the correct circle. Additionally, students should handle the response sheets with care to avoid any damage, such as folding or tearing, as a damaged sheet may not be accepted.\n\n4. **Mixing Answer Sheets**: If there are multiple sections or alternate test forms, answer sheets can be mixed as long as the section number is coded on all sheets. It is also important to prepare a key for each form of the test to facilitate accurate grading.\n\n5. **Final Submission**: Once all answers are completed, students should follow the specific instructions provided by the exam proctor or institution for submitting their response sheets, ensuring that all guidelines are adhered to.\n\nBy following these procedures, students can ensure that their response sheets are submitted correctly and are eligible for grading.
