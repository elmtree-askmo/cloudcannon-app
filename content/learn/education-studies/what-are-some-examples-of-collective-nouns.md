    What are some examples of collective nouns?
answer: >-
    Collective nouns are words that refer to a group of individuals, animals, or things treated as a single unit. Here are some examples of collective nouns:\n\n1. **Team** - A team of players\n2. **Herd** - A herd of cattle\n3. **School** - A school of fish\n4. **Flock** - A flock of birds\n5. **Pack** - A pack of wolves\n6. **Pride** - A pride of lions\n7. **Murder** - A murder of crows\n8. **Parliament** - A parliament of owls\n9. **Galaxy** - A galaxy of stars\n10. **Class** - A class of students\n\nThese nouns help to make communication more concise by allowing us to refer to a collection with a single term. For instance, instead of saying "a group of students," we can simply use the collective noun "class." Understanding and using collective nouns correctly can enhance clarity and precision in language.
