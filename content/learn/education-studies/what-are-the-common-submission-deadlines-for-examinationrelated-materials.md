Here are some key points regarding submission deadlines:\n\n1. **Application Deadlines**: For college applications, regular decision deadlines typically fall between January 1 and February 1. It is advisable to submit applications a few days before these deadlines to avoid last-minute issues.\n\n2. **Test Score Submission**: For early action consideration, deadlines for submitting standardized test scores (like SAT or ACT) are often around November 15. For regular decision, the deadline is usually February 1.\n\n3. **Final Entries Deadline**: For various qualifications, a final entries deadline may be set, such as February 21, with recommendations to submit entries at least two weeks prior to this date for review and amendments.\n\n4. **Examination Series Deadlines**: Specific examination series, such as Cambridge IGCSE or A Levels, have their own key dates. For example, the estimated entries deadline for a November series might be set for May 10 of the same year.\n\n5. **Grade Submission Deadlines**: After examinations, there are deadlines for faculty to submit grades, which can vary by institution. For instance, a common deadline for submitting final grades might be December 20 for courses without scheduled final exams.\n\n6. **General Recommendations**: It is generally recommended to keep track of all deadlines and required materials, creating checklists for each school or examination to ensure timely submissions.\n\nThese deadlines are crucial for students to adhere to in order to ensure their applications and examination materials are processed correctly. Always check with the specific institution or examination board for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
