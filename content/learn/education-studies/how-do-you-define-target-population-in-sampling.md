    How do you define target population in sampling?
answer: >-
    The target population in sampling is defined as the entire group of individuals or items that a researcher aims to study and draw conclusions about. It is critical to explicitly define the target population in terms of relevant factors such as demographic characteristics, geographic location, time period, and any other pertinent criteria. This well-defined target population allows for more accurate sampling, data collection, and analysis, ultimately leading to more reliable and valid research findings.\n\nThe target population serves as the total group from which a sample might be drawn, and it is essential for determining the scope of the research. Accurately identifying the target population ensures that the individuals included in the sample are representative of the larger group, which influences the reliability and validity of the findings. \n\nIt is important to note that the target population is distinct from the sampling frame, which is a subset of the target population that serves as the starting point for the sampling process. The sampling frame typically includes individuals or items that are accessible for selection, while the target population encompasses all individuals or items that meet the defined criteria for the study.\n\nIn summary, a well-defined target population is crucial for effective sampling and research, as it directly impacts the quality and applicability of the research outcomes.
