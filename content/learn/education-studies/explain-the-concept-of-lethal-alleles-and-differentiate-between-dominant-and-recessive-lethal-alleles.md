    Explain the concept of lethal alleles and differentiate between dominant and recessive lethal alleles.
answer: >-
    Lethal alleles are specific types of alleles that can lead to the death of an organism when present in a homozygous state. This phenomenon can significantly affect the expected ratios of phenotypes in offspring, as certain genotypes may not survive to maturity. \n\n### Types of Lethal Alleles\n\n1. **Dominant Lethal Alleles**: \n   - These alleles cause death when present in just one copy (homozygous dominant or heterozygous). An example of a dominant lethal allele is the allele responsible for Huntington's disease in humans. Individuals who inherit one copy of the allele will eventually develop the disease, often leading to death before they can reproduce, thus affecting the allele's frequency in the population.\n\n2. **Recessive Lethal Alleles**: \n   - These alleles only cause death when present in a homozygous recessive state. A classic example is the Manx cat, which has a recessive lethal allele that results in the absence of a tail. If two Manx cats (heterozygous for the lethal allele) are crossed, the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring is skewed. Instead of the typical 3:1 ratio seen in Mendelian inheritance, the ratio is approximately 2:1 (with the homozygous recessive individuals not surviving), as the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) leads to embryonic death.\n\n### Impact on Genetic Ratios\nIn a typical Mendelian cross involving a recessive lethal allele, if we denote the dominant allele as "A" (normal) and the recessive lethal allele as "a", a cross between two heterozygous individuals (Aa x Aa) would yield the following expected genotypes:\n- AA (normal)\n- Aa (normal)\n- aa (lethal, does not survive)\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n- 2 normal (AA and Aa) : 1 lethal (aa)\n\nThis results in a 2:1 ratio instead of the expected 3:1 ratio, illustrating how lethal alleles can alter the expected outcomes of genetic crosses.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, lethal alleles can be classified as either dominant or recessive based on their mode of action. Dominant lethal alleles can cause death with just one copy, while recessive lethal alleles require two copies to be lethal. Both types can significantly influence population genetics and the inheritance patterns observed in various organisms.
