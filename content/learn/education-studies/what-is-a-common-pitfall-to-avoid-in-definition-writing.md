    What is a common pitfall to avoid in definition writing?
answer: >-
    A common pitfall to avoid in definition writing is assuming that your readers are familiar with the connotation (the implied meaning) of the term you are defining. This can lead to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity in your writing. It is essential to provide a comprehensive explanation that includes not only the denotation (literal meaning) but also the nuances and context surrounding the term. By doing so, you ensure that all readers, regardless of their prior knowledge, can grasp the full meaning of the concept you are discussing. \n\nAdditionally, it's important to avoid using overly complex or ornate language that may confuse readers rather than clarify the definition. Keeping your language clear and accessible will enhance the effectiveness of your definition writing.
