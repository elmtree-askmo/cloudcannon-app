answer: >-
    Database searching and APA citation will be taught through a structured approach that combines both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. \n\n1. **Database Searching**: \n   - The course will include tutorials focused on information literacy skills, particularly designed for learners who are computer and digitally savvy. These tutorials will cover essential techniques for successful database searching, including how to navigate and select resources available on the library's website. \n   - Students will learn search strategies that yield the most useful results, which is crucial for effective research. This instruction may be integrated into existing courses on digital literacy or information literacy, especially in the context of evidence-based research. \n   - The first module will specifically address the importance of database searching as a foundational step in any research project, emphasizing the need for students to be proficient in locating relevant sources for their writing.\n\n2. **APA Citation**:\n   - The teaching of APA citation will utilize resources such as Academic Writerâ„¢, which is designed to help instructors teach effective writing in APA Style. This tool will provide an in-depth look at the APA citation system, including how to create citations and format references correctly.\n   - Students will learn the author-date format for in-text citations, which is a hallmark of APA style. They will also be instructed on how to cite various types of sources, including books, articles, and websites, ensuring clarity and uniformity in their scholarly work.\n   - The course will cover specific guidelines from the APA Publication Manual (7th edition), including how to cite class notes, lectures, and materials from learning management systems, which is particularly relevant for students in academic settings.\n\nOverall, the combination of database searching skills and APA citation instruction will equip students with the necessary tools to conduct research effectively and present their findings in a professional manner.
