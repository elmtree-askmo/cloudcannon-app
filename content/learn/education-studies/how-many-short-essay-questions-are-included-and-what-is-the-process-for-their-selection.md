    How many short essay questions are included, and what is the process for their selection?
answer: >-
    In the upcoming quiz, there are two short essay questions provided, from which students will choose one to answer. This section is worth a total of twenty marks. The process for selection involves students reading both questions and selecting the one they feel most comfortable addressing. The expectation is that students will respond with a couple of paragraphs, articulating their understanding of the chosen topic clearly and concisely, while also supporting their opinions with reasoning. \n\nThis format allows for a focused assessment of a student's ability to express their thoughts in a structured manner, distinguishing it from longer essays that may require more extensive elaboration.
