    What types of summative assessments are used in the course?
answer: >-
    In the context of a Philippine History course, various types of summative assessments can be employed to evaluate students' understanding and skills at the end of the instructional period. Here are some common formats and examples of summative assessments used in such courses:\n\n1. **Debates**: Students can be divided into groups to debate a proposition related to Philippine history. Each group would argue for or against the proposition, requiring them to provide well-researched arguments and references to support their positions. This format not only assesses their knowledge but also their critical thinking and public speaking skills.\n\n2. **Exams**: Traditional written exams are often used to measure students' retention of knowledge. These can include multiple-choice questions, short answers, and essay questions that cover key themes and events in Philippine history.\n\n3. **Research Papers**: Students may be tasked with writing research papers on specific topics within Philippine history. This allows them to engage deeply with primary and secondary sources, develop their analytical skills, and demonstrate their understanding of historical methodologies.\n\n4. **True/False Assessments**: Simple assessments where students determine the accuracy of statements related to Philippine history can be used. This format is straightforward and can quickly gauge students' understanding of factual information.\n\n5. **Project-Based Assessments**: Students might be assigned projects that require them to create presentations or reports on historical events, figures, or themes. This encourages creativity and allows for a deeper exploration of the subject matter.\n\n6. **Online Assessments**: In a distance learning environment, online assessments such as quizzes, surveys, and interactive activities can be utilized to engage students and assess their learning in a flexible manner.\n\nThese summative assessments are designed to measure the overall learning outcomes of the course and provide feedback to students on their performance in relation to the course objectives.
