    In preparation for the Latin exam, you can expect to be tested on various Latin verb forms, which include:\n\n1. **Conjugations**: Latin verbs are categorized into four conjugations, each indicating variations in person, number, tense, voice, and mood.

You should be familiar with how to form and translate both voices.\n\n4. **Infinitives**: The exam may include questions on various infinitive forms, such as:\n   - Present Infinitive Active\n   - Present Infinitive Passive\n   - Perfect Infinitive Active\n   - Perfect Infinitive Passive\n   - Future Infinitive Active\n   - Future Infinitive Passive\n\n5. **Indirect Statements**: Understanding the structure of indirect statements, which typically involve an accusative subject and an infinitive verb, will also be important. You should be able to recognize and form these constructions.\n\n6. **Principal Parts**: Familiarity with the four principal parts of verbs is crucial, as they provide the basis for conjugating verbs in different tenses and voices.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you will be well-prepared for the types of Latin verb forms that will be tested in your exam.
