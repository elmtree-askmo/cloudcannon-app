    The "Interval de Confianza del Criteri," or confidence interval of the criterion, is a statistical tool used to estimate the range within which a population parameter (such as a mean or proportion) is expected to lie with a certain level of confidence. This interval provides a measure of uncertainty around the estimate derived from sample data.\n\n### Calculation of Confidence Interval\n\nTo calculate a confidence interval, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$)**: This is the average of your sample data.\n2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**: This measures the dispersion of the sample data.\n3. **Find the Sample Size ($n$)**: This is the number of observations in your sample.\n4. **Calculate the Standard Error (SE)**: This is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\n   $$\n5. **Determine the Z-score for the desired confidence level**: For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.\n6. **Calculate the Margin of Error (ME)**: This is calculated as:\n   $$\n   ME = SE \times Z\n   $$\n7. **Establish the Confidence Interval**: The lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval can be calculated as:\n   - Lower Bound = $\bar{x} - ME$\n   - Upper Bound = $\bar{x} + ME$\n\n### Example\n\nFor instance, if you have a sample mean height of 175 cm, a standard deviation of 20 cm, and a sample size of 40, the calculations would be as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the standard error:\n   $$\n   SE = \frac{20}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 3.16\n   $$\n2. Calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence level:\n   $$\n   ME = 3.16 \times 1.96 \approx 6.19\n   $$\n3. Establish the confidence interval:\n   - Lower Bound = $175 - 6.19 \approx 168.81$\n   - Upper Bound = $175 + 6.19 \approx 181.19$\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval for the mean height would be approximately (168.81 cm, 181.19 cm).\n\n### Interpretation\n\nA 95% confidence interval means that if you were to take 20 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 19 of those intervals would contain the true population mean. This does not imply that there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within any specific interval calculated from a single sample, as the true mean is a fixed value.\n\nIn summary, the "Interval de Confianza del Criteri" is a crucial concept in statistics that helps quantify the uncertainty associated with sample estimates, providing a range of plausible values for population parameters.
