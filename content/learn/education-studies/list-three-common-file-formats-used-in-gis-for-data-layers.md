    List three common file formats used in GIS for data layers.
answer: >-
    Three common file formats used in GIS for data layers are:\n\n1. **Shapefile (.shp)**: This is one of the most widely used vector data formats in GIS. A shapefile can store geometric data (points, lines, and polygons) along with associated attribute information, making it suitable for representing various geographic features, such as city boundaries or transportation networks.\n\n2. **GeoJSON**: This format is used for encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). GeoJSON supports point, line, and polygon geometries and is particularly popular for web-based mapping applications due to its lightweight nature and ease of use with web technologies.\n\n3. **KML (Keyhole Markup Language)**: Originally developed for use with Google Earth, KML is an XML-based format for representing geographic data. It allows for the visualization of geographic data in an Earth browser and can include points, lines, polygons, and images.\n\nThese formats facilitate the storage, sharing, and visualization of spatial data in various GIS applications.
