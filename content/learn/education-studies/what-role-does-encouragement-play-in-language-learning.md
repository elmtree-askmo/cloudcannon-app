    What role does encouragement play in language learning?
answer: >-
    Encouragement plays a crucial role in language learning by significantly influencing motivation, which is a key predictor of success in acquiring a new language. Research has shown that motivation and self-efficacy are powerful predictors of language learning outcomes (Alrabai & Moskovsky, 2016; Horwitz, Horwitz, & Cope, 1986). Encouragement, particularly from parents and educators, can foster positive attitudes towards language learning, which in turn enhances learners' motivation to engage with the language.\n\nParental encouragement has been highlighted as particularly significant, especially in the context of ethnic minority learners, where it can facilitate intended learning efforts (Gu & Cheung). This suggests that a supportive environment, where learners feel encouraged, can lead to increased motivation and a greater willingness to participate in language learning activities.\n\nMoreover, the concept of motivation in language learning has evolved, with theories such as DÃ¶rnyei's L2 motivational self-system emphasizing the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Encouragement can serve as an external motivator that helps learners maintain their engagement and commitment to learning, especially when faced with challenges (Liu & Thompson, 2018).\n\nIn summary, encouragement is vital in language learning as it not only boosts motivation but also helps create a positive learning environment that fosters engagement and persistence in language acquisition.
