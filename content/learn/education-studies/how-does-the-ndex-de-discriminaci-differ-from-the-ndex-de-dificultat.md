    How does the Índex de Discriminació differ from the Índex de Dificultat?
answer: >-
    The Índex de Dificultat (ID) and the Índex de Discriminació (D) are two key psychometric indices used in the analysis of test items, particularly in educational assessments. They serve different purposes and provide distinct insights into the quality of test items.\n\n1. **Índex de Dificultat (ID)**: This index measures the difficulty level of a test item. It is calculated as the percentage of learners who answered the item correctly, with values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A lower ID value indicates a more difficult item, while a higher value suggests that the item is easier. For example, if 20 out of 100 students answered a question correctly, the difficulty index would be 0.20, indicating that the item is relatively difficult.\n\n2. **Índex de Discriminació (D)**: In contrast, the discrimination index assesses how well a test item differentiates between high-performing and low-performing students. It is calculated by comparing the proportion of correct responses from the upper-scoring group of students to that of the lower-scoring group. A higher discrimination index indicates that the item effectively distinguishes between students who have mastered the content and those who have not. For instance, if 80% of the high-scoring group answered a question correctly while only 60% of the low-scoring group did, the discrimination index would be 0.20, suggesting that the item has good discriminatory power.\n\nIn summary, while the Índex de Dificultat focuses on how challenging an item is for all students, the Índex de Discriminació evaluates the item's effectiveness in distinguishing between different levels of student performance. Both indices are crucial for ensuring the validity and reliability of assessments, as they help educators understand the quality of their test items and make necessary adjustments.
