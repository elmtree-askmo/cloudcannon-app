    How are piecewise functions constructed, and what is their domain and range?
answer: >-
    Piecewise functions are constructed by defining multiple sub-functions, each applicable to specific intervals of the domain. This allows for different rules or behaviors to be applied in different regions, making piecewise functions particularly useful for representing complex behaviors that cannot be captured by a single function.\n\n### Construction of Piecewise Functions\n\nA piecewise function is typically defined in the following format:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \n\begin{cases} \n\text{formula 1} & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 1 \\ \n\text{formula 2} & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 2 \\ \n\text{formula 3} & \text{if } x \text{ is in domain 3 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\nEach "formula" corresponds to a specific rule that applies to a certain interval of the input variable $x$. For example, consider the following piecewise function:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \n\begin{cases} \nx + 1 & \text{if } x < -2 \\ \n-2x - 3 & \text{if } x \ge -2 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIn this example, the function behaves differently depending on whether $x$ is less than $-2$ or greater than or equal to $-2$.\n\n### Domain and Range\n\n1. **Domain**: The domain of a piecewise function is the union of the subdomains defined by each piece. For the example above, the domain is all real numbers, as the function is defined for all $x$.\n\n2. **Range**: The range of a piecewise function is the union of the ranges of each sub-function over its respective subdomain. To determine the range, one can graph the piecewise function and observe the $y$-values that are covered by the graph. \n\nFor instance, if we analyze the previous example, we can find the range by evaluating the outputs of each piece:\n- For $x < -2$, the output is $x + 1$, which approaches $-1$ as $x$ approaches $-2$ from the left.\n- For $x \ge -2$, the output is $-2x - 3$, which starts at $-1$ when $x = -2$ and decreases without bound as $x$ increases.\n\nThus, the range of this piecewise function would be all real numbers less than or equal to $-1$.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, piecewise functions are constructed by defining multiple formulas for different intervals of the domain. The domain is the union of all intervals where the function is defined, while the range is determined by the outputs of each piece across its respective domain. Graphical analysis can be a helpful tool in identifying both the domain and range of piecewise functions.
