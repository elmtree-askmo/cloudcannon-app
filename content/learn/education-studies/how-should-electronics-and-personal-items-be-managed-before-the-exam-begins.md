answer: >-
    Before the exam begins, managing electronics and personal items is crucial to create a focused and distraction-free environment. Here are the recommended procedures based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Put Away Electronics**: Students should be instructed to remove all electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and smartwatches, from their desks and personal space. This helps minimize distractions and ensures that students can concentrate fully on the exam.\n\n2. **Clear Workspace**: It is important for students to have a tidy and organized workspace. They should be encouraged to clear their desks of any unnecessary items, including personal belongings that are not required for the exam. This contributes to a focused atmosphere and reduces the likelihood of distractions.\n\n3. **Communicate Expectations**: Prior to the exam, clear communication regarding the management of personal items should be established. This includes informing students about the rules regarding electronics and any other items that are prohibited during the exam.\n\n4. **Designated Areas for Personal Items**: If possible, designate a specific area in the classroom where students can place their personal items and electronics. This keeps the exam area organized and helps students remember to put away their belongings.\n\n5. **Reinforce Instructions**: As the exam time approaches, remind students to ensure that all electronics are turned off and stored away. This can be done verbally or through written instructions posted in the exam room.\n\nBy following these procedures, the exam environment can be optimized for concentration and performance, allowing students to focus on their assessments without the interference of personal items or electronic devices.
