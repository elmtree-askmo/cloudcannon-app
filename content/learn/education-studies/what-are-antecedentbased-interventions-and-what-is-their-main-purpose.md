answer: >-
    Antecedent-based interventions (ABIs) are a collection of strategies designed to modify the environment in order to reduce undesirable behaviors, particularly among learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disorders. The main purpose of these interventions is to change the conditions that precede a behavior, thereby decreasing the likelihood of that behavior occurring.\n\nABIs are grounded in the understanding that behaviors are often influenced by environmental factors. By altering these factors, practitioners aim to create a learning environment that encourages positive behaviors while minimizing triggers for challenging behaviors. This approach is typically implemented following a functional behavior assessment (FBA), which helps identify the underlying reasons for the interfering behavior.\n\nThere are two primary categories of antecedent-based interventions:\n\n1. **Default Interventions**: These do not rely on identifying specific variables that maintain the challenging behavior. An example would be environmental enrichment, which enhances the overall environment to promote positive engagement.\n\n2. **Function-Based Interventions**: These rely on identifying and manipulating the functional reinforcers that maintain the behavior. An example of this is Non-Contingent Reinforcement (NCR), where reinforcement is provided independently of the behavior to reduce its occurrence.\n\nOverall, the goal of antecedent-based interventions is to proactively address behaviors by modifying the environment, thus fostering a more conducive learning atmosphere for individuals with ASD and similar challenges.
