    What is the formal definition of a limit in calculus, and how is it notated?
answer: >-
    The formal definition of a limit in calculus describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value. Specifically, the limit of a function \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches a value $ c $ is denoted as:\n\n$$\n\lim_{x \to c} f(x)\n$$\n\nThis notation indicates that we are interested in the value that \( f(x) \) approaches as $ x $ gets arbitrarily close to $ c $. \n\nFor example, if we have a function defined as \( f(x) = 2x \), we can evaluate the limit as $ x $ approaches 3:\n\n$$\n\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6\n$$\n\nIn more formal terms, the limit exists if, as $ x $ approaches $ c $ from both the left (denoted as \( \lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) \)) and the right (denoted as \( \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) \)), the values of \( f(x) \) converge to the same number. If both one-sided limits are equal, we can conclude that the overall limit exists and is equal to that common value.\n\nAdditionally, the epsilon-delta definition of a limit provides a rigorous way to prove the existence of limits. It states that for every $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists a $ \delta > 0 $ such that if $ 0 < |x - c| < \delta $, then \( |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \). This definition emphasizes the precision required in the concept of limits.\n\nIn summary, the notation and definition of limits are foundational concepts in calculus that help us understand the behavior of functions as they approach specific points.
