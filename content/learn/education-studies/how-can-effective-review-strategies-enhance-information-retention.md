    How can effective review strategies enhance information retention?
answer: >-
    Effective review strategies play a crucial role in enhancing information retention by employing techniques that promote active engagement with the material. Here are several key strategies that can significantly improve retention:\n\n1. **Active Recall**: This technique involves actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively reviewing notes. For instance, using flashcards or the cue column in the Cornell note-taking method allows students to test themselves on the material, reinforcing neural connections and improving long-term retention.\n\n2. **Spaced Repetition**: This method involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time. By spacing out review sessions, learners can enhance memory consolidation and retention. Tools like Anki utilize spaced repetition algorithms to optimize review intervals based on individual performance, making it a powerful tool for long-term learning.\n\n3. **Summarization**: Writing summaries in one's own words after a study session helps consolidate information.
