    What are the differences between macronutrients and micronutrients in human nutrition?
answer: >-
    In human nutrition, macronutrients and micronutrients serve distinct but complementary roles, and understanding their differences is crucial for maintaining a balanced diet.\n\n### Macronutrients\n1. **Definition**: Macronutrients are nutrients that the body requires in larger quantities. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n2. **Functions**:\n   - **Energy Source**: Macronutrients provide the primary energy needed for bodily functions. Carbohydrates and proteins yield approximately 4 kcal/g, while fats provide about 9 kcal/g.\n   - **Building Blocks**: They are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. For example, proteins are vital for muscle development and repair.\n   - **Physiological Roles**: Beyond energy, macronutrients play various roles in metabolic processes and are involved in the construction of body composition.\n\n### Micronutrients\n1. **Definition**: Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in smaller amounts. They primarily consist of vitamins and minerals.\n2. **Functions**:\n   - **Supportive Roles**: Micronutrients are crucial for numerous biological processes, including metabolism, immune function, and overall health. They do not provide energy but are essential for the proper functioning of macronutrients.\n   - **Disease Prevention**: Many micronutrients have antioxidant properties that help protect the body against diseases and support growth and development.\n   - **Deficiency Consequences**: Insufficient intake of micronutrients can lead to various health issues, highlighting their importance despite being needed in smaller quantities.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Quantity Required**: Macronutrients are needed in large amounts, while micronutrients are required in trace amounts.\n- **Energy Contribution**: Macronutrients provide energy, whereas micronutrients do not.\n- **Role in Body Composition**: Macronutrients contribute to the construction of body tissues, while micronutrients support metabolic processes and overall health.\n\nIn conclusion, both macronutrients and micronutrients are essential for maintaining health, and a balanced diet should include adequate amounts of both to support bodily functions and prevent deficiencies.
