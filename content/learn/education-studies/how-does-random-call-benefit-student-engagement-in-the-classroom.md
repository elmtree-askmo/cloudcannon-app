answer: >-
    Random call is a classroom management strategy that significantly enhances student engagement by ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in discussions and answer questions. Here are some key benefits of using random call in the classroom:\n\n1. **Inclusivity**: Random call promotes inclusivity by giving every student a chance to contribute, rather than allowing participation to be dominated by a few eager volunteers. This approach helps to create a more balanced classroom environment where diverse perspectives can be shared.\n\n2. **Increased Accountability**: When students know they may be called upon at any time, they are more likely to pay attention and engage with the material. This heightened sense of accountability encourages students to prepare for class and stay focused during discussions.\n\n3. **Formative Assessment**: Random call provides instructors with valuable formative data about student understanding. It allows teachers to gauge the comprehension levels of all students, including those who may be introverted or reluctant to speak up in a traditional setting. This feedback can inform instructional adjustments and help identify areas where students may need additional support.\n\n4. **Encouragement of Active Participation**: The unpredictability of being called on can motivate students to actively participate in discussions. This active engagement is linked to better retention of information and deeper learning, as students are more likely to process and think critically about the material when they are involved in the conversation.\n\n5. **Development of Communication Skills**: Regularly participating in discussions through random call helps students develop their verbal communication skills. It encourages them to articulate their thoughts clearly and respond to questions in a structured manner, which is beneficial for their overall academic and professional development.\n\n6. **Reduction of Anxiety**: For some students, the pressure to volunteer can be anxiety-inducing. Random call can alleviate this pressure by normalizing the experience of being called on, making it a routine part of classroom dynamics.\n\nIn summary, random call is an effective strategy for enhancing student engagement by fostering a more inclusive, accountable, and participatory classroom environment. It not only benefits the instructor by providing insights into student understanding but also supports students in developing essential skills and confidence in their abilities to contribute to discussions.
