    What are the best practices for organizing a works cited page?
answer: >-
    When organizing a Works Cited page in MLA format, there are several best practices to follow to ensure clarity and adherence to the guidelines set forth by the Modern Language Association. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Start on a New Page**: The Works Cited page should begin on a new page after the main text of your paper. If your paper is four pages long, for example, the Works Cited list should start on page five.\n\n2. **Title the Page**: Center the title "Works Cited" at the top of the page. It should not be bolded or italicized.\n\n3. **Alphabetical Order**: List all entries alphabetically by the author's last name. If there is no author, use the title of the work instead. If you have multiple works by the same author, arrange them alphabetically by title.\n\n4. **Formatting**: \n   - Use a one-inch margin on all sides.\n   - Double-space the entire page, including between entries.\n   - Use a hanging indent for each citation, where the first line is flush left and subsequent lines are indented by half an inch.\n\n5. **Citing Different Sources**: Follow the specific format for different types of sources, such as books, articles, and electronic sources. Each type has its own citation structure, which includes elements like the author's name, title of the work, publisher, publication date, and, for online sources, the URL or DOI.\n\n6. **Include URLs and DOIs**: While the MLA Handbook recommends including URLs for online sources, it is advisable to check with your instructor or editor regarding their preferences. For sources with a DOI, include it as it provides a permanent link to the content.\n\n7. **In-Text Citations**: Ensure that your in-text citations correspond to the first element of the Works Cited entry. For example, if the entry begins with the author's name, the in-text citation should include the author's name and the page number.\n\n8. **Special Cases**: If a source has two authors, list both authors in your Works Cited entry. If no author is listed, start with the title. For works with a pseudonym or stage name, follow the guidelines for citing such authors.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, you can create a well-organized and properly formatted Works Cited page that enhances the credibility of your research paper. For more detailed examples and specific citation formats, resources like the Purdue OWL website can be very helpful.
