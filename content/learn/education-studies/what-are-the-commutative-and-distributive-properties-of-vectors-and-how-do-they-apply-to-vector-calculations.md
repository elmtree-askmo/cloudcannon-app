answer: >-
    The commutative and distributive properties of vectors are fundamental concepts in vector algebra that facilitate various vector calculations.\n\n### Commutative Property\nThe commutative property states that the order in which two vectors are added does not affect the resultant vector. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}\n$$\n\nThis property is crucial in vector addition, allowing for flexibility in calculations and simplifying the process of finding resultant vectors.\n\n### Distributive Property\nThe distributive property relates to how scalar multiplication interacts with vector addition. It states that a scalar multiplied by the sum of two vectors is equal to the sum of the scalar multiplied by each vector individually. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nk(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) = k\vec{A} + k\vec{B}\n$$\n\nwhere $ k $ is a scalar. This property is particularly useful when dealing with forces and moments in physics and engineering, as it allows for the simplification of expressions involving multiple vectors.\n\n### Application in Vector Calculations\n1. **Vector Addition**: The commutative property allows for the rearrangement of vectors when calculating the resultant vector, making it easier to visualize and compute.\n2. **Force Analysis**: In mechanical equilibrium problems, the distributive property can be used to break down complex force systems into simpler components, facilitating the analysis of forces acting on a body.\n3. **Projection of Vectors**: When projecting vectors onto axes, the distributive property helps in calculating the components of vectors along different directions.\n\n### Summary\nBoth the commutative and distributive properties are essential for performing vector calculations efficiently. They provide the mathematical foundation for manipulating vectors in various applications, including statics, dynamics, and engineering design. Understanding these properties enhances the ability to analyze and solve problems involving vector quantities effectively.
