    What is the format of questions in the exam structure?
answer: >-
    The exam structure consists of 50 questions, each worth 2 points, totaling 100 points. Additionally, there is an extra credit section that may include 5 to 8 questions, each contributing a quarter of a point. This format emphasizes the main exam questions, which account for the majority of the points. Students are encouraged to manage their time effectively during the exam to ensure they complete the main questions before focusing on the extra credit section.\n\nThe exam will be conducted using a lockdown browser on laptops, and no open notes or electronic devices are allowed during the exam. This structure is designed to assess students' understanding of the material rather than rote memorization.
