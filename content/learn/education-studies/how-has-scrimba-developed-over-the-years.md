    How has Scrimba developed over the years?
answer: >-
    Scrimba has evolved significantly over the years, particularly in its approach to coding education and the technology it employs. Initially, Scrimba focused on providing interactive coding courses and tutorials, but it has since developed into a comprehensive platform that combines video tutorials with interactive coding exercises. This unique format allows learners to practice their skills directly within the course interface, enhancing engagement and retention.\n\nOne of the major milestones in Scrimba's development was the launch of Scrimba v2, which introduced a new and improved platform. This version was a result of collaboration with the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) team, which reviewed and updated Scrimba's main courses to align with MDN's curriculum. This partnership has positioned Scrimba as MDN's recommended course partner, ensuring that its Frontend Developer Career Path adheres to the essential skill set required for new frontend developers.\n\nIn addition to its educational content, Scrimba has also expanded its offerings to include partnerships with industry leaders, such as Cloudflare, to teach developers how to build safe and performant AI applications. This reflects Scrimba's commitment to staying relevant in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n\nThe platform has also introduced features that enhance the learning experience, such as real-time code execution and community engagement tools. These innovations allow learners to interact with the content more dynamically and collaborate with peers, further enriching their educational journey.\n\nOverall, Scrimba's development over the years has been characterized by a focus on interactivity, collaboration with industry experts, and a commitment to providing up-to-date and relevant coding education. This evolution has made it a valuable resource for individuals looking to break into the tech industry and develop their coding skills.
