    Can you provide examples of adjectival phrases and how to identify them?
answer: >-
    An adjectival phrase is a group of words that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun in a sentence. Unlike an adjective phrase, which is typically headed by a single adjective, an adjectival phrase can consist of multiple words that provide additional detail about the noun or pronoun.\n\n### Examples of Adjectival Phrases:\n1. **The book in the corner** - Here, "in the corner" is the adjectival phrase that describes "the book."\n2. **The dog with a wagging tail** - In this case, "with a wagging tail" modifies "the dog."\n3. **The girl wearing a red dress** - The phrase "wearing a red dress" describes "the girl."\n4. **The car that is parked outside** - "That is parked outside" serves as an adjectival phrase modifying "the car."\n5. **The flowers in the garden** - "In the garden" describes the location of "the flowers."\n\n### How to Identify Adjectival Phrases:\nTo identify an adjectival phrase in a sentence, follow these steps:\n- **Look for Nouns or Pronouns**: Start by identifying the nouns or pronouns in the sentence.\n- **Find Descriptive Groups**: Look for groups of words that modify or describe these nouns or pronouns. These groups typically do not contain a subject and verb, distinguishing them from adjectival clauses.\n- **Positioning**: Adjectival phrases can appear before or after the noun they modify. For example, in "The tall man with glasses," "with glasses" is an adjectival phrase that follows the noun "man."\n\nBy recognizing these patterns, you can effectively identify adjectival phrases and understand their role in enhancing the meaning of sentences.
