answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information does not provide specific details regarding the balance between theoretical and practical questions in the Fiji Year 8 Basic Science Examination 2017. There is no mention of the types or proportions of questions included in the exam, which limits the ability to provide a comprehensive response on this aspect.
