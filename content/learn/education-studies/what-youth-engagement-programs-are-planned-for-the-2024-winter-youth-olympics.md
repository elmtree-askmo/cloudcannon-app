    The 2024 Winter Youth Olympic Games, officially known as Gangwon 2024, are set to prioritize youth engagement through various programs and initiatives. Here are some key aspects of the planned youth engagement programs:\n\n1. **Local Youth Activities (LYA)**: The Gangwon 2024 Organising Committee (YOGOC) has developed both online and physical activities aimed at mobilizing and engaging local youth. These activities are designed to encourage participation and foster a sense of community among young people in the region.\n\n2. **Involvement in Planning and Promotion**: Young people have been integrated into the planning and promotional aspects of the Games. This includes contributions to the design of the medal, creation of the mascot, and development of the official song, ensuring that the voices of youth are represented throughout the event.\n\n3. **IOC Young Leaders Program**: A group of IOC Young Leaders will be present at the Games, engaging with young athletes and local youth. They aim to convey the positive impact of sport and physical activity on society, thereby inspiring the next generation.\n\n4. **Athlete Education and Transformation**: The Games will focus on athlete education, providing opportunities for young athletes to learn and grow through their participation. This initiative is part of a broader goal to create a transformative experience for youth involved in the event.\n\n5. **International Participation**: The event will also feature young reporters from various countries, including representatives from the next three Olympic host nations (France, Italy, and Senegal). This initiative aims to provide a platform for youth from diverse backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives.\n\n6. **Cultural and Educational Goals**: The Games are designed to drive positive change and social unity, particularly in the areas of sport, culture, and education. This aligns with the broader ambitions of the Republic of Korea to promote K-culture and address regional isolation.\n\nOverall, the Gangwon 2024 Winter Youth Olympic Games are set to create a lasting legacy for youth engagement, emphasizing the importance of young people's involvement in sports and community activities.
