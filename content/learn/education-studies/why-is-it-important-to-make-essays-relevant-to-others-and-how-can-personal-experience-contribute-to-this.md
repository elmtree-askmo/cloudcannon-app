    Why is it important to make essays relevant to others, and how can personal experience contribute to this?
answer: >-
    Making essays relevant to others is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, essays that resonate with a broader audience foster a sense of connection and shared understanding. When writers address issues that are pertinent to public discourse, they invite readers to reflect on their own experiences and beliefs, creating a dialogue that extends beyond the individual. This relevance not only enhances the impact of the essay but also encourages critical thinking and reflection among readers.\n\nPersonal experience plays a significant role in achieving this relevance. By incorporating personal narratives, writers can illustrate universal themes and insights that many readers may relate to. For example, an essay discussing the emotional support provided by pets can highlight the significance of animal companionship in mental health. This personal anecdote can prompt readers to consider similar relationships in their own lives, thereby bridging the gap between individual experiences and collective understanding.\n\nMoreover, essays framed as attempts often engage in rigorous thinking and reflection, allowing writers to analyze their thoughts critically. This process not only enriches the essay but also encourages readers to engage with complex ideas. When personal experiences are thoughtfully integrated into the essay, they serve as a vehicle for intellectual exploration, making the writing more relatable and impactful.\n\nIn summary, the importance of making essays relevant to others lies in their ability to connect personal insights with universal themes, fostering dialogue and reflection. Personal experiences contribute to this relevance by providing relatable narratives that resonate with a wider audience, ultimately enhancing the essay's effectiveness and encouraging critical engagement.
