    What are the defining features of Post-Impressionism, and how did it build on Impressionism?
answer: >-
    Post-Impressionism is a significant art movement that emerged in the late 19th century as a reaction to Impressionism. While Impressionism primarily focused on capturing the effects of light and color in a spontaneous and momentary manner, Post-Impressionism sought to delve deeper into emotional and symbolic meanings within artworks. Here are the defining features of Post-Impressionism and how it built upon the foundations laid by Impressionism:\n\n### Defining Features of Post-Impressionism\n\n1. **Emotional Expression**: Post-Impressionist artists aimed to convey deeper emotional and psychological states through their work. This was a departure from the more objective observations of Impressionism.\n\n2. **Symbolism and Meaning**: Artists began to incorporate symbolic elements into their compositions, using color and form to express ideas and emotions rather than merely depicting the visual world.\n\n3. **Experimentation with Form and Color**: Post-Impressionists like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, and Georges Seurat experimented with new techniques. For instance, Seurat developed Pointillism, a method of painting with small dots of color that blend at a distance.\n\n4. **Structural Composition**: Unlike the loose brushwork of Impressionism, Post-Impressionists often employed more structured compositions. Cézanne, for example, focused on geometric forms and the underlying structure of objects.\n\n5. **Individual Styles**: The movement is characterized by a diversity of styles and approaches, as each artist sought to express their unique vision. This led to a variety of techniques and aesthetics within the broader Post-Impressionist label.\n\n### Building on Impressionism\n\n- **Foundation of Color and Light**: Post-Impressionism built on the Impressionist emphasis on color and light but expanded it to include emotional resonance. While Impressionists captured the fleeting effects of light, Post-Impressionists used color to evoke feelings and convey meaning.\n\n- **Rejection of Realism**: Both movements rejected the strict realism of earlier art forms, but Post-Impressionists took this further by prioritizing personal expression over the mere representation of reality.\n\n- **Influence on Modern Art**: The innovations of Post-Impressionism paved the way for subsequent movements such as Fauvism and Expressionism, which further explored the emotional and expressive potential of color and form.\n\nIn summary, Post-Impressionism represents a critical evolution in the art world, moving beyond the immediate visual impressions of the Impressionists to explore deeper emotional and symbolic dimensions. This shift not only enriched the artistic landscape of the time but also laid the groundwork for many modern art movements that followed.
