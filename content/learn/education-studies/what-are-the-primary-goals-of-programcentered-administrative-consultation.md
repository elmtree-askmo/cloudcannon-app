answer: >-
    The primary goals of program-centered administrative consultation, as defined by Caplan's framework of mental health consultation, focus on assisting the consultee in effectively administering a treatment or prevention program. This type of consultation is particularly concerned with addressing issues related to the development and management of specific programs within an organization. \n\nKey objectives of program-centered administrative consultation include:\n\n1. **Program Development**: Helping the consultee design and implement new programs or improve existing ones to better meet the needs of clients or the organization.\n\n2. **Administrative Support**: Providing guidance on administrative processes and organizational functioning that can enhance the effectiveness of the program.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving**: Assisting the consultee in identifying and overcoming barriers or challenges that may arise during the implementation of a program.\n\n4. **Capacity Building**: Enhancing the consultee's skills and knowledge related to program management, thereby improving their overall professional functioning.\n\nIn summary, program-centered administrative consultation aims to improve the efficacy of mental health programs by focusing on the administrative and organizational aspects that support their success.
