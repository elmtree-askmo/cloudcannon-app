answer: >-
    The survey and dismantling of the Nubian Temples, necessitated by the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the subsequent creation of Lake Nasser, involved several key steps that were part of an international campaign led by UNESCO. Here are the main steps involved in this process:\n\n1. **Historical Context and Initiation**: The campaign was initiated in response to the imminent flooding of the Nubian region due to the Aswan High Dam. The project aimed to create Lake Nasser, which threatened to submerge numerous ancient temples and monuments.\n\n2. **International Cooperation**: The campaign involved collaboration among over fifty nations, highlighting the global significance of the cultural heritage at risk. This cooperation was crucial for mobilizing resources and expertise necessary for the project.\n\n3. **Funding and Budgeting**: The campaign had a substantial budget of approximately forty million dollars, which was sourced from various international contributions. This financial backing was essential for the extensive work required to survey and relocate the temples.\n\n4. **Archaeological Surveys**: Systematic investigations were conducted to assess the historical and cultural significance of the temples prior to their relocation. These surveys helped in documenting the temples' architectural features and historical context.\n\n5. **Dismantling Process**: The actual dismantling of the temples involved careful deconstruction to preserve their structural integrity. This process required skilled labor and expertise in archaeological preservation techniques to ensure that the temples could be reassembled accurately at their new locations.\n\n6. **Relocation of Temples**: The physical relocation of the temples to new sites was a complex task that raised questions about authenticity and cultural integrity. The temples were reassembled in locations that were deemed safe from flooding, ensuring their preservation for future generations.\n\n7. **Impact on Local Populations**: The campaign also involved the forced relocation of approximately 120,000 Nubian residents, leading to significant cultural and social upheaval. This aspect of the project highlighted the ethical implications of cultural exchange and the impact on Nubian communities.\n\n8. **Legacy and Reflection**: The campaign's legacy continues to influence contemporary cultural politics, as it raises ongoing discussions about the ethics of cultural preservation, the mobility of cultural artifacts, and the political dimensions of architectural conservation.\n\nThese steps reflect a comprehensive approach to cultural heritage management, balancing the need for preservation with the socio-political realities of the time. The Nubian Temples' relocation remains a significant case study in the field of architectural history and cultural restitution.
