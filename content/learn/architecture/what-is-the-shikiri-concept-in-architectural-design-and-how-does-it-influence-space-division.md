    What is the Shikiri concept in architectural design, and how does it influence space division?
answer: >-
    The "Shikiri" concept in architectural design, developed by Emmanuelle Moureaux, focuses on the innovative use of color as a spatial element to evoke emotions and enhance the experience of a space. This philosophy is particularly evident in her work on the Sugamo Shinkin Bank's Ekoda branch, where she transformed the traditional banking environment into a more welcoming and enjoyable setting.\n\nShikiri, which translates to "dividing space with color," emphasizes the idea of using color not just as a decorative element but as a means to create three-dimensional spaces. This approach allows for a more dynamic interaction with the environment, as colors can influence how individuals perceive and navigate through different areas. By layering colors and utilizing them to define spaces, Moureaux effectively creates distinct zones within a larger area, enhancing both functionality and emotional resonance.\n\nIn practical terms, the Shikiri concept influences space division by:\n\n1. **Creating Visual Boundaries**: Color can serve as a visual cue that delineates different functional areas within a space without the need for physical barriers. This can lead to a more open and fluid environment, where users can easily transition between different zones.\n\n2. **Enhancing Emotional Responses**: Different colors can evoke various emotions and feelings. By strategically using color, architects can influence how individuals feel in a space, whether it be calm, energized, or focused.\n\n3. **Encouraging Interaction**: The playful and vibrant use of color can invite users to engage more with their surroundings, fostering a sense of community and interaction, especially in public or commercial spaces.\n\n4. **Layering Spatial Composition**: Moureaux's designs often feature layered compositions that utilize color to create depth and complexity in the spatial experience. This layering can make spaces feel more dynamic and interesting, encouraging exploration.\n\nOverall, the Shikiri concept represents a shift in architectural design philosophy, where color is not merely an aesthetic choice but a fundamental element that shapes the spatial experience and emotional impact of a built environment.
