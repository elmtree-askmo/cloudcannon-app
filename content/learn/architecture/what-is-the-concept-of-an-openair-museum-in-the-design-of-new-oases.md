    What is the concept of an open-air museum in the design of new oases?
answer: >-
    The concept of an open-air museum in the design of new oases, particularly in the context of the relocation of monuments, involves creating a space where historical structures are displayed in a manner that emphasizes their visibility and context. This idea was notably discussed in relation to the oasis of "New Kalabsha," where the design aimed to gather multiple temples on a small island, ensuring that each structure is visible one at a time. This careful calibration of positions allows for a dynamic interaction between the monuments and their surroundings, particularly the Nile, which serves as a significant backdrop.\n\nHowever, the analogy of an open-air museum has been critiqued, especially in the context of preserving the atmosphere of temple precincts. The fifth principle of the design emphasizes that the open-air museum analogy could be harmful, as it risks undermining the unique atmosphere that each temple precinct embodies. Instead of treating the temples as mere exhibits in a museum, the design seeks to maintain their sanctity and original orientation, creating a more immersive experience that reflects the historical and cultural significance of the sites.\n\nThe relocation campaign aimed to isolate the temples to preserve their integrity and authenticity, moving away from the idea of reconstituting a lost Nubian life and instead focusing on the "sanctity of each stone." This approach highlights the importance of maintaining the original context and atmosphere of the monuments rather than presenting them as isolated artifacts in a museum-like setting.\n\nIn summary, while the open-air museum concept suggests a way to display cultural heritage, the design of new oases like New Kalabsha prioritizes the preservation of the original atmosphere and context of the monuments, ensuring that they are experienced in a manner that respects their historical significance.
