    How does SNL utilize celebrity impersonations to enhance its comedic impact?
answer: >-
    "Saturday Night Live (SNL) effectively utilizes celebrity impersonations to enhance its comedic impact in several key ways:\n1. **Exaggeration of Traits**: Celebrity impersonations often involve exaggerating the distinctive traits and behaviors of famous individuals. For example, Will Ferrell's portrayal of George W. Bush is characterized by a humorous overemphasis on Bush's mannerisms and speech patterns. This exaggeration not only entertains but also provides a form of political commentary, allowing audiences to reflect on the real-life implications of these traits.\n2. **Cultural Resonance**: By tapping into the audience's familiarity with celebrities, SNL's impersonations create an immediate connection. Viewers are often well-versed in the public personas of these figures, which makes the comedic portrayals more impactful. The humor resonates because it plays off the audience's existing knowledge and perceptions of the celebrities.\n3. **Political Satire**: SNL has a long history of using celebrity impersonations to comment on political figures and events. Tina Fey's portrayal of Sarah Palin, for instance, not only provided laughs but also sparked discussions about gender and media representation in politics. This use of impersonation helps shape public perception and encourages viewers to think critically about the political landscape.\n4. **Social Commentary**: Beyond mere humor, SNL's sketches often incorporate biting social commentary. For instance, Fey's sketches about Palin highlighted the absurdities of her candidacy and the media's treatment of female politicians. This dual-layered approach—combining humor with serious commentary—allows SNL to engage audiences on multiple levels.\n5. **Parody of Celebrity Culture**: SNL's sketches, such as ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"", parody not only the celebrities themselves but also the culture surrounding them. By portraying celebrities as out-of-touch or lacking intelligence, SNL critiques the superficiality of fame and the absurdity of celebrity culture. This form of satire encourages viewers to reflect on societal norms and the nature of celebrity.\nIn summary, SNL's use of celebrity impersonations enhances its comedic impact by exaggerating traits, resonating with cultural familiarity, providing political satire, offering social commentary, and parodying celebrity culture. This multifaceted approach allows the show to entertain while also prompting deeper reflection on societal issues."
