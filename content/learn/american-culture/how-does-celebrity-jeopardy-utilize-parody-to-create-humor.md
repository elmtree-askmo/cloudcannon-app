    How does 'Celebrity Jeopardy!' utilize parody to create humor?
answer: >-
    "The ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"" sketch from Saturday Night Live (SNL) effectively utilizes parody to create humor by lampooning both the game show ""Jeopardy!"" and the absurdity of celebrity culture. Here are several ways in which this sketch employs parody:\n1. **Characterization of Celebrities**: The sketch features exaggerated portrayals of various celebrities, often highlighting their lack of intelligence or awareness. For instance, characters like Sean Connery (played by Darrell Hammond) and Turd Ferguson (Will Ferrell as Burt Reynolds) are depicted with absurd quirks and humorous misunderstandings of the game, which satirizes the often superficial nature of celebrity personas.\n2. **Absurdity of Fame**: By placing these celebrities in a quiz show setting, the sketch critiques the notion of celebrity status. The contestants' ridiculous answers and antics serve to mock the idea that fame equates to intelligence or competence. This reflects a broader commentary on how society often elevates individuals based on their celebrity rather than their actual abilities or knowledge.\n3. **Host's Frustration**: Will Ferrell's portrayal of Alex Trebek showcases a host who struggles to maintain his composure amidst the chaos. His increasing frustration and attempts to steer the game back on track add to the humor, as it contrasts the serious tone typically associated with the actual ""Jeopardy!"" show. This juxtaposition highlights the absurdity of the situation and enhances the comedic effect.\n4. **Satirical Elements**: The sketch employs satire by using humor, irony, and exaggeration to critique societal norms surrounding fame and celebrity culture. It allows audiences to reflect on the ridiculousness of how celebrities are often treated and perceived, all while being entertained by the outlandish scenarios presented.\n5. **Cultural References**: The sketch is rich in cultural references, drawing on the audience's familiarity with both ""Jeopardy!"" and the celebrities being parodied. This connection enhances the humor, as viewers can appreciate the cleverness of the references and the absurdity of the situations.\nIn summary, ""Celebrity Jeopardy!"" utilizes parody to create humor by exaggerating celebrity characteristics, critiquing the absurdity of fame, showcasing the host's frustration, and incorporating satirical elements that resonate with audiences. This combination results in a memorable and entertaining sketch that reflects on real-world issues while providing comedic relief."
