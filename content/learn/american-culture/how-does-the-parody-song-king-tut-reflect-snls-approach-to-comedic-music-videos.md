    How does the parody song 'King Tut' reflect SNL's approach to comedic music videos?
answer: >-
    "The parody song ""King Tut,"" performed by Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live (SNL), is a quintessential example of the show's approach to comedic music videos. This performance not only showcases Martin's comedic talent but also reflects SNL's broader strategy of blending satire, music, and cultural commentary.\n### Key Aspects of ""King Tut"" and SNL's Approach:\n1. **Satirical Commentary**: ""King Tut"" satirizes the commercialization of ancient history and the fascination with Egyptian culture that was prevalent in the late 1970s. By presenting a humorous take on the historical figure of King Tutankhamun, the sketch critiques how society often trivializes significant cultural artifacts for entertainment purposes. This aligns with SNL's tradition of using parody to comment on contemporary cultural phenomena.\n2. **Musical Performance**: The song is structured as a musical number, complete with choreography and elaborate costumes, which is a hallmark of SNL's comedic music videos. The integration of music into comedy allows for a more engaging and entertaining presentation, making the satire more memorable. This approach has influenced many subsequent comedic acts and shows that blend music with humor.\n3. **Cultural References**: The performance is rich with references to the 1970s pop culture, including the popularity of the King Tut exhibit that toured the United States. By embedding these cultural references, SNL connects with its audience, making the humor more relatable and impactful.\n4. **Character Portrayal**: Steve Martin's portrayal of King Tut is exaggerated and flamboyant, which enhances the comedic effect. This character-driven humor is a staple of SNL, where performers often take on larger-than-life personas to deliver their comedic messages.\n5. **Innovative Storytelling**: ""King Tut"" exemplifies how SNL uses music to tell a story. The lyrics and performance convey a narrative that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, showcasing the versatility of sketch comedy. This innovative storytelling through song has paved the way for other comedic acts, such as The Lonely Island, which further explore the intersection of music and comedy.\nIn summary, ""King Tut"" reflects SNL's unique approach to comedic music videos by combining satire, cultural references, and character-driven humor. This sketch not only entertains but also provokes thought about the commercialization of history, solidifying SNL's reputation as a pioneering force in television comedy."
