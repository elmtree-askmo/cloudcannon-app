    In what ways does the 'Single Ladies' parody on SNL differ from the original performance?
answer: >-
    "The 'Single Ladies' parody on SNL, which first aired on November 15, 2008, differs from the original performance in several notable ways:\n1. **Cast and Presentation**: The SNL sketch features Justin Timberlake, Andy Samberg, and Bobby Moynihan dressed in black leotards and heels, mimicking the choreography of Beyoncé's original music video. This male representation adds a comedic twist, as the original video features a trio of female dancers. The juxtaposition of male performers in traditionally feminine attire creates a humorous contrast that is central to the parody.\n2. **Comedic Elements**: The SNL version incorporates comedic elements that are not present in the original performance. The sketch plays on the absurdity of men performing a dance that is iconic for its femininity, which adds a layer of satire regarding gender roles and expectations in dance and performance.\n3. **Beyoncé's Involvement**: Interestingly, Justin Timberlake revealed that Beyoncé was initially hesitant about the parody. He had to don a leotard and heels to convince her to allow the sketch to happen, highlighting the collaborative yet comedic nature of the SNL performance. This behind-the-scenes story adds context to the parody, showing that it was not just a straightforward imitation but rather a playful homage that required Beyoncé's approval.\n4. **Cultural Commentary**: While Beyoncé's original performance is a celebration of female empowerment and independence, the SNL parody adds a layer of commentary on the cultural phenomenon surrounding the song and its dance. By featuring male performers, the sketch invites the audience to reflect on the cultural significance of the original while also poking fun at the lengths to which people will go to replicate viral trends.\n5. **Musical and Visual Style**: The SNL sketch maintains the catchy tune and choreography of the original but infuses it with exaggerated comedic timing and visual gags that are characteristic of SNL's style. The performance is designed to elicit laughter, contrasting with the polished and serious nature of Beyoncé's original music video.\nIn summary, the SNL parody of 'Single Ladies' differs from the original performance through its use of male performers, comedic elements, Beyoncé's initial reluctance, cultural commentary, and a humorous take on the choreography and music. These differences highlight the unique blend of satire and homage that SNL is known for in its sketches."
