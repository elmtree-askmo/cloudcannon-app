    What are the differences in the portrayal of social class between "Jude the Obscure" and "Jane Eyre"?
answer: >-
    The portrayal of social class in Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure" and Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" presents notable differences, reflecting the authors' distinct perspectives on class dynamics in Victorian society.\n\nIn "Jude the Obscure," Hardy critiques the rigid social stratification of the time through the character of Jude Fawley, who embodies the struggles of a lower-class individual aspiring to rise above his circumstances. Jude's self-education and intellectual aspirations set him apart from his peers, yet he remains perpetually marginalized and unaccepted by the upper class he yearns to join. This duality of living between social worlds amplifies his sense of isolation and highlights the futility of his aspirations, as he is ultimately unable to escape the limitations imposed by his class.\n\nConversely, "Jane Eyre" addresses social class through the lens of gender and the unique position of governesses, who occupy a liminal space in the social hierarchy. Jane, as an orphaned child of ambiguous social standing, faces prejudice and discrimination due to her lower-class origins. However, her moral integrity and strong sense of self allow her to navigate these challenges, ultimately achieving a degree of social mobility through her relationship with Mr. Rochester. Brontë's portrayal of Jane emphasizes resilience and the potential for personal growth, contrasting with Jude's tragic trajectory.\n\nWhile both novels critique the social hierarchies of their time, "Jude the Obscure" presents a more pessimistic view of class mobility and the inherent limitations of social structures, whereas "Jane Eyre" offers a narrative of personal triumph against societal constraints. This difference in portrayal reflects the authors' varying attitudes toward the possibility of overcoming class barriers and the impact of social class on individual identity and relationships.
