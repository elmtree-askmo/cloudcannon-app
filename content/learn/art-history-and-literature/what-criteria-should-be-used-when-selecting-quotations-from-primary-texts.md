    What criteria should be used when selecting quotations from primary texts?
answer: >-
    When selecting quotations from primary texts, several criteria should be considered to ensure that the quotations are relevant, impactful, and effectively support your analysis. Here are the key criteria to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Relevance to Your Argument**: Choose quotations that directly support the main points or arguments you are making in your paper. Ask yourself which point the quotation supports and how it contributes to your overall thesis.\n\n2. **Significance of the Content**: Look for quotations that encapsulate key ideas, arguments, or themes within the text. Quotations that highlight pivotal moments or concepts can provide depth to your analysis.\n\n3. **Author's Language and Style**: Pay attention to the author's word choice, especially if it includes poetic language, symbols, metaphors, or imagery. Quotations that showcase the author's unique style can enhance your analysis and provide insight into their perspective.\n\n4. **Contextual Importance**: Ensure that the quotation is placed within the appropriate context. It should not be isolated but rather integrated into your discussion, making clear how it relates to the surrounding text and your argument.\n\n5. **Length of the Quotation**: Consider the length of the quotation. For quotations longer than four lines, format them as block quotes to maintain clarity and readability. Shorter quotations can be integrated into your text more fluidly.\n\n6. **Interpretative Potential**: Select quotations that are open to interpretation or that present contrasting viewpoints. This allows for deeper analysis and discussion, providing opportunities to compare different ideas or arguments.\n\n7. **Credibility and Authority**: Quotations from well-regarded authors or primary sources lend credibility to your work. Citing authoritative voices can strengthen your argument and demonstrate engagement with established scholarship.\n\n8. **Ethical Considerations**: Always provide proper attribution to the original authors. Citing sources correctly is not only ethically necessary but also allows readers to locate the original material for further study.\n\n9. **Integration into Your Writing**: Ensure that the quotation flows smoothly within your text. Use introductory phrases to introduce the quotation and explain its significance, helping readers understand its relevance to your argument.\n\n10. **Personal Reflection**: As you select quotations, take notes on why you are choosing them. This reflection can aid in developing your analysis and ensuring that you have a clear understanding of how each quotation fits into your overall argument.\n\nBy applying these criteria, you can effectively select quotations that enhance your writing and contribute meaningfully to your analysis.
