    Can you provide examples of alliteration in 'Ode to a Nightingale'?
answer: >-
    In John Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," alliteration is used effectively to enhance the lyrical quality of the poem. Here are some examples of alliteration found in the text:\n\n1. **"drowsy numbness pains"** - The repetition of the 'd' and 'n' sounds creates a soft, flowing rhythm that reflects the speaker's lethargy.\n2. **"hemlock I had drunk"** - The 'h' sound in "hemlock" and "had" emphasizes the gravity of the speaker's experience with poison.\n3. **"leaf-fringed"** - The 'l' sound in "leaf" and "fringed" draws attention to the imagery of nature, which is a central theme in the poem.\n4. **"singing of the nightingale"** - The repetition of the 's' sound in "singing" and "nightingale" enhances the musicality of the line.\n\nThese examples illustrate how Keats employs alliteration to create rhythm and emphasize key themes and emotions within the poem. The use of this literary device contributes to the overall beauty and depth of "Ode to a Nightingale."
