answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis found solace in several books during his childhood, which played a significant role in shaping his literary interests and imagination. Some of the notable works he cherished include:\n\n1. **Gulliver's Travels** by Jonathan Swift - Lewis described this book as one of his favorites, particularly enjoying an unexpurgated and lavishly illustrated edition.\n2. **Beatrix Potter's books** - He appreciated the beauty in Potter's stories, which contributed to his love for fantasy and storytelling.\n3. **Old Punch Magazines** - Lewis spent considerable time poring over an almost complete set of these magazines, particularly enjoying the Sir John Tenniel cartoons.\n\nThese early literary experiences not only provided him with comfort but also influenced his later works, including his own fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis's childhood was marked by a deep engagement with literature, which would later inform his writing and philosophical outlook.
