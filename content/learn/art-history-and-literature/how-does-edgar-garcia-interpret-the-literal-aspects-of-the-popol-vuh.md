    How does Edgar Garcia interpret the literal aspects of the Popol Vuh?
answer: >-
    Edgar Garcia interprets the literal aspects of the *Popol Vuh* through a contemporary lens, particularly in his book *Emergency: Reading the Popol Vuh in a Time of Crisis*. In this work, he presents a series of nine essays that explore the K'iche' Maya creation story, drawing parallels between the themes of the *Popol Vuh* and present-day crises, such as environmental degradation and the challenges faced by migrants.\n\nGarcia's approach is to weave a transhistorical narrative that connects the ancient text to modern emergencies, using nine key words—"birds," "wealth," "caves," "television," "demons," "migrations," "love," "the sun," and "Mormons"—as thematic anchors. He emphasizes that the *Popol Vuh* was written during a time of significant crisis, specifically during the colonial period when European powers were decimating indigenous populations and cultures. This context allows Garcia to argue that the *Popol Vuh* serves not only as a historical document but also as a source of resilience and insight for contemporary societies facing their own crises.\n\nBy examining selected passages from the *Popol Vuh*, Garcia highlights how the text can inform our understanding of emergency and emergence, suggesting that the narratives within it offer valuable lessons on survival and adaptation in times of turmoil. His interpretation encourages readers to rethink their own crises through the lens of this foundational creation story, illustrating the ongoing relevance of the *Popol Vuh* in understanding cultural resilience and identity.
