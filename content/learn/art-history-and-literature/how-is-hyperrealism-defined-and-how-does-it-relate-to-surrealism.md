    How is hyperrealism defined, and how does it relate to surrealism?
answer: >-
    Hyperrealism is defined as an art movement that seeks to create paintings, sculptures, and other artworks that resemble high-resolution photographs, often achieving an extraordinary level of detail and realism that surpasses traditional realism. This style emphasizes meticulous detail and aims to evoke strong emotional responses from viewers by presenting subjects in a way that enhances their visual, social, and cultural aspects. Hyperrealism emerged in the late 20th century, evolving from photorealism, and was notably popularized by artists such as Chuck Close and Ralph Goings.\n\nIn relation to surrealism, hyperrealism and surrealism represent two distinct artistic movements with different objectives. While hyperrealism focuses on creating lifelike representations that blur the lines between reality and photographic precision, surrealism aims for the liberation of the mind by emphasizing the critical and imaginative powers of the subconscious. Surrealism often incorporates dream-like imagery and fantastical elements, challenging perceptions of reality, whereas hyperrealism seeks to enhance and replicate reality in a highly detailed manner.\n\nDespite their differences, there can be an interplay between the two movements. For instance, hyperrealistic techniques can be employed in surrealist works to create a striking contrast between the realistic portrayal of subjects and the fantastical or dream-like contexts in which they are placed. This blending can heighten the emotional impact of surrealist art, making the viewer question the nature of reality and perception.
