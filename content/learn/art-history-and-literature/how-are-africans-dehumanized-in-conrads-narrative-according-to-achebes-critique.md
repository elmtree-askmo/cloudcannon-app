    How are Africans dehumanized in Conrad's narrative according to Achebe's critique?
answer: >-
    Chinua Achebe's critique of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is a significant examination of how Africans are dehumanized within the narrative. In his essay "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness," Achebe articulates several key points that highlight the problematic portrayal of Africa and its people.\n\n1. **Reduction to Objects**: Achebe argues that Conrad's narrative reduces Africans to mere objects within a Eurocentric framework. This portrayal strips them of their individuality and complexity, presenting them as faceless entities rather than as individuals with rich histories and cultures. This reductionist view serves to reinforce colonial stereotypes and ignores the diversity and sophistication of African societies.\n\n2. **Primitive and Barbaric Depictions**: The characters in 'Heart of Darkness' are often depicted as primitive and barbaric, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Achebe emphasizes that this dehumanization not only misrepresents African people but also serves to validate European civilization by contrasting it with an imagined "savage" Africa. This binary reinforces the notion of European superiority and justifies colonial exploitation.\n\n3. **Monolithic Representation**: Achebe critiques the way Africans are presented as a monolithic "other." This portrayal fails to acknowledge the varied cultures, languages, and traditions that exist across the continent. By depicting Africans in such a simplistic manner, Conrad's narrative contributes to a broader cultural imperialism that marginalizes authentic African voices and experiences.\n\n4. **Impact on Literary Legacy**: Achebe's critique calls for a reevaluation of literary legacies that have historically marginalized African perspectives. He advocates for a more nuanced and respectful representation of Africa and its peoples in literature, emphasizing the importance of authentic African narratives that reflect the continent's complexity and richness.\n\nIn summary, Achebe's critique of 'Heart of Darkness' is a powerful condemnation of the racist undertones present in Conrad's work. He highlights the dehumanization of Africans, the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, and the need for a more accurate and respectful representation of African cultures in literature. This critique not only challenges Conrad's narrative but also calls for a broader recognition of the importance of African voices in the literary canon.
