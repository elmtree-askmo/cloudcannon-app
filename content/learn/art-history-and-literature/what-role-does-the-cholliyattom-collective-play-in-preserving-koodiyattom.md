    What role does the Cholliyattom Collective play in preserving Koodiyattom?
answer: >-
    The Cholliyattom Collective plays a significant role in preserving the Koodiyattom art form, which is one of India's oldest living theatrical traditions. Launched in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cholliyattom serves as an informal collective of young Koodiyattom artists in Kerala. Its primary aim is to unite artists from various schools of Koodiyattom, such as Kalamandalam, Ammannur, and Mani Gurukulam, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among them.\n\nThrough initiatives like the Natya Yauvanam-2024 festival, Cholliyattom provides a platform for younger artists to explore and perform different styles of Koodiyattom. This not only helps in preserving the diverse traditions within Koodiyattom but also ensures that the art form continues to thrive for future generations. The collective emphasizes the importance of rigorous training and skill development, which is crucial given that relatively few young people practice Koodiyattom today.\n\nBy bringing together artists and promoting the sharing of techniques and styles, Cholliyattom contributes significantly to the survival and revitalization of Koodiyattom, ensuring that this ancient Sanskrit theatre remains a vibrant part of Kerala's cultural heritage.
