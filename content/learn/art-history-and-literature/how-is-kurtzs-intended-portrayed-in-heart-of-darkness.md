    How is Kurtz's intended portrayed in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," Kurtz's Intended is portrayed as a complex character who embodies the idealized image of civilization and purity, contrasting sharply with the darkness that Kurtz himself represents. She is Kurtz's fiancÃ©e, deeply infatuated with him, and remains in Belgium, clinging to the romanticized notion of his character. The Intended believes she understands Kurtz better than anyone else, viewing him as a man of "promise," "greatness," and a "generous mind," despite the reality of his moral decline and brutality in the Congo.\n\nHer character serves as a symbol of the typical European woman of the time, who is often depicted as naive and oblivious to the harsh realities of colonialism. The Intended's devotion to Kurtz highlights her inability to see beyond the idealized image she has constructed of him, which reflects a broader theme of the novella regarding the illusions of civilization and the moral complexities of imperialism. \n\nWhen Marlow, the protagonist, returns from his journey, he finds the Intended in mourning for Kurtz, dressed in black for over a year, still yearning for information about his last days. This portrayal emphasizes her tragic devotion and the emotional impact of Kurtz's actions, as she remains unaware of the darkness that he has succumbed to. \n\nOverall, Kurtz's Intended represents the intersection of love, illusion, and the consequences of colonialism, serving as a poignant reminder of the disconnect between the ideals of European civilization and the brutal realities of imperialism.
