    How has Noli Me Tangere been received by literary critics over the years?
answer: >-
    "Noli Me Tangere," Jose Rizal's seminal novel, has been the subject of extensive literary criticism since its publication in 1887. The reception of the novel has evolved over the years, reflecting the changing political and cultural landscape of the Philippines and the broader literary world.\n\nInitially, upon its release, "Noli Me Tangere" garnered both praise and criticism. Supporters hailed it as a groundbreaking work that exposed the injustices faced by Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule. Critics, however, labeled it as heretical and anti-Catholic, viewing it as a subversive text that challenged the established order. This dichotomy in reception highlights the novel's provocative nature and its role in igniting discussions about colonialism and social injustice.\n\nLiterary critics have approached "Noli Me Tangere" from various perspectives. For instance, Marxist literary criticism has been employed to analyze the novel's portrayal of oppression and the socio-economic conditions of the time. Critics have noted how Rizal's characters embody the struggles of the Filipino people, illustrating the broader themes of colonialism and social inequality. The novel's impact on Filipino political thought has been profound, influencing both the nationalist movements of the late 19th century and contemporary discussions about identity and culture.\n\nOver the years, "Noli Me Tangere" has been recognized not only for its literary merit but also for its historical significance. It is often regarded as a catalyst for the Philippine Revolution and has inspired countless adaptations in various forms of art, including drama, opera, and film. The novel's themes of social injustice, national consciousness, and the critique of colonialism continue to resonate with readers and scholars alike.\n\nIn summary, the reception of "Noli Me Tangere" has been multifaceted, with literary critics acknowledging its role in shaping Philippine literature and its enduring relevance in discussions about colonialism and social justice. The novel remains a cornerstone of Filipino cultural identity and a vital part of the literary canon.
