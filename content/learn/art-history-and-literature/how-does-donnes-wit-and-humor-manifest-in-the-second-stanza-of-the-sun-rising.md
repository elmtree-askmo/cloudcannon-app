    How does Donne's wit and humor manifest in the second stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the second stanza of John Donne's "The Sun Rising," the poet's wit and humor manifest through his playful and irreverent tone as he addresses the sun. He begins by questioning the sun's authority and relevance, referring to it as a "busy old fool" and "unruly." This characterization is both humorous and mocking, as it diminishes the sun's perceived power and importance in the face of the speaker's love.\n\nDonne employs hyperbole to emphasize the insignificance of the sun compared to the intimacy shared between the lovers. He asserts that the sun should not think it is so powerful, as the speaker's lover's eyes shine brighter than the sun's rays. This clever comparison not only showcases Donne's wit but also elevates the beloved's beauty to a cosmic level, suggesting that their love transcends the natural order.\n\nMoreover, the stanza contains a playful juxtaposition of the sun's role in the world with the personal microcosm of the lovers' bed. The speaker humorously claims that the kings and riches of the world, which the sun has seen, are present in their intimate space, further illustrating the idea that love is more significant than worldly power or authority.\n\nOverall, Donne's use of humor and wit in the second stanza serves to challenge the sun's dominance while celebrating the supremacy of love, making it a quintessential example of his metaphysical style.
