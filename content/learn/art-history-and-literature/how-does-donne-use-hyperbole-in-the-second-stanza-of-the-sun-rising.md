    How does Donne use hyperbole in the second stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the second stanza of John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," hyperbole is employed to emphasize the speaker's perception of love as transcending the ordinary constraints of time and space. The speaker asserts that their love is so significant that it renders the sun's daily journey and the concept of time itself trivial. For instance, the lines "Love, all alike, no season knows, nor clime, / Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time" illustrate this hyperbolic assertion. Here, the speaker exaggerates the idea that love is not bound by the changing seasons or the passage of time, suggesting that these temporal markers are mere "rags" that hold no real value in the face of true love.\n\nAdditionally, the speaker's claim that their love encompasses "all states, and all princes" further exemplifies hyperbole. This exaggeration implies that the lovers' relationship is of such cosmic significance that it overshadows the entire world, including the authority of kings and the vastness of the universe. By using hyperbole in this way, Donne effectively conveys the intensity and all-encompassing nature of love, positioning it as a force that transcends the mundane realities of life.
