    Can you provide a brief biography of Joachim Patinir?
answer: >-
    Joachim Patinir, also known as Patenier, was a prominent Flemish painter born around 1485 in Bouvignes or Dinan, in the region of modern-day Wallonia, Belgium. He passed away on October 5, 1524, in Antwerp, where he spent much of his artistic career. Patinir is recognized as a pioneering figure in the development of landscape painting as an independent genre, making him one of the first Western artists to specialize in this field.\n\nPatinir's work is characterized by its intricate landscapes that often serve as backdrops for religious narratives, particularly biblical scenes. His most famous painting, "Landscape with the Flight into Egypt," created between 1516 and 1517, exemplifies his ability to blend detailed natural settings with historical and religious themes. This painting is housed in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp.\n\nThroughout his career, Patinir was associated with notable contemporaries, including Albrecht DÃ¼rer and Quentin Metsys. He was a member of the St. Luke's Guild in Antwerp, which he joined in 1515. His landscapes are noted for their innovative composition and the way they reflect the emerging modern concept of landscape in Flemish art.\n\nDespite his significant contributions to art, very little is known about Patinir's personal life. He is believed to have been the uncle of fellow painter Herri met de Bles, and his influence can be seen in the works of later artists who followed in his footsteps. Patinir's legacy endures as a foundational figure in the evolution of landscape painting during the Northern Renaissance.
