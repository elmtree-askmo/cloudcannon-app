    How does Keats use simile in 'Ode to a Nightingale'?
answer: >-
    In "Ode to a Nightingale," John Keats employs simile as a literary device to enhance the emotional depth and vivid imagery of the poem. One notable example of simile in the poem is found in the line "The very word is like a bell." This comparison illustrates the profound impact of the word "forlorn," suggesting that it resonates with a haunting clarity, much like the sound of a bell that echoes in the air.\n\nSimiles in Keats's poetry serve to create striking imagery and evoke emotions, allowing readers to connect more deeply with the themes of longing, beauty, and the contrast between mortality and immortality. The use of simile not only enriches the sensory experience of the poem but also emphasizes the speaker's intense yearning to escape the sufferings of life and join the nightingale in its eternal song.\n\nOverall, Keats's use of simile in "Ode to a Nightingale" contributes significantly to the poem's exploration of complex themes, such as the pain of longing and the fleeting nature of beauty, making it a quintessential example of Romantic poetry.
