    What are the key events in John Keats's biography that influenced his poetry?
answer: >-
    John Keats's biography is marked by several key events that significantly influenced his poetry and shaped his literary voice. Here are some of the most impactful moments:\n\n1. **Early Life and Family Tragedies**: Keats was born on October 31, 1795, in London. His father died when Keats was just eight years old, and his mother succumbed to tuberculosis when he was fourteen. These early losses instilled a sense of mortality and transience in Keats, themes that would permeate his poetry.\n\n2. **Education and Medical Training**: Keats initially pursued a career in medicine, attending Guy's Hospital in London. However, he abandoned his medical studies in 1816 to focus on poetry. This transition marked a significant turning point in his life, allowing him to immerse himself in the literary world.\n\n3. **Literary Influences and Friendships**: Keats became part of a vibrant literary circle that included influential figures such as Percy Bysshe Shelley and Charles Lamb. The encouragement and camaraderie he found among these contemporaries helped to refine his poetic style and thematic focus, particularly in exploring nature, beauty, and emotion.\n\n4. **Publication of His First Poems**: In 1817, Keats published his first collection of poems, which received mixed reviews. Despite the criticism, this collection marked the beginning of his journey as a recognized poet and set the stage for his later works.\n\n5. **Health Struggles**: Keats was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1819, a disease that would ultimately lead to his death at the young age of 25. His struggle with illness deeply influenced his poetry, particularly in works like "Ode to a Nightingale," where themes of mortality and the desire for escape through art and beauty are prevalent.\n\n6. **Move to Italy**: In search of a better climate for his health, Keats moved to Rome in 1820. This relocation not only represented a physical escape but also a profound emotional and artistic journey. His time in Italy was marked by the creation of some of his most celebrated works, including "Ode to a Nightingale" and "Ode on a Grecian Urn."\n\n7. **Death and Legacy**: Keats died on February 23, 1821, in Rome, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery. His death prompted tributes from fellow poets, including Shelley's elegy "Adonais." Although he was not widely recognized during his lifetime, Keats's work gained significant acclaim posthumously, influencing generations of poets and becoming a cornerstone of Romantic literature.\n\nThese events collectively shaped Keats's poetic themes, including the interplay of beauty and mortality, the quest for transcendence through art, and the exploration of individual experience against the backdrop of nature.
