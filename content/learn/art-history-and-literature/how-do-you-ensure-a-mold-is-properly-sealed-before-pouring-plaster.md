answer: >-
    To ensure a mold is properly sealed before pouring plaster, follow these essential steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Mold**: Ensure that the mold is clean and dry. Any debris or moisture can interfere with the sealing process and the final cast.\n\n2. **Use a Parting Agent**: Apply a parting agent, such as mold soap or vegetable oil, to the surfaces of the mold. This helps prevent the plaster from sticking to the mold and facilitates easier removal after the plaster has set.\n\n3. **Seal the Mold Edges**: Carefully seal the edges of the mold boards (sides) to prevent any plaster leaks. This can be done using rubber bands or mold straps to hold the mold parts tightly together. If there are small gaps or holes, consider filling them with slip from the outside to create a more secure seal.\n\n4. **Apply a Sealer**: If the mold is made of porous materials like plaster or wood, apply a sealer (such as shellac) to the inside of the mold. This not only helps to prevent moisture from interacting with the plaster but also smooths the surface, reducing the risk of imperfections in the final cast.\n\n5. **Check for Fit**: Before pouring, ensure that all parts of the mold fit together snugly. If there are any misalignments, adjust them to avoid leaks. \n\n6. **Final Inspection**: Conduct a final inspection of the mold to ensure that it is completely sealed and ready for plaster pouring. Look for any visible gaps or areas that may need additional sealing.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively seal your mold, minimizing the risk of leaks and ensuring a successful plaster casting process.
