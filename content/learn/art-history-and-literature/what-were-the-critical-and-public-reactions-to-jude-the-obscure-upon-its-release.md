    What were the critical and public reactions to "Jude the Obscure" upon its release?
answer: >-
    Upon its release in 1895, Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure" provoked a considerable uproar among critics and the public. The initial reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with many reviewers expressing violent denunciations of the novel. Critics objected particularly to its frank portrayal of controversial themes such as marriage, sexual morality, and social norms. The novel's depiction of relationships, including separations, divorces, bigamy, and cohabitation without marriage, was seen as indecent and scandalous for the time.\n\nOne notable review by Jeannette L. Gilder in The New York World described the book as "almost" unworthy of serious consideration, reflecting the general sentiment among contemporary critics. The backlash was so severe that it deeply offended Hardy, leading him to abandon novel writing altogether after the publication of "Jude the Obscure." He cited the frustrating critical reception and his belief that fiction was "a failure" as reasons for this decision.\n\nDespite the initial controversy, "Jude the Obscure" has since been re-evaluated and is now considered a significant work that paved the way for modernist literature, particularly due to its exploration of psychological themes and use of narrative techniques that would later influence the genre. However, the immediate aftermath of its publication was marked by a climate of pained reticence and a reluctance among many publications to engage with the novel's content.
