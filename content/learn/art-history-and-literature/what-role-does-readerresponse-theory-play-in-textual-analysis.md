    What role does reader-response theory play in textual analysis?
answer: >-
    Reader-response theory plays a significant role in textual analysis by emphasizing the active participation of readers in the construction of meaning from literary texts. This approach emerged in the late 1960s and gained prominence in the 1970s and early 1980s as a reaction against New Criticism, which focused primarily on the text itself, its language, structure, and form, often neglecting the reader's role.\n\nAt the core of reader-response theory is the idea that meaning is not fixed or inherent in the text but is created through the interaction between the reader and the text. This perspective allows for a more dynamic understanding of literature, where individual readers bring their personal experiences, emotions, and contexts into their interpretations. As such, readers are seen as active participants rather than passive recipients of meaning.\n\nOne of the key concepts within reader-response theory is transactional analysis, developed by Louise Rosenblatt. This concept posits that meaning arises from the transaction between the reader and the text, suggesting that both elements are essential in the production of meaning. Rosenblatt's work highlights that the reader's engagement with the text can lead to diverse interpretations, reflecting the multiplicity of voices and perspectives that exist within literary analysis.\n\nAdditionally, reader-response theory encourages a subjective approach to criticism, as exemplified by David Bleich's assertion that a reader's response can become the text itself, ripe for analysis. This subjective criticism allows for a broader exploration of how readers interpret texts based on their unique backgrounds and experiences.\n\nIn summary, reader-response theory significantly influences textual analysis by shifting the focus from the author's intentions or the text's inherent qualities to the reader's active role in meaning-making. This approach not only enriches literary interpretation but also empowers readers by validating their personal responses and interpretations as integral to understanding literature.
