    Who were the major writers during the flourishing period of Romanticism?
answer: >-
    During the flourishing period of Romanticism, which emerged in the late 18th century and continued into the 19th century, several major writers made significant contributions to the movement. Key figures include:\n\n1. **William Wordsworth** - Often regarded as a central figure in English Romanticism, Wordsworth, along with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, published *Lyrical Ballads* in 1798, which is considered a landmark work that helped launch the Romantic Age in English literature.\n\n2. **Samuel Taylor Coleridge** - A close collaborator with Wordsworth, Coleridge is known for his lyrical poetry and philosophical writings. His works, such as *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner* and *Kubla Khan*, exemplify the Romantic emphasis on emotion and nature.\n\n3. **John Keats** - Keats is celebrated for his rich imagery and exploration of beauty and mortality in poems like *Ode to a Nightingale* and *Ode on a Grecian Urn*. His work reflects the Romantic ideal of the individual experience and the sublime.\n\n4. **Lord Byron** - A leading figure in the Romantic movement, Byron is known for his passionate and often rebellious poetry, including *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage* and *Don Juan*. His persona as the "Byronic hero" became a defining characteristic of Romantic literature.\n\n5. **Percy Bysshe Shelley** - Shelley was a radical thinker and poet whose works, such as *Ode to the West Wind* and *Prometheus Unbound*, reflect themes of individualism, social justice, and the power of nature.\n\n6. **Mary Shelley** - Although primarily known for her novel *Frankenstein*, which explores themes of creation and the consequences of scientific ambition, Mary Shelley is also an important figure in the Romantic movement, contributing to its exploration of the human condition.\n\n7. **Edgar Allan Poe** - An influential American writer, Poe's works, including *The Raven* and *The Tell-Tale Heart*, embody the Romantic fascination with the macabre and the exploration of the human psyche.\n\n8. **The Brontë Sisters** - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë made significant contributions to Romantic literature with novels such as *Jane Eyre* (Charlotte) and *Wuthering Heights* (Emily), which delve into themes of passion, isolation, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n9. **Victor Hugo** - A prominent French writer, Hugo's works, including *Les Misérables* and *The Hunchback of Notre-Dame*, reflect the Romantic ideals of individualism and social justice, as well as a deep appreciation for nature and the human spirit.\n\n10. **Johann Wolfgang von Goethe** - A key figure in German Romanticism, Goethe's works, particularly *The Sorrows of Young Werther*, had a profound influence on the movement, addressing themes of unrequited love and the struggles of the individual.\n\nThese writers, among others, played a crucial role in shaping the themes and characteristics of Romanticism, which emphasized emotion, nature, individualism, and the sublime.
