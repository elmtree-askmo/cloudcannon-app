    How does the falling action resolve the novel's central conflicts?
answer: >-
    In "Jude the Obscure," the falling action serves to resolve the central conflicts primarily through the tragic outcomes of the main characters, Jude and Sue. As the narrative progresses towards its conclusion, the complexities of their relationships and the societal constraints they face culminate in a series of devastating events that highlight the futility of their aspirations.\n\nThe falling action begins after the climax, where Jude and Sue's attempts to forge a life together are thwarted by societal expectations and personal failures. Jude's legal divorce from Arabella and Sue's tumultuous relationship with Phillotson illustrate the constraints of marriage and the hypocrisy surrounding it. Their struggles reflect Hardy's critique of the institution of marriage, which he portrays as flawed and unjust. This critique is central to the novel, as both Jude and Sue find themselves trapped in circumstances that lead to regret and despair.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the characters experience profound loss and disillusionment. Jude's dreams of becoming an educated man and achieving a better life are crushed by societal limitations and personal tragedies, including the death of their children. Sue's eventual withdrawal from Jude, driven by her own fears and societal pressures, further emphasizes the theme of isolation and the impossibility of escaping societal norms.\n\nThe resolution of the novel's conflicts is marked by a sense of fatalism, as both Jude and Sue are unable to escape the "tragic machinery" of their lives. Their aspirations are ultimately rendered futile, and the narrative closes on a somber note, underscoring the themes of class limitations, religious doubt, and the constraints of marriage. This falling action not only resolves the personal conflicts between the characters but also reinforces Hardy's broader commentary on the struggles of individuals against the rigid structures of society.
