    What is the design of the medals for the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics?
answer: >-
    The design of the medals for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris is notable for its incorporation of a piece of iron originally intended for the Eiffel Tower. This iron has been cut into the shape of a hexagon and will serve as a centerpiece for each medal. This marks the first time in Olympic history that a jeweler, specifically Chaumet, has been entrusted with the design of the medals, reflecting a blend of artistry and tradition.\n\nThe medals will feature a shared design on one side, which includes the hexagonal centerpiece made from the Eiffel Tower iron. Surrounding this centerpiece are embossed lines that resemble sun rays, symbolizing radiance and aiming to make the athletes "shine even brighter," as described by Chaumet's creative director, ClÃ©mentine Massonnat-Schaller. The reverse side of the medals will depict the Greek goddess of victory, Nike, a traditional figure that has been featured on Olympic medals since the 2004 Games in Athens.\n\nAdditionally, the ribbons for the medals will be inspired by the lattice work of the Eiffel Tower, further connecting the medals to the iconic Parisian landmark. This thoughtful design aims to celebrate both the history of the Olympic Games and the cultural significance of Paris as the host city. \n\nOverall, the Paris 2024 medals are designed not just as awards but as artifacts that embody a rich narrative of history, artistry, and modern values.
