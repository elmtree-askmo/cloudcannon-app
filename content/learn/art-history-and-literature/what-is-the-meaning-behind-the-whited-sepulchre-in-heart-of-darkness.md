    What is the meaning behind the 'Whited Sepulchre' in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," the term "whited sepulchre" serves as a powerful metaphor for the hypocrisy of European colonialism, particularly as it relates to Belgium's imperial endeavors in Africa. The phrase originates from the Biblical Book of Matthew, where it describes hypocrites who appear virtuous on the outside but are corrupt and decayed within. This imagery is particularly relevant to Brussels, the capital of Belgium, where Marlow meets the Company head before his journey into the Congo.\n\nConrad uses the "whited sepulchre" to illustrate the faÃ§ade of civility and righteousness that European powers projected while engaging in brutal exploitation and dehumanization of African peoples. The city of Brussels, while outwardly beautiful, symbolizes the grim realities of colonialism, where the rhetoric of a civilizing mission masks the greed and savagery that underpin imperialist actions. The sepulchre implies death and confinement, highlighting how Europe is the origin of colonial enterprises that bring death both to the colonizers and the colonized.\n\nFurthermore, the "whited sepulchre" motif encapsulates the broader theme of hypocrisy in "Heart of Darkness," as it critiques the moral pretensions of imperialism. The Company, representing European interests, is depicted as a prime example of this duplicity, where the supposed noble intentions of civilizing the African continent are revealed to be mere justifications for exploitation and cruelty.\n\nIn summary, the "whited sepulchre" in "Heart of Darkness" symbolizes the deceptive nature of colonialism, where the outward appearance of civilization conceals the underlying horrors and moral decay associated with imperialist practices.
