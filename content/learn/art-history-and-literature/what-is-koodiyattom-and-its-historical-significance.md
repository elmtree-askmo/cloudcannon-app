    What is Koodiyattom and its historical significance?
answer: >-
    Koodiyattam, also spelled Kutiyattam, is a traditional performing art form originating from the Indian state of Kerala. It is recognized as one of the oldest classical dance-drama forms in India, with roots that can be traced back over 2,000 years. Koodiyattam is a unique blend of ancient Sanskrit theatre and elements of Koothu, an ancient performing art from the Sangam era. \n\nHistorically, Koodiyattam has been performed in Hindu temples, particularly in temple theatres known as Koothambalam. The art form is characterized by its elaborate costumes, intricate makeup, and a unique gestural language called mudras, which actors use to convey emotions and narrate stories. The performances typically draw from ancient Sanskrit texts, including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.\n\nThe significance of Koodiyattam extends beyond its artistic value; it is a living testament to Kerala's rich cultural heritage and the enduring legacy of ancient Indian theatre. In 2008, Koodiyattam was designated by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, highlighting its global cultural importance and the need for its preservation.\n\nThe art form is closely associated with the teachings and practices of Kulasekhara Varma Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of Kerala, who is credited with shaping Koodiyattam into its present form. His work, the Aattaprakaram, is considered the most authoritative text on the art form.\n\nIn summary, Koodiyattam is not only a classical dance-drama but also a profound cultural ritual that encapsulates the spiritual and artistic traditions of ancient India, making it a vital part of Kerala's cultural identity.
