    What are K. Chellappan's views on translation, and how have they influenced his work?
answer: >-
    K. Chellappan, a distinguished professor and translator, held profound views on translation, which significantly influenced his work. He regarded translation as a fundamental act of cognition and creation, emphasizing that every act of perception involves translation and creation. This perspective highlights the intricate relationship between language, thought, and cultural expression.\n\nChellappan's scholarly contributions include his work titled "Translation as Interlingual and Intercultural Communication," where he explored the nuances of translation beyond mere linguistic conversion. He argued that translation serves as a medium for interlingual and intercultural communication, facilitating a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and ideas. His approach was informed by philosophical insights, drawing on thinkers like Derrida and Benjamin, who viewed translation as a kinship of languages rooted in the intentions underlying each language.\n\nHis notable achievements include winning the Sahitya Akademi Prize for Translation in 2020 for his Tamil translation of Rabindranath Tagore's "Gora," a classic Bengali novel. This work not only showcased his translation skills but also his ability to engage with complex themes that remain relevant in contemporary discourse.\n\nChellappan's views on translation as a form of cultural subversion and appropriation, particularly in the context of Indian translation practices, further illustrate his innovative approach. He contrasted this with the perception of translation in Canada, where it is often seen as cultural assimilation. This critical perspective on translation practices enriched his contributions to the field and influenced many students and scholars in literature and translation studies.\n\nOverall, K. Chellappan's insights into translation as a cognitive and creative act, along with his commitment to fostering intercultural communication, have left a lasting impact on the literary community and the study of translation.
