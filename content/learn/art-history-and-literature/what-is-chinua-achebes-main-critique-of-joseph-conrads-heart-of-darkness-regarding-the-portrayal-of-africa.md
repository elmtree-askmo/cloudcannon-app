    What is Chinua Achebe's main critique of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' regarding the portrayal of Africa?
answer: >-
    Chinua Achebe's main critique of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' centers on the racist portrayal of Africa and the dehumanization of its people. In his influential essay "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness," Achebe argues that Conrad's narrative reduces Africans to mere objects within a Eurocentric framework, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that depict Africa as a primitive "other" to validate European civilization.\n\nAchebe highlights several key points in his critique:\n\n1. **Dehumanization of Africans**: Achebe asserts that Conrad's narrative dehumanizes Africans, portraying them as faceless entities rather than individuals with rich histories and cultures. This reductionist view serves to reinforce colonial stereotypes and ignores the complexity of African societies.\n\n2. **Eurocentric Perspective**: Achebe emphasizes that Conrad's work is steeped in a Eurocentric perspective that fails to recognize Africa's humanity and historical significance. The narrative positions Europe as the center of civilization while depicting Africa as a dark, uncivilized place.\n\n3. **Need for Authentic African Voices**: Achebe calls for a reevaluation of literary legacies and stresses the importance of authentic African voices in literature. He argues that literature should reflect the true experiences and perspectives of African people rather than being filtered through a colonial lens.\n\n4. **Critique of Imperialism**: While some critics have interpreted 'Heart of Darkness' as a critique of colonialism, Achebe contends that it ultimately fails to do justice to Africa and its people. The novella reveals the moral decay of European imperialism but does so at the expense of accurately representing African lives and cultures.\n\nIn summary, Achebe's critique of 'Heart of Darkness' is a powerful condemnation of the racist undertones present in Conrad's work, calling for a more nuanced and respectful representation of Africa and its peoples in literature.
