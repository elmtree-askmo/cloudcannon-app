    What is apophasis and how does it work in rhetoric?
answer: >-
    Apophasis is a rhetorical device that involves mentioning a subject while simultaneously claiming not to mention it. This technique allows the speaker or writer to bring attention to a topic indirectly, often by denying the intention to discuss it. The term originates from the Ancient Greek word ἀπόφασις (apóphasis), which means "to say no."\n\nIn practice, apophasis can serve various functions in rhetoric. It can leave the substance of a sensitive subject to the imagination of the audience, thereby enhancing its impact. For example, a speaker might say, "I won't even mention the questionable ethics of my opponent's past," which effectively highlights the opponent's flaws while maintaining a facade of neutrality.\n\nApophasis is often compared to other rhetorical devices such as paralepsis and praeteritio, which also involve mentioning something by claiming to omit it. This technique can be particularly effective in persuasive communication, as it captures attention and shapes perceptions without overtly addressing the subject.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of apophasis in action is found in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," where Marc Antony uses it to sway public opinion against Brutus and the other conspirators. By employing this device, Antony draws attention to the conspirators' actions while ostensibly distancing himself from direct criticism.\n\nOverall, apophasis is a versatile and powerful tool in rhetoric that can elevate persuasive communication by allowing speakers to address sensitive topics in a nuanced manner.
