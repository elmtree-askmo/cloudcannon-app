    What are the different levels of narratives?
answer: >-
    The different levels of narratives can be categorized into five distinct types, each serving a unique purpose and structure. Here are the levels:\n\n1. **Narrative Story**: This is the most basic level, where a story is told with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It typically involves characters, a plot, and a setting.\n\n2. **Narrative Essay (Personal Narrative Essay)**: This level involves a personal account or reflection, where the author shares their experiences and insights, often using a first-person perspective.\n\n3. **Narrative Non-Fiction**: This type combines factual information with narrative techniques, telling true stories in a compelling way. It often includes elements of storytelling while remaining grounded in reality.\n\n4. **Expository Text that Is Narration**: This level includes texts that explain or inform while incorporating narrative elements. It may present information in a narrative format to enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Narrative as a Tool in Other Types of Writing**: At this level, narrative techniques are employed within various genres, such as poetry, academic writing, or journalism, to convey messages more effectively.\n\nIt's important to note that while the bottom two levels utilize narrative or narration, their primary genre is not strictly narrative. Understanding these levels can help in analyzing how narratives function across different contexts and mediums.
