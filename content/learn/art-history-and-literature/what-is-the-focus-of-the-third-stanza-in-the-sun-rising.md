    What is the focus of the third stanza in 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    The focus of the third stanza in John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising" centers on the speaker's assertion that his lover embodies all the nations of the world, while he represents all the princes of those nations. In this stanza, the speaker emphasizes the idea that their love is so profound that it transcends the significance of worldly power and wealth. He declares that nothing else matters outside of their intimate connection, suggesting that the rulers of the world merely mimic the true love that he and his lover share.\n\nThe speaker further critiques the value of material wealth, referring to it as "alchemy," which implies that attempts to transform lesser metals into gold are futile compared to the richness of their love. This stanza encapsulates the poem's overarching theme of love's transcendence over societal norms and the natural order, positioning the lovers as the true center of the universe, with the sun invited to revolve around them rather than the other way around. \n\nOverall, the third stanza serves to reinforce the poem's exploration of love's cosmic significance and the mockery of celestial authority, as the speaker elevates their personal experience above the grandiosity of kings and nations.
