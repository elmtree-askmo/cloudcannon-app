    How does the rising action develop the central conflicts in the novel?
answer: >-
    In Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," the rising action significantly develops the central conflicts through the protagonist Jude Fawley's relationships and aspirations. The initial conflict arises when Jude meets Arabella Donn, which marks the beginning of a series of complications in his life. Initially, Jude is captivated by Arabella, leading him to neglect his dreams of education and scholarly pursuits. This relationship serves as a catalyst for the unfolding drama, as Jude's romantic entanglement with Arabella ultimately leads to his first marriage, which is fraught with misunderstandings and societal pressures.\n\nAs the rising action progresses, the theme of marriage and sexual morality becomes increasingly central to the narrative. Hardy's notes indicate that while the novel began with Jude's educational aspirations, the complexities of marriage and societal expectations took precedence. This shift highlights the tragic machinery of the story, where Jude's desires are constantly thwarted by the rigid social structures of Victorian society. The conflict between personal aspirations and societal norms is a recurring theme, as Jude struggles to reconcile his ambitions with the expectations placed upon him.\n\nMoreover, the rising action introduces Jude's relationship with Sue Bridehead, which further complicates his life. Their bond is characterized by intellectual compatibility and emotional depth, yet it is also marred by societal constraints and the fear of conventional marriage. This relationship amplifies Jude's internal conflicts, as he grapples with his desires for love and acceptance against the backdrop of societal judgment and moral hypocrisy.\n\nOverall, the rising action in "Jude the Obscure" intricately weaves together themes of class limitations, marriage, and the futility of aspirations, ultimately leading to a tragic exploration of the human condition. The conflicts that arise from Jude's relationships and societal expectations serve to deepen the narrative, illustrating Hardy's critique of the social structures that govern individual lives.
