answer: >-
    Notable architectural manifestos have played a significant role in shaping the discourse and direction of architecture throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Here are some of the most influential manifestos and their impacts on the field:\n\n1. **De Stijl Manifesto I (1918)**: Authored by members of the De Stijl movement, this manifesto emphasized abstraction and simplicity in design, advocating for a universal aesthetic that transcended individual styles. It laid the groundwork for modernist architecture and influenced various art forms, promoting the idea that architecture should reflect the underlying order of the universe.\n\n2. **Bauhaus Manifesto (1919)**: Written by Walter Gropius, this manifesto established the principles of the Bauhaus school, which sought to unify art, craft, and technology. It emphasized functional design and the importance of collaboration between different disciplines. The Bauhaus movement became a cornerstone of modern architecture and design education, influencing countless architects and designers worldwide.\n\n3. **5 Points of Architecture (1926)**: Le Corbusier's manifesto outlined five key principles for modern architecture: pilotis (supports), flat roofs, open floor plans, horizontal windows, and free facades. This manifesto not only defined his architectural style but also had a lasting impact on modernist architecture, promoting a new way of thinking about space and form.\n\n4. **Ornament and Crime (1910)**: In this influential essay, Austrian architect Adolf Loos argued against the use of ornamentation in architecture, positing that it was a sign of cultural and moral decay. His ideas challenged traditional notions of beauty and decoration, advocating for a minimalist approach that has continued to resonate in contemporary design discussions.\n\n5. **Manifesto of Futurist Architecture (1914)**: Authored by Antonio Sant'Elia, this manifesto expressed the Futurist movement's desire to break away from historical architectural styles and embrace modernity and technology. It called for dynamic forms and structures that reflected the energy of the modern age, influencing the development of avant-garde architecture.\n\nThese manifestos not only articulated new architectural philosophies but also stimulated dialogues about the role of architecture in society, the relationship between form and function, and the integration of ecological considerations in design. They have inspired generations of architects to explore innovative ideas and challenge established norms, ultimately shaping the built environment we experience today.
