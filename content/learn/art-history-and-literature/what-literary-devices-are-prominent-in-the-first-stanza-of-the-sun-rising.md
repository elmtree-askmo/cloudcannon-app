    What literary devices are prominent in the first stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the first stanza of John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," several prominent literary devices are employed to convey the speaker's irritation with the sun and to establish the poem's themes of love and time. Here are some key literary devices used in this stanza:\n\n1. **Personification**: The sun is personified as a "busy old fool" and a "saucy pedantic wretch." This personification not only gives the sun human-like qualities but also portrays it as an intrusive and annoying presence that disrupts the intimacy of the lovers.\n\n2. **Hyperbole**: The speaker exaggerates the sun's role in the lives of people, suggesting that it is overly authoritative and meddlesome. This hyperbolic language emphasizes the speaker's disdain for the sun's intrusion into their private moment.\n\n3. **Imagery**: The imagery in the stanza vividly depicts the setting of the poem, where the sun's rays are described as peeping through the windows, symbolizing the unwelcome arrival of daybreak that interrupts the lovers' time together.\n\n4. **Apostrophe**: The speaker directly addresses the sun, which is a form of apostrophe. This device creates a conversational tone and emphasizes the speaker's frustration, as he speaks to the sun as if it can hear and respond to him.\n\n5. **Rhyme Scheme**: The stanza follows an ABBA rhyme scheme, which contributes to the musical quality of the poem. This structured form contrasts with the chaotic emotions expressed by the speaker, enhancing the tension between love and the external world.\n\nThese literary devices work together to establish the poem's playful yet defiant tone, highlighting the speaker's belief in the supremacy of love over the constraints imposed by time and nature.
