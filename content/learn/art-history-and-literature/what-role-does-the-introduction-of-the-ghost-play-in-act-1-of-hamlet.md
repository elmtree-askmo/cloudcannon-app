    What role does the introduction of the Ghost play in Act 1 of 'Hamlet'?
answer: >-
    The introduction of the Ghost in Act 1 of 'Hamlet' plays a pivotal role in establishing the central conflict and themes of the play. Firstly, the Ghost serves as a catalyst for the action, revealing to Hamlet that his father, King Hamlet, was murdered by his brother Claudius. This revelation not only sets the plot in motion but also introduces the themes of revenge and moral ambiguity, as Hamlet grapples with the implications of avenging his father's death.\n\nMoreover, the Ghost creates an atmosphere of suspense and foreboding, drawing the audience into the psychological and emotional turmoil that Hamlet will face throughout the play. The Ghost's demand for revenge emphasizes the weight of familial duty and the complexities of loyalty, as Hamlet is torn between his desire for vengeance and the moral implications of such an act. This encounter ultimately shapes Hamlet's character and propels him into a state of existential conflict, making the Ghost a crucial element in the unfolding tragedy.
