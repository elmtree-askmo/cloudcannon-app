    How does Donne use personification in the first stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the first stanza of John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," the poet employs personification to depict the sun as an intrusive and busy figure. The speaker directly addresses the sun, referring to it as a "busy old fool," which imbues the celestial body with human-like qualities, suggesting that it is meddlesome and overly concerned with the affairs of the lovers. This personification serves to elevate the speaker's love above the sun's authority, as he argues that the sun's presence is unnecessary and even disruptive to their intimate moment.\n\nThe speaker asserts that the sun's role is to warm the world, yet he dismisses its importance in the context of their love, implying that their relationship transcends the sun's influence. By characterizing the sun in this way, Donne not only highlights the theme of love's supremacy over external forces but also employs humor and wit, as the speaker mocks the sun's perceived authority. This clever use of personification sets the tone for the poem, establishing a playful yet profound exploration of love's cosmic significance.
