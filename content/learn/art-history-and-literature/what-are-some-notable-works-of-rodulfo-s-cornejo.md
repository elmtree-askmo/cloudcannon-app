    What are some notable works of Rodulfo S. Cornejo?
answer: >-
    Rodolfo S. Cornejo was a prominent Filipino composer, pianist, and conductor, born on May 15, 1909, in Manila. He is recognized for his significant contributions to contemporary music in the Philippines and is noted as the first Filipino composer to receive an honorary degree from a government-recognized music school in the United States.\n\nSome of his notable works include:\n\n1. **Pakiusap**\n2. **Madaling Araw**\n3. **Sakali Man**\n4. **Hibik ng Pilipinas**\n5. **Ano Kaya ang Kapalaran**\n6. **Kundiman (Anak Dalita)**\n7. **Kandingan for 2 Pianos - Moro Wedding Dance (1974)**\n8. **Philippine Suite: Okaka Variations (1941)**\n\nCornejo's early musical education began at the age of six, and by the age of 13, he had already composed a military march titled **Salute**. His talent was evident as he had twenty-six works listed by the United Publishing Co. by the time he was 16. His improvisational skills were also remarkable, allowing him to create piano compositions spontaneously.\n\nThroughout his career, Cornejo's music has been celebrated not only in the Philippines but also internationally, solidifying his legacy as one of the notable contemporary composers in Philippine music.
