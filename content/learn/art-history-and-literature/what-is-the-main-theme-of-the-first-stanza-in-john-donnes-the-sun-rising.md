    What is the main theme of the first stanza in John Donne's 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    The main theme of the first stanza in John Donne's "The Sun Rising" revolves around the speaker's playful defiance against the sun, which he perceives as an unwelcome intruder. The stanza opens with the speaker addressing the sun as a "busy old fool" and "unruly," indicating his frustration with the sun's intrusion into his intimate moment with his lover. This establishes a tone of mockery and exasperation, as the speaker challenges the sun's authority and significance in the face of his all-consuming love.\n\nIn this stanza, the speaker emphasizes the power of love over the natural order, suggesting that their love is more important than the sun's daily cycle. The imagery of the sun's "celestial motions" is juxtaposed with the intimate setting of the bedroom, highlighting the conflict between the demands of the outside world and the personal realm of love. This theme of love's precedence over worldly concerns is central to the poem, as the speaker ultimately asserts that their love transcends the limitations imposed by time and nature.
