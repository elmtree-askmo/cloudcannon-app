answer: >-
    Nicanor Santa Ana Abelardo (February 7, 1893 - March 21, 1934) was a prominent Filipino composer, pianist, and teacher, widely regarded as the "Father of the Sonata in the Philippines." Born in San Miguel de Mayumo (now San Miguel, Bulacan), he was the eldest of eight children in a family with artistic inclinations; his father was a photographer and his mother a church singer.\n\nAbelardo's musical journey began at a young age when he was introduced to music by his father, who taught him solfeggio and the banduria. He pursued formal music education at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music in 1916 and later studied at the Chicago Musical College, where he was influenced by the musical styles of the Serialist/Second Viennese School and Post-Romantic European composers.\n\nThroughout his career, Abelardo composed over 140 works, including sonatas, concerti, chamber music, and numerous kundiman songs, which are traditional Filipino love songs. He is particularly celebrated for elevating the kundiman to the level of art, transforming it into a western art-song form. Some of his most famous compositions include "Mutya ng Pasig," "Bituing Marikit," "Nasaan Ka Irog," and the official song of the University of the Philippines, "U.P. Beloved."\n\nAbelardo's contributions to Philippine music were significant, as he played a crucial role in creating a national musical identity in the post-colonial era. His works often reflected modernism while maintaining a strong connection to Filipino cultural themes. He passed away in 1934, leaving behind a rich legacy that continues to influence Filipino musicians and composers today. His life and contributions are documented in the biography "Nicanor Abelardo: The Man and the Artist" by Ernesto V. Epistola.
