    How was William Blake's work recognized during and after his lifetime?
answer: >-
    William Blake's recognition during and after his lifetime reflects a significant transformation in the perception of his work. During his lifetime (1757-1827), Blake was largely unrecognized and often misunderstood. His unconventional artistic style and subject matter, which emphasized imagination and spirituality, did not resonate with the mainstream audiences or critics of his time. As a result, his works, including his poetry and engravings, did not achieve commercial success, and he struggled financially throughout his life.\n\nHowever, the posthumous recognition of Blake's contributions began to grow significantly after his death. A pivotal moment in this shift occurred with the publication of Alexander Gilchrist's biography, *The Life of William Blake*, in 1863. This biography played a crucial role in reviving interest in Blake's work and establishing his legacy as a major figure in both literature and art. It helped to rescue him from obscurity and highlighted his visionary qualities, which were increasingly appreciated in the context of the Romantic movement.\n\nIn the years following Gilchrist's biography, Blake's influence became more pronounced. He inspired various artistic movements, including the Pre-Raphaelites and Surrealists, and his themes of individuality and rebellion against conventional authority resonated with later generations of writers and artists. His work is now celebrated for its innovative use of symbolism, imagery, and personification, as well as its profound social critique, particularly regarding issues like child labor and poverty.\n\nBlake's legacy continued to grow, culminating in the establishment of a memorial in Westminster Abbey in 1957, further solidifying his status as one of Britain's finest artists. Today, he is regarded as a seminal figure in British cultural history, whose visionary art and poetry have left an indelible mark on the artistic tradition and continue to inspire contemporary artists and writers.
