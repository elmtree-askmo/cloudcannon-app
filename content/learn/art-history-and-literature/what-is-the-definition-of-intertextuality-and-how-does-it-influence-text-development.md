    What is the definition of intertextuality and how does it influence text development?
answer: >-
    Intertextuality is a concept that refers to the relationship between texts and the network of prior texts and discourses that influence their creation and interpretation. It challenges the idea of a single, stable text by emphasizing that all texts are interconnected and derive meaning from their relationships with other texts. This interdependence can manifest in various forms, such as references, adaptations, parodies, and allusions, which enrich the reading experience and deepen the understanding of a text.\n\nIntertextuality influences text development in several ways:\n\n1. **Meaning Creation**: Texts do not exist in isolation; they are part of a larger cultural and literary context. The meanings of a new text are shaped by its connections to previous works, allowing for a richer interpretation. For example, a novel may reference a classic work, thereby inviting readers to draw parallels and contrasts that enhance their understanding of both texts.\n\n2. **Cultural Commentary**: Through intertextuality, authors can comment on or critique existing texts and cultural narratives. This can involve reinterpreting themes, characters, or plots from earlier works, which can lead to new insights and discussions about societal issues.\n\n3. **Reader Engagement**: Intertextual references can engage readers by prompting them to recall and reflect on other texts they have encountered. This engagement can create a more interactive reading experience, as readers may find themselves making connections and drawing on their own knowledge of literature and culture.\n\n4. **Textual Evolution**: Intertextuality highlights the dynamic nature of texts, suggesting that they are constantly evolving through the influence of other works. This can lead to the adaptation and appropriation of ideas across different media, contributing to the ongoing development of literary and artistic forms.\n\nIn summary, intertextuality is a fundamental aspect of text development, as it underscores the interconnectedness of literature and culture, enriches meaning, and fosters a deeper engagement with texts.
