    Notable novels from the Victorian era that depict colonialism include:\n\n1. **"She" (1887) by H. Rider Haggard** - This novel explores themes of adventure and imperialism through the story of a British expedition to Africa, where they encounter a powerful female ruler.\n\n2. **"Kim" (1901) by Rudyard Kipling** - Set in British-occupied India, this novel follows the journey of a young boy who becomes embroiled in the political intrigues of the British Empire and the native cultures.\n\n3. **"Heart of Darkness" (1899) by Joseph Conrad** - This novella critiques imperialism through the journey of Charles Marlow into the Congo River basin, exploring the darkness of colonial exploitation.\n\n4. **"The Man Who Would Be King" (1888) by Rudyard Kipling** - This story follows two British adventurers who become kings of a remote part of Afghanistan, highlighting the absurdities and moral complexities of colonial rule.\n\nThese works reflect the broader themes of power, control, and cultural interactions that characterized Victorian literature, as well as the impact of colonialism on both the colonizers and the colonized. The Victorian era, marked by significant political and social changes, saw literature that both supported and critiqued the imperialist agenda, providing a rich field for exploration in colonial studies.
