    In 'Things Fall Apart', how does Okonkwo symbolize the theme of tradition versus modernity?
answer: >-
    In Chinua Achebe's 'Things Fall Apart', the character of Okonkwo serves as a powerful symbol of the theme of tradition versus modernity. Okonkwo embodies the traditional Igbo values and cultural practices that define his society, representing strength, masculinity, and adherence to customs. His life is deeply intertwined with the cultural fabric of Umuofia, where he is a respected warrior and a successful yam farmer, both of which are central to Igbo identity and social status.\n\nHowever, Okonkwo's rigid adherence to tradition ultimately leads to his downfall. His fear of being perceived as weak, stemming from his father's failures, drives him to uphold a hyper-masculine persona that values aggression and dominance. This inflexible view of masculinity not only alienates him from his son Nwoye, who seeks a more nurturing and compassionate identity, but also blinds him to the changes occurring within his society due to colonial influences. Nwoye's conversion to Christianity symbolizes a rejection of Okonkwo's traditional values and highlights the generational conflict between the old ways and the new ideologies introduced by European missionaries.\n\nThe arrival of colonial forces disrupts the social cohesion of Umuofia, leading to a crisis of identity for its members. Okonkwo's inability to adapt to these changes reflects the broader struggle faced by individuals and communities caught between the pull of tradition and the push of modernity. His tragic end, culminating in suicide, serves as a poignant commentary on the destructive impact of colonialism on both personal and cultural levels.\n\nAchebe's use of a third-person narrator allows for a more objective exploration of these themes, illustrating the complexities of Igbo culture and the profound effects of colonialism. The title of the novel itself, derived from W.B. Yeats' poem, underscores the disintegration of traditional values and the chaos that ensues when the center cannot hold. Through Okonkwo's story, Achebe critiques the forces of cultural imperialism and the loss of identity that accompanies the clash between tradition and modernity.
