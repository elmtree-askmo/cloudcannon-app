    How does Arabella Donn's character contrast with Sue Bridehead's?
answer: >-
    In Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," the characters of Arabella Donn and Sue Bridehead serve as contrasting representations of femininity and societal roles, highlighting the complexities of women's experiences in the Victorian era.\n\nArabella Donn is depicted as a coarse and manipulative woman, the daughter of a pig farmer. She is characterized by her frankness about her sexuality and her cunning nature. Arabella's primary motivation is to secure a man who can provide her with comfort and material luxuries. She is described as attractive in an overblown way, good-humored, and practical, yet she lacks education and exhibits selfishness and thoughtlessness. Her relationship with Jude Fawley is marked by deception; she tricks him into marrying her by pretending to be pregnant, which ultimately leads to a disastrous marriage.\n\nIn stark contrast, Sue Bridehead is portrayed as a complex and intelligent character who defies societal norms. Raised in a more progressive environment, Sue embodies a blend of beauty and intellect, described as having a "pretty girlish face" while also being independent and questioning traditional values. She rejects Christianity and explores paganism, showcasing her desire for autonomy and her struggle against societal expectations. Sue's relationship with Jude is characterized by emotional depth and intellectual engagement, as she challenges him to think critically about their lives and the world around them.\n\nThe differences between Arabella and Sue extend beyond their personalities to their treatment of Jude. Arabella's approach is pragmatic and manipulative, while Sue's is more philosophical and emotionally complex. This contrast not only highlights the varying roles women play in the narrative but also reflects Hardy's critique of the limitations placed on women in society. Ultimately, Arabella represents a more traditional, survival-oriented femininity, while Sue embodies a modern, questioning spirit that seeks to redefine women's roles in a changing world.
