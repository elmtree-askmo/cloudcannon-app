    How did Romantic poetry influence John Keats's work?
answer: >-
    Romantic poetry had a profound influence on John Keats's work, shaping his themes, style, and overall poetic vision. As a key figure in the Romantic movement, Keats embodied its ideals through his exploration of emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature. His poetry is characterized by vivid imagery and sensuous language, which are hallmarks of Romanticism.\n\nOne of the major themes in Keats's poetry is the contemplation of beauty, which aligns with the Romantic emphasis on aesthetic experience. In works like "Ode to a Nightingale," Keats reflects on the fleeting nature of life and the desire for transcendence through art. This poem, in particular, illustrates the Romantic ideal of seeking escape from the harsh realities of existence, as the speaker grapples with the tension between the immortal beauty of the nightingale's song and the inevitability of death.\n\nAdditionally, Keats's focus on nature is a significant aspect of his work, mirroring the Romantic belief in the healing and transformative power of the natural world. His odes often depict nature as a source of inspiration and solace, allowing for a deep emotional connection between the individual and the environment.\n\nKeats's poetry also showcases the Romantic preoccupation with the inner experience of the individual. His use of personal voice and subjective perspective invites readers to engage with the emotional depth of his work. This is evident in his exploration of themes such as love, mortality, and the tension between idealism and reality.\n\nIn summary, Romantic poetry influenced John Keats's work by providing a framework for his exploration of beauty, nature, and the complexities of human emotion. His contributions to the Romantic movement not only reflect these ideals but also helped to shape the trajectory of poetry in the 19th century, making him an iconic figure in literary history.
