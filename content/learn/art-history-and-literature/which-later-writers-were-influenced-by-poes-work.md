answer: >-
    Edgar Allan Poe's work has had a profound influence on a wide range of later writers across various genres. Notably, he is often credited as a pioneer of the modern detective story, which significantly impacted authors like Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the iconic character Sherlock Holmes. Poe's mastery of the macabre and his exploration of psychological themes also inspired writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, who is known for his contributions to the horror genre.\n\nAdditionally, French poet Charles Baudelaire was heavily influenced by Poe, translating his works and helping to introduce them to a European audience. Ambrose Bierce, known for his dark and satirical writing, also drew inspiration from Poe's themes and style. In the realm of contemporary literature, Stephen King has acknowledged Poe's influence on his own writing, particularly in the horror genre.\n\nPoe's legacy extends beyond literature; his work has inspired filmmakers, musicians, and artists, leading to a lasting impact on popular culture. His exploration of themes such as death, madness, and the supernatural continues to resonate with writers and creators today, making him a pivotal figure in the literary canon.
