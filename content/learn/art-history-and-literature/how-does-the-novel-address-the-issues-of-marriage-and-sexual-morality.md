    How does the novel address the issues of marriage and sexual morality?
answer: >-
    In "Jude the Obscure," Thomas Hardy addresses the issues of marriage and sexual morality through a critical lens, reflecting the societal norms and expectations of Victorian England. The novel portrays marriage as a restrictive and often damaging institution, highlighting the personal conflicts and societal pressures that arise from traditional views on marriage.\n\nHardy's narrative illustrates the tragic consequences of marriage through the experiences of the main characters, Jude, Sue, and Arabella. Jude is guilted into marrying Arabella due to her feigned pregnancy, a decision he quickly regrets. Similarly, Sue marries Phillotson primarily to provoke jealousy in Jude, which also leads to her unhappiness. These examples underscore Hardy's skepticism about the institution of marriage, suggesting that it often results in emotional turmoil rather than fulfillment.\n\nThe author critiques the societal expectations surrounding marriage, emphasizing how these norms can lead to tragic outcomes. Hardy's exploration of sexual morality is intertwined with his examination of marriage, as he questions the validity of societal standards that dictate personal relationships. The characters' struggles with love, desire, and societal constraints reveal the complexities of human relationships and the often-painful realities of pursuing happiness within the confines of marriage.\n\nOverall, "Jude the Obscure" serves as a poignant commentary on the flaws of the marriage institution and the moral dilemmas associated with sexual relationships, ultimately portraying a world where aspirations for love and happiness are frequently thwarted by societal expectations.
