    In what ways does the priest's characterization contrast with that of St. Francis?
answer: >-
    The characterization of the priest in Norman MacCaig's poem "Assisi" starkly contrasts with that of St. Francis, highlighting themes of social injustice and the hypocrisy of the Church. \n\n1. **St. Francis's Characterization**: St. Francis is depicted as a figure of humility and compassion. Phrases such as "brother of the poor" and "talker with birds" emphasize his kinship with the marginalized and his deep connection to nature. The use of simple language in these descriptions conveys his moral values of humility and generosity, suggesting that he would have actively helped those in need, such as the beggar mentioned in the poem. The term "honour" associated with St. Francis carries connotations of respect and reverence, which can also be interpreted ironically to critique the Church's failure to embody his teachings.\n\n2. **The Priest's Characterization**: In contrast, the priest is portrayed with a sarcastic tone, particularly in the line "explained how clever it was of Giotto to make his frescoes tell." This highlights his patronizing demeanor and suggests a sense of superiority over the tourists, as he manipulates their understanding of art for his own intellectual validation. The reference to Giotto serves to elevate the priest's self-importance, while the phrase "tell stories" is simplistic and childlike, further emphasizing his condescension and detachment from the spiritual essence that St. Francis embodied.\n\n3. **Language and Imagery**: The poet's use of language effectively conveys this contrast. For instance, the priest's dialogue is laden with sarcasm and a sense of trickery, which starkly opposes the genuine humility and kindness associated with St. Francis. The imagery surrounding St. Francis evokes warmth and compassion, while the priest's characterization is cold and self-serving.\n\nIn summary, the contrast between St. Francis and the priest serves to critique the Church's hypocrisy and the neglect of its foundational values of compassion and equality. St. Francis represents a life dedicated to serving others and embracing all of creation, while the priest embodies a more superficial and self-important approach to faith and spirituality. This juxtaposition invites readers to reflect on the true essence of religious teachings and the societal implications of their neglect.
