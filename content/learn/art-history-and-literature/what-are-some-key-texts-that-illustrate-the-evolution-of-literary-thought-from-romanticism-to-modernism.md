    What are some key texts that illustrate the evolution of literary thought from Romanticism to Modernism?
answer: >-
    The evolution of literary thought from Romanticism to Modernism is marked by significant shifts in themes, styles, and philosophical underpinnings. Here are some key texts that illustrate this progression:\n\n1. **Romanticism**:\n   - **"Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley**: This novel is a quintessential example of Romantic literature, emphasizing the themes of individualism, the sublime, and the conflict between humanity and nature. It reflects the Romantic ideal of exploring deep emotional experiences and the consequences of unchecked ambition.\n   - **"Cyrano de Bergerac" by Edmond Rostand**: This play showcases the Romantic emphasis on heroism, love, and the complexities of human emotion, highlighting the importance of imagination and personal expression.\n\n2. **Transcendentalism** (often considered a branch of Romanticism):\n   - **"Nature" by Ralph Waldo Emerson**: Emerson's essay articulates the transcendental belief in the inherent goodness of nature and the individualâ€™s connection to it, emphasizing self-reliance and personal intuition.\n   - **"Walden" by Henry David Thoreau**: This work reflects Thoreau's experiment in simple living and his philosophical exploration of nature, individualism, and society, embodying the transcendentalist ideals of self-discovery and connection to the natural world.\n\n3. **Modernism**:\n   - **"The Waste Land" by T.S. Eliot**: This poem is a landmark of Modernist literature, characterized by its fragmented structure, allusions to various texts and cultures, and exploration of disillusionment in the post-World War I era. It reflects the alienation and fragmentation that define Modernist thought.\n   - **"To the Lighthouse" by Virginia Woolf**: This novel exemplifies Modernist techniques such as stream of consciousness and nonlinear narrative, focusing on the inner thoughts and perceptions of characters, thus highlighting themes of time, memory, and the subjective nature of reality.\n\nThese texts not only represent their respective movements but also illustrate the broader cultural and philosophical shifts in literature, from the emotional and imaginative focus of Romanticism to the introspective and often fragmented nature of Modernism. Each movement brought innovative approaches that enriched the literary landscape and influenced future generations of writers.
