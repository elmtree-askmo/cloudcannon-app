answer: >-
    Francisco Santiago (January 29, 1889 - September 28, 1947) was a prominent Filipino musician, composer, and conductor, often referred to as the "Father of Kundiman Art Song." He was born in Santa Maria, Bulacan, Philippines, to musically inclined peasant parents, Felipe and Maria Santiago. His early exposure to music laid the foundation for his future contributions to Filipino music.\n\nSantiago's musical career began to flourish in 1908 when he composed his first piece, "Purita," which was dedicated to the first Carnival Queen, Pura Villanueva. He later pursued formal music education at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, where he earned his Doctorate in 1924. His education allowed him to integrate Western musical elements with traditional Filipino themes, significantly shaping the musical landscape of the Philippines during the early 20th century.\n\nHe is best known for his contributions to the kundiman genre, a traditional Filipino love song characterized by its lyrical and melodic qualities. Some of his most celebrated works include "Anak Dalita" and "Pakiusap," which remain staples in the repertoire of Filipino singers today. Santiago also composed "Sumilang na Ang Manunubos," recognized as the first Philippine Christmas carol written for mixed chorus and symphony orchestra, and the sarswela "Si Margaritang Mananahi" in 1913, with a libretto by Severino Reyes.\n\nThroughout his life, Santiago was not only a composer but also a teacher and film director, influencing many aspiring musicians. He married Concepcion Z. Ocampo in 1923, and they had four children. His legacy continues to be celebrated in the Philippines, with institutions and venues honoring his contributions to music. Santiago passed away from a heart attack in 1947, leaving behind a rich legacy that has profoundly impacted Filipino music and culture.
