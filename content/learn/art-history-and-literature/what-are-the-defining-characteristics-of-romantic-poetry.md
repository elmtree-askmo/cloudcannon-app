    What are the defining characteristics of Romantic poetry?
answer: >-
    Romantic poetry, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, is characterized by several defining features that distinguish it from previous literary movements. Here are the key characteristics of Romantic poetry:\n\n1. **Emphasis on Emotion and Imagination**: Romantic poets prioritized emotional intensity and personal feelings over rational thought and societal norms. They believed that emotions were the primary source of artistic inspiration, leading to a deep exploration of the human experience.\n\n2. **Celebration of Nature**: Nature plays a central role in Romantic poetry, often depicted as a source of beauty, solace, and divine presence. Poets like William Wordsworth and John Keats used nature to explore themes of the sublime and the transformative power of the natural world.\n\n3. **Individualism and Personal Experience**: Romantic poetry often focuses on the individual and their unique perspective. This includes a celebration of the common man and an exploration of personal identity, spirituality, and the inner self.\n\n4. **Escapism**: Many Romantic poets sought refuge in their work, using poetry as a means to escape the hardships of life. This escapism often manifested in themes of idealism, nostalgia, and a longing for a simpler, more innocent time.\n\n5. **Interest in the Supernatural and the Exotic**: Romantic poetry frequently incorporates elements of the supernatural, the mysterious, and the exotic. This fascination with the unknown reflects a desire to transcend the ordinary and explore deeper truths.\n\n6. **Use of Symbolism and Imagery**: Romantic poets employed powerful language, vivid imagery, and symbolism to evoke emotions and convey complex ideas. This use of literary devices enhances the emotional depth and aesthetic beauty of their work.\n\n7. **Melancholy and Isolation**: A sense of melancholy and isolation is prevalent in Romantic poetry, often reflecting the poets' struggles with personal loss, societal constraints, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world.\n\n8. **Rebellion Against Tradition**: Romanticism can be seen as a reaction against the strict rules of classical and neoclassical literature. Romantic poets embraced spontaneity, creativity, and the freedom to express their unique voices.\n\n9. **Exploration of Love and Passion**: Love, in its various forms, is a recurring theme in Romantic poetry. Poets often idealized love and passion, using them as sources of inspiration and as reflections of the human condition.\n\nThese characteristics collectively define Romantic poetry as a movement that values emotion, individual experience, and a deep connection to nature, while also challenging traditional literary forms and conventions.
