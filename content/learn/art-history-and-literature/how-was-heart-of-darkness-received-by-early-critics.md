    How was 'Heart of Darkness' received by early critics?
answer: >-
    "Heart of Darkness," published in 1899, received a mixed reception from early critics upon its release. Many contemporaries found the novella to be shocking and controversial, primarily due to its critical portrayal of colonialism and the moral ambiguities it presented. Critics noted Conrad's innovative narrative style and the depth of his themes, which explored the darkness of human nature and the impacts of imperialism.\n\nSome early reviews praised Conrad for being one of the first writers to depict the negative aspects of colonialism, highlighting the exploitation and brutality faced by African people. However, others criticized the novella for its complex structure and dense symbolism, which some found difficult to navigate. The narrative's ambiguity and the portrayal of African characters also sparked debate, with some critics arguing that Conrad's perspective was limited and reflected the colonial mindset of his time.\n\nOverall, while "Heart of Darkness" was recognized for its literary merit, it also faced scrutiny for its themes and representation, setting the stage for later critiques, such as Chinua Achebe's famous condemnation of Conrad as a racist in 1977. This ongoing dialogue about the novella's implications and its critique of colonialism has continued to evolve, influencing its interpretation in literary studies.
