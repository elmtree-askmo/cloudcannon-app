    What are some of the major works in Thomas Hardy's literary career, and how did his focus shift from novels to poetry?
answer: >-
    Thomas Hardy's literary career is marked by a significant evolution in his focus, transitioning from novels to poetry over the course of his life. \n\n### Major Works in Hardy's Literary Career\n\n1. **Novels**:\n   - **Desperate Remedies** (1871): Hardy's first published novel, which set the stage for his exploration of complex human emotions and societal constraints.\n   - **Under the Greenwood Tree** (1872): A pastoral novel that reflects Hardy's deep connection to rural life.\n   - **Tess of the d'Urbervilles** (1891): A powerful critique of Victorian morality and social injustice, focusing on the tragic life of Tess.\n   - **Jude the Obscure** (1895): Hardy's last novel, which is particularly notable for its harsh critique of societal institutions, especially marriage and education.\n\n2. **Poetry**:\n   - After the publication of "Jude the Obscure," Hardy increasingly turned to poetry, believing it to be his true calling. His poetry often reflects themes of loss, nature, and existential contemplation. Notable collections include:\n     - **Wessex Poems** (1898)\n     - **Moments of Vision** (1917)\n     - **The Complete Poems** (published posthumously in 1920)\n\n### Shift from Novels to Poetry\n\nHardy's shift from novels to poetry can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- **Personal Belief**: Hardy believed that poetry allowed for a more profound expression of his thoughts and feelings. He felt constrained by the novel form, which often required adherence to societal norms and expectations.\n- **Critical Reception**: The critical reception of "Jude the Obscure" was mixed, with some reviewers harshly criticizing its themes and portrayal of society. This backlash may have influenced Hardy's decision to focus more on poetry, where he felt he could explore his ideas more freely.\n- **Life Experiences**: As Hardy aged, his reflections on life, love, and loss deepened, leading him to express these themes more succinctly and poignantly through poetry.\n\nIn summary, Thomas Hardy's literary career is characterized by a rich array of novels that critique societal norms, culminating in "Jude the Obscure," after which he shifted his focus to poetry, believing it to be a more authentic medium for his artistic expression.
