answer: >-
    RUAE (Reading for Understanding, Analysis, and Evaluation) skills are crucial for effectively identifying key themes and analyzing language use in poetry, such as in the poem "Assisi" by Norman MacCaig. Hereâ€™s how these skills can be applied:\n\n### Understanding Content\nThe first step in applying RUAE skills is to comprehend the poem's content. This involves reading the poem carefully to grasp its overall message and themes. In "Assisi," themes such as social injustice, materialism, isolation, and the hypocrisy of the Church are prevalent. Recognizing these themes allows readers to contextualize the poem and understand the poet's intentions.\n\n### Analyzing Language\nOnce the content is understood, the next step is to analyze the language used in the poem. This includes examining word choice, imagery, and figurative language. For instance, MacCaig employs harsh and dehumanizing language to describe the dwarf, which serves to highlight the societal neglect of the disabled. Phrases like "slumped like a half-filled sack" evoke a sense of pity and frustration, contrasting sharply with the more elevated language used by the priest, which underscores the disparity between their social standings.\n\n### Evaluating Effectiveness\nAfter analyzing the language, it is essential to evaluate how effectively the poet conveys themes and emotions through their choices. For example, the structure of "Assisi" is significant; it begins and ends with the dwarf, creating a full-circle effect that emphasizes the ongoing cycle of neglect and societal apathy. This structural choice enhances the poem's critique of social injustice and the Church's role in it.\n\n### Annotation Techniques\nUsing annotation techniques can further aid in the analysis. Highlighting key phrases, noting the use of poetic techniques (such as similes and metaphors), and making margin notes about the emotional impact of specific lines can deepen understanding. For example, identifying the use of simile in describing the dwarf can reveal deeper insights into the poet's perspective on beauty and worth.\n\n### Example Analysis\nWhen analyzing specific lines, one might consider questions such as:\n- How does the poet create a sense of frustration? (e.g., through repetition or specific word choices)\n- What does a character represent in the context of the poem? (e.g., the priest as a symbol of societal hypocrisy)\n- How does the imagery contribute to the overall tone of the poem?\n\nBy systematically applying RUAE skills, readers can uncover the layers of meaning within a poem, leading to a richer understanding of its themes and language use. This method not only enhances comprehension but also fosters critical thinking about the text's broader implications in society.
