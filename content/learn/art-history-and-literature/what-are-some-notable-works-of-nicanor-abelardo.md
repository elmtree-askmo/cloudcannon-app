answer: >-
    Nicanor Abelardo (1893-1934) was a prominent Filipino composer known for his significant contributions to Philippine music, particularly in the genre of Kundiman, which he elevated to a western art-song form. He composed over 140 works, including sonatas, concerti, and chamber music, and is often referred to as the "Father of the Sonata in the Philippines."\n\nSome of his notable works include:\n\n1. **Mutya ng Pasig** - A famous Kundiman that has become an iconic piece in Filipino music.\n2. **Bituing Marikit** - Another well-loved song that showcases Abelardo's lyrical style.\n3. **Nasaan Ka Irog** - A poignant Kundiman that reflects the emotional depth characteristic of his compositions.\n4. **Himutok** - A song that captures the essence of longing and love, typical of the Kundiman genre.\n5. **Kundiman ng Luha** - This piece further exemplifies his mastery in blending traditional Filipino themes with Western musical elements.\n6. **U.P. Beloved** - The official song of the University of the Philippines, highlighting his connection to the institution where he studied and later taught.\n\nAdditionally, Abelardo composed the **Violin Sonata** in 1931, which is notable for its modern and Western sound, distinguishing it from his more traditional works. This composition reflects his ability to integrate Western musical techniques while maintaining a sense of Philippine cultural identity.\n\nAbelardo's legacy continues to influence contemporary Filipino composers and musicians, making him a central figure in the development of a national musical identity in the Philippines.
