    How does the concept of 'Shikiri' reflect the blending of traditional and modern elements in Japanese design?
answer: >-
    The concept of 'Shikiri,' as articulated by French architect Emmanuelle Moureaux, exemplifies the blending of traditional and modern elements in Japanese design through its innovative use of color and spatial organization. 'Shikiri' translates to "dividing" in Japanese and refers to the practice of using color as a means to create distinct spaces within a larger environment. This approach draws inspiration from traditional Japanese design elements, such as room dividers (fusuma) that separate spaces while maintaining a sense of openness and flow.\n\nIn the context of the Sugamo Shinkin Bank's Ekoda branch, Moureaux's design philosophy is manifested in several key ways:\n\n1. **Color as a Spatial Element**: Moureaux views color not merely as a decorative feature but as an integral part of the architectural experience. The use of colorful stainless-steel sticks in the bank's design serves to create a vibrant, welcoming atmosphere that encourages emotional engagement. This contrasts with the often austere and corporate aesthetics of traditional banking environments.\n\n2. **Layered Spatial Composition**: The design incorporates multiple layers of space, including courtyards and atriums, which enhance the sense of depth and interaction within the building. This layering is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture, where spaces are often interconnected and designed to foster a relationship with nature and the surrounding environment.\n\n3. **Community Integration**: The facade of the bank is designed to blend seamlessly into the neighborhood, creating a recognizable landscape that serves as a new type of corporate identity. This approach reflects the traditional Japanese value of harmony with the environment, while also modernizing it to fit contemporary urban contexts.\n\n4. **Emotional Experience**: By focusing on how color and space can evoke emotions, Moureaux's work aligns with the traditional Japanese aesthetic that values simplicity and natural beauty. The design encourages customers to linger and engage with the space, fostering a sense of community and connection that is often lacking in modern commercial architecture.\n\nIn summary, 'Shikiri' embodies a synthesis of traditional Japanese design principles and modern architectural practices, creating spaces that are not only functional but also emotionally resonant. This blending of old and new is a hallmark of Moureaux's work, showcasing how contemporary architecture can honor and reinterpret cultural heritage.
