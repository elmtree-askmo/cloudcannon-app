    How does Donne establish the tone in the first stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the first stanza of John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," the tone is established through a combination of direct address, personification, and a sense of superiority. The speaker begins by scolding the sun, referring to it as a "busy old fool" and an "unruly sun." This harsh and disparaging language creates an immediate impression of conflict between the speaker and the sun, suggesting that the sun's actions are intrusive and disruptive to the intimate setting of the speaker and his lover.\n\nThe tone of condescension is further emphasized as the speaker asserts his authority over the sun, instructing it to go elsewhere and not to disturb their private world. This establishes a clear dichotomy between the external world, represented by the sun, and the speaker's personal realm of love and intimacy. The speaker's disdain for the sun's role in marking time—seasons, hours, and days—highlights the theme that love transcends these temporal constraints.\n\nOverall, the tone in the first stanza is one of mockery and defiance, as the speaker challenges the sun's authority and prioritizes love over the natural order. This sets the stage for the poem's exploration of love's cosmic significance and its ability to transcend worldly concerns.
