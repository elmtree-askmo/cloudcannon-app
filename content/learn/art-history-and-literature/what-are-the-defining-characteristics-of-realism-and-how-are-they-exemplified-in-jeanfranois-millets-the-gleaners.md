answer: >-
    Realism is an artistic movement that emerged in the mid-19th century as a reaction against the emotional and dramatic tendencies of Romanticism. The defining characteristics of Realism include:\n\n1. **Focus on Everyday Life**: Realism emphasizes the depiction of ordinary people and their daily activities, often highlighting the lives of the working class and rural communities.\n\n2. **Social Commentary**: Realist artists frequently address social issues, such as poverty, labor, and the struggles of the lower classes, aiming to bring attention to the realities of life that were often overlooked.\n\n3. **Attention to Detail**: Realist works are characterized by meticulous attention to detail, portraying subjects with accuracy and authenticity, avoiding idealization or romantic embellishment.\n\n4. **Naturalism**: Realism often incorporates naturalistic elements, reflecting the environment and conditions in which the subjects exist, thus providing a truthful representation of life.\n\n5. **Rejection of Idealism**: Unlike previous movements that glorified heroic or romantic subjects, Realism focuses on the mundane and the unvarnished truth of human experience.\n\nJean-François Millet's painting "The Gleaners" (1857) exemplifies these characteristics of Realism. In this work, Millet depicts three peasant women gathering leftover grain from a recently harvested field. The following aspects illustrate how "The Gleaners" embodies Realism:\n\n- **Everyday Life**: The painting captures a simple yet profound moment in the lives of rural laborers, showcasing their hard work and the dignity of their labor.\n\n- **Social Commentary**: By focusing on the gleaners—who were often marginalized and overlooked in society—Millet highlights the struggles of the working class and the harsh realities of agricultural life.\n\n- **Attention to Detail**: Millet's careful rendering of the figures and the landscape conveys a sense of authenticity. The textures of the clothing, the posture of the women, and the surrounding environment are depicted with great care.\n\n- **Naturalism**: The composition reflects the natural setting of the rural landscape, emphasizing the connection between the gleaners and the land they work on.\n\n- **Rejection of Idealism**: Unlike romanticized portrayals of rural life, "The Gleaners" presents a raw and honest view of the labor involved in gathering food, devoid of any glorification.\n\nIn summary, "The Gleaners" serves as a powerful representation of Realism, encapsulating the movement's focus on the everyday lives of ordinary people while addressing broader social issues.
