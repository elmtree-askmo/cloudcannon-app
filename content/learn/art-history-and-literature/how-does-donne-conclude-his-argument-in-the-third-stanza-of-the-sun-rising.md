    How does Donne conclude his argument in the third stanza of 'The Sun Rising'?
answer: >-
    In the third stanza of John Donne's poem "The Sun Rising," the speaker concludes his argument by asserting the supremacy of love over the sun and its authority. He suggests that the sun, which typically symbolizes power and control, is actually inferior to the love shared between him and his mistress. The speaker invites the sun to revolve around them, indicating that their love is so significant that it should be the center of the universe, rather than the sun.\n\nThe stanza emphasizes that the lovers' relationship encapsulates all the beauty and richness of the world, rendering the sun's daily rise irrelevant. The speaker claims that the sun has no right to disturb their intimate moment, as their love is a microcosm of the entire universe. He even goes so far as to say that the sun should learn from them, as they embody the essence of all the kings and kingdoms of the world within their bedroom.\n\nThis conclusion reinforces the poem's overarching theme of love's transcendence and its ability to defy the constraints of time and authority, positioning love as a cosmic force that surpasses even the sun's power.
