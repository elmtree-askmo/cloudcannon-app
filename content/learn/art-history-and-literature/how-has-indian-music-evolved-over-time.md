    How has Indian music evolved over time?
answer: >-
    The evolution of Indian music is a rich and complex journey that spans centuries, reflecting the diverse cultural, social, and historical influences of the Indian subcontinent. Indian music can be broadly classified into two main traditions: classical and folk, each with its own unique characteristics and developmental paths.\n\n### Origins and Early Development\nThe history of Indian classical music dates back to the Vedic period, around 1500 BCE. The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, contains hymns that were sung using specific musical notations, laying the foundation for the earliest forms of classical music. Over time, this music evolved into distinct classical forms, such as Dhrupad and Khayal, particularly during the medieval period.\n\n### Classical Music Traditions\nIndian classical music is divided into two primary styles: Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic (South Indian). Hindustani music has been influenced by various cultures, including Persian and Central Asian traditions, especially during the Mughal era. This fusion led to the development of new musical forms and styles, enriching the classical repertoire.\n\n### Folk Music\nIn addition to classical traditions, Indian folk music has also evolved significantly. It reflects regional diversity and cultural traditions, often influenced by movements such as Bhakti and Sufi, which emphasized devotion and spirituality. Folk music serves as a means of expression for various communities and is often tied to local customs, festivals, and rituals.\n\n### Modern Influences\nThe 20th century saw a significant transformation in Indian music, particularly with the rise of Bollywood. Indian classical music has had a profound influence on Bollywood music, with many songs incorporating classical ragas and structures. Notable musicians, such as Ravi Shankar, have played a crucial role in popularizing Indian classical music on the global stage through collaborations with Western artists.\n\n### Cultural Exchange and Global Impact\nIndian music is characterized by its adaptability and incorporation of new influences over time. The interaction between different musical traditions, including the fusion of Hindu and Muslim musical elements, has enriched the musical landscape of India. Today, Indian music continues to evolve, with contemporary artists blending traditional forms with modern genres, further expanding its reach and appeal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe evolution of Indian music is a testament to its vibrant tapestry woven from centuries of tradition, innovation, and cultural exchange. From ancient Vedic chants to the modern fusion of genres, Indian music remains a dynamic and integral part of the cultural heritage of the subcontinent.
