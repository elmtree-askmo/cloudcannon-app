answer: >-
    Rosa Bonheur, born Marie-Rosalie Bonheur on March 16, 1822, in Bordeaux, France, was a prominent French painter and sculptor renowned for her exceptional depictions of animals and rural life. She is often celebrated as one of the most significant female artists of the 19th century, particularly known for her realistic style and attention to detail.\n\nBonheur's artistic career began to flourish in the mid-19th century, with her most famous works including "Ploughing in the Nivernais," first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1848, and "The Horse Fair" (French: "Le marché aux chevaux"), which was exhibited in 1853 and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Her paintings are characterized by their remarkable accuracy and a vibrant palette, which evolved over her career to include lighter tones and polished surfaces.\n\nThroughout her life, Bonheur faced the challenges of being a woman in a male-dominated art world. Despite this, she achieved commercial success and gained recognition, becoming a trailblazer for future generations of female artists. She was also known for her unconventional lifestyle, often dressing in male clothing to gain access to places where women were typically barred, such as livestock markets.\n\nRosa Bonheur passed away on May 25, 1899, at Château de By, near Fontainebleau, France. Her legacy endures, influencing discussions about female representation in art and inspiring many contemporary artists. Bonheur is sometimes cited as "the first lesbian artist," as she had committed relationships with women throughout her life, further adding to her significance in both art history and LGBTQ+ narratives.
