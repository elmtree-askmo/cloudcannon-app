    How should artwork be cited using MLA style?
answer: >-
    To cite artwork using MLA style, you should include the following elements in the citation: the artist's name, the title of the artwork (in italics), the year of creation, the medium, and the current location of the artwork. Here’s the general format:\n\n**Format:**\nArtist's Last Name, First Name. *Title of Artwork*. Year. Medium. Location.\n\n**Example:**\nFragonard, Jean-Honoré. *The Swing*. 1767. Oil on canvas. Wallace Collection, London.\n\nWhen you first mention the artwork in your text, you should provide this full citation. If you refer to the artwork again later in your text, you can simply mention the title or the artist's name without repeating the full citation.\n\nAdditionally, if you include illustrations of the artwork in your essay, they should be labeled and numbered according to their order of appearance, and you should provide a caption that includes the citation information.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that you give proper credit to the artists and allows readers to locate the artwork if they wish to explore it further.
