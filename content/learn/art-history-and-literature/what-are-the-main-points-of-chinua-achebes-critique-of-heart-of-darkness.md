    What are the main points of Chinua Achebe's critique of 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    Chinua Achebe's critique of Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," articulated in his essay "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'," presents several key points that challenge the novella's portrayal of Africa and its people. Here are the main points of Achebe's critique:\n\n1. **Racism and Dehumanization**: Achebe argues that Conrad's work is fundamentally racist, as it dehumanizes Africans and reduces them to mere symbols of savagery. He describes the portrayal of Africa as a "metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognizable humanity," suggesting that the narrative strips African people of their individuality and complexity (Achebe, 1977).\n\n2. **Perpetuation of Stereotypes**: Achebe contends that "Heart of Darkness" perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Africa and its inhabitants. He believes that the novella contributes to a Eurocentric view that depicts Africa as barbaric and uncivilized, reinforcing colonial ideologies that were prevalent during Conrad's time and beyond.\n\n3. **Impact on Perception**: Achebe emphasizes that the novella has had a lasting impact on how Africa is perceived in Western literature and thought. He argues that because "Heart of Darkness" is a widely studied and respected text, its racist depictions can influence readers' understanding of Africa, making it difficult to challenge these ingrained perceptions.\n\n4. **Critique of Literary Canon**: Achebe's critique also extends to the literary canon itself, questioning why a work that so blatantly dehumanizes a portion of humanity is celebrated as a great work of art. He challenges the notion that literary merit can excuse or overlook the racist implications of a text.\n\n5. **Call for a New Perspective**: Ultimately, Achebe calls for a reevaluation of how African narratives are represented in literature. He advocates for the inclusion of African voices and perspectives that counter the dominant narratives established by colonial literature.\n\nAchebe's critique has sparked significant discussion and has influenced subsequent scholarship on "Heart of Darkness," prompting a reexamination of the themes of colonialism and representation in literature.
