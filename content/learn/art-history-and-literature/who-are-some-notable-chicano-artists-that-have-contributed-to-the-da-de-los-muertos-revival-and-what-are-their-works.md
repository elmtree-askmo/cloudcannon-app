These pieces often feature allegorical representations of life and death, as well as references to Los Angeles landscapes.\n\n5. **Mario Ybarra Jr.**: A contemporary artist who engages with cultural themes through workshops and community art projects, Ybarra's work reflects the ongoing evolution of Día de los Muertos in modern contexts.
