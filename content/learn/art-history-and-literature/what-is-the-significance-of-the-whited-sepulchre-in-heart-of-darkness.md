    What is the significance of the 'Whited Sepulchre' in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*, the term "Whited Sepulchre" carries significant symbolic weight, drawing from biblical references to illustrate the hypocrisy of colonialism. The phrase originates from Matthew 23:27-28, where it describes something that appears beautiful on the outside but is corrupt and decayed within. In the context of the novella, the "Whited Sepulchre" is often interpreted as a metaphor for Brussels, the headquarters of the colonial enterprise that exploits the Congo.\n\nThis symbolism is crucial as it highlights the stark contrast between the purported civilizing mission of European powers and the brutal reality of their actions in Africa. The company operating in the Congo presents itself as a benevolent force, claiming to bring enlightenment and civilization to the natives. However, the underlying motivation is profit-driven, revealing a faÃ§ade of morality that conceals the exploitation and dehumanization of the colonized peoples. This duality reflects the broader themes of imperialism and capitalism, where the veneer of civilization masks the underlying greed and moral decay.\n\nFurthermore, the "Whited Sepulchre" serves to critique the European self-image as a civilizing force. It underscores the hypocrisy of colonial discourse, which often justified imperialism under the guise of altruism while perpetuating violence and oppression. This critique is central to Marlow's journey, as he confronts the darkness not only in the Congo but also within the European psyche, questioning the very nature of civilization and morality.\n\nIn summary, the significance of the "Whited Sepulchre" in *Heart of Darkness* lies in its representation of the hypocrisy of colonialism, serving as a powerful symbol of the moral contradictions inherent in imperialist ideology. It invites readers to reflect on the complexities of civilization, the darkness within humanity, and the true impact of colonial exploitation.
