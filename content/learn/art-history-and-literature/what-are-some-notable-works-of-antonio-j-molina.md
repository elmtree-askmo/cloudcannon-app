    What are some notable works of Antonio J. Molina?
answer: >-
    Antonio J. Molina, a prominent Filipino composer, conductor, and educator, is known for his significant contributions to Philippine music. He was born on December 26, 1894, and passed away on January 29, 1980. Molina is often referred to as the "Dean of Filipino Composers" and was recognized as a National Artist of the Philippines for his services to music.\n\nSome of his notable works include:\n\n1. **Hatinggabi** - This is perhaps his most familiar composition, a serenade for solo violin and piano accompaniment that showcases his lyrical style and mastery of melody.\n\n2. **Matinal** - Composed in 1912, this piece is part of an unpublished volume called *Miniaturas, Vol. I*. Molina described these works as combinations of melody and harmony that reflect moments of enthusiasm, passion, or humor.\n\n3. **Chamber Music and Choral Works** - Throughout his career, Molina composed a wide range of music, including chamber pieces and choral compositions, contributing to the development of classical music in the Philippines.\n\n4. **Innovative Techniques** - Molina was known for introducing various musical innovations, such as the whole tone scale and pentatonic scale, as well as the use of dominant ninths and eleventh chords, which enriched the harmonic language of Philippine music.\n\nMolina's influence extends beyond his compositions; he played a crucial role in elevating Philippine music beyond folk traditions and was a key figure in the early 20th-century classical music scene in the Philippines. His legacy continues to inspire contemporary Filipino composers and musicians.
