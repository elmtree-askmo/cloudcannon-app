answer: >-
    Modern art is characterized by a variety of defining features that emerged primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Here are some of the key characteristics:\n\n1. **Abandonment of Traditional Techniques**: Modern art marked a significant departure from traditional artistic methods and styles. Artists sought to break away from established norms, leading to the exploration of new forms and techniques.\n\n2. **Use of New Media**: Modern artists were pioneers in the use of diverse media, including collage, assemblage, photography, animation, and land art. This experimentation with materials and methods was a hallmark of the movement.\n\n3. **Vibrant Colors and Bold Brushstrokes**: Many modern artworks are noted for their use of vibrant colors and expressive brushwork, which contributed to the emotional impact of the pieces.\n\n4. **Abstract and Expressive Forms**: Modern art often features abstract forms and shapes, moving away from realistic representations. This abstraction allowed artists to explore concepts such as movement, time, and space in innovative ways.\n\n5. **Focus on Individual Experience**: Modern artists aimed to express their personal experiences and perceptions of the rapidly changing world around them, particularly in response to the technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n6. **Philosophical Underpinnings**: The movement was not just artistic but also philosophical, reflecting a desire to create new forms of art and social structures that resonated with the complexities of modern life.\n\n7. **Eclectic Styles**: Modern art encompasses a wide range of styles and movements, including Impressionism, Fauvism, and Expressionism, each contributing unique perspectives and techniques to the overall narrative of modernism.\n\n8. **Rejection of Realism**: There was a conscious move away from realistic portrayals of subjects, with artists favoring abstraction and innovation in form, color, and line.\n\nOverall, modern art represents a dynamic and evolving set of ideas that reflect the complexities of contemporary society, making it a significant period in the history of art.
