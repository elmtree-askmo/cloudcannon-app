    Why was 'Jude the Obscure' controversial upon its publication, and how did it affect Hardy's decision to stop writing novels?
answer: >-
    'Jude the Obscure' was controversial upon its publication in 1895 primarily due to its unflinching portrayal of sexuality and its critical examination of marriage and societal norms. The novel's candid exploration of these themes shocked contemporary audiences and critics, who were accustomed to the more restrained narratives typical of Victorian literature. Hardy's depiction of the struggles faced by the protagonist, Jude Fawley, as he navigates the oppressive structures of society, particularly regarding education and marriage, was seen as a direct challenge to the moral and social conventions of the time.\n\nThe backlash was severe; many critics condemned the novel for its perceived immorality and its bleak outlook on life. This intense criticism and the public outrage surrounding the book significantly impacted Hardy, leading him to make the decision to stop writing novels altogether. He felt that the response to 'Jude the Obscure' was indicative of a broader societal unwillingness to engage with the uncomfortable truths he sought to address. Although he continued to write poetry, he never published another novel after this one, marking a significant turning point in his literary career.\n\nIn summary, the controversy surrounding 'Jude the Obscure' stemmed from its frank discussions of sexuality and marriage, which were at odds with Victorian values, and this backlash ultimately influenced Hardy's decision to cease novel writing.
