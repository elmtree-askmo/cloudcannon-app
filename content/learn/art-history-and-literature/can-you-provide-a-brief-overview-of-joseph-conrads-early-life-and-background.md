    Can you provide a brief overview of Joseph Conrad's early life and background?
answer: >-
    Joseph Conrad, born JÃ³zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski on December 3, 1857, in Berdychiv (then part of the Russian Empire, now in Ukraine), was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowski, a Polish nobleman and political activist, and Ewelina Bobrawska, who came from a wealthy Polish family. His father's involvement in the Polish independence movement led to the family's exile to Russia, which resulted in a tumultuous early life characterized by frequent relocations.\n\nConrad's early education was erratic, largely due to the family's unstable circumstances. His father, a translator and writer, provided him with some literary instruction, which would later influence Conrad's own writing career. Despite being born into a Polish-speaking family, Conrad did not become fluent in English until his twenties, yet he would go on to become one of the most significant novelists in the English language, known for his complex narratives and exploration of themes such as colonialism and human psychology.\n\nIn 1886, Conrad settled in England, where he eventually became a British citizen. His experiences at sea, particularly in the merchant marine, would profoundly shape his literary works, including his famous novella "Heart of Darkness." Conrad's early life and background played a crucial role in the development of his literary voice and thematic concerns.
