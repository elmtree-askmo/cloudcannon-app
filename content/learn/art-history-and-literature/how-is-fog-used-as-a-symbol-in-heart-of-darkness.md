    How is fog used as a symbol in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," fog serves as a significant symbol that embodies uncertainty, confusion, and the duality of human nature. The presence of fog throughout the novella creates an atmosphere of mystery and moral ambiguity, reflecting the complex realities of colonialism and the psychological journey of the protagonist, Marlow.\n\nFog is described as "very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night," which emphasizes its oppressive and disorienting qualities. This imagery not only obscures vision but also symbolizes the obscured truths and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. The fog represents the confusion that arises when individuals blindly follow ideologies or leaders, leading to critical decisions made in a state of uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, the fog reinforces the theme of ambiguity that permeates the narrative. It induces feelings of dread and fear, suggesting that the journey into the heart of Africa is not just a physical expedition but also a psychological exploration of the darkness within humanity. The fog, therefore, acts as a barrier that separates the characters from clarity and understanding, mirroring the moral complexities of colonialism and the self-impairing nature of imperial endeavors.\n\nIn summary, fog in "Heart of Darkness" symbolizes the uncertainty and ethical ambiguity of the world depicted in the novella, serving as a powerful representation of the confusion and moral dilemmas inherent in the colonial experience.
