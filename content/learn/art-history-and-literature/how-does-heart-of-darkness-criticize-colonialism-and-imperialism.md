    How does 'Heart of Darkness' criticize colonialism and imperialism?
answer: >-
    Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" serves as a profound critique of colonialism and imperialism, exploring the moral and ethical implications of European expansion into Africa. The novella, published in 1899, follows the journey of the protagonist, Marlow, as he travels into the Congo River basin, a setting that becomes a microcosm for the broader issues of colonial exploitation.\n\nOne of the central themes of "Heart of Darkness" is the critique of the imperialist ideology often referred to as the "white man's burden." Conrad undermines this notion by depicting the brutal realities of colonialism, where the supposed civilizing mission of Europeans leads to the dehumanization and exploitation of African natives. The narrative reveals the hypocrisy of imperialism, showcasing how the pursuit of wealth—particularly through the ivory trade—results in moral decay and violence. The relentless greed of the colonizers is portrayed as a destructive force that not only ravages the land and its people but also corrupts the colonizers themselves.\n\nConrad intricately weaves themes of savagery and civilization throughout the text, challenging the conventional dichotomy that positions Europeans as civilized and Africans as savage. Instead, he suggests that the true savagery lies within the imperialists, who, in their quest for power and profit, abandon their moral compass. This is exemplified in the character of Kurtz, an ivory trader who becomes a symbol of the dark consequences of unchecked ambition and moral ambiguity.\n\nMoreover, "Heart of Darkness" addresses the psychological impact of colonialism, illustrating how the experience of imperialism can lead to madness and existential despair. Marlow's journey is not only a physical exploration but also a psychological one, as he confronts the darkness within himself and the broader implications of colonial exploitation.\n\nIn summary, "Heart of Darkness" critiques colonialism and imperialism by exposing the moral contradictions and destructive consequences of European expansion into Africa. Through its complex narrative and rich symbolism, the novella invites readers to reflect on the true nature of civilization and the dark realities of human greed and ambition.
