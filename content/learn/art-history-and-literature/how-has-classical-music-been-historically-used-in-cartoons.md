    How has classical music been historically used in cartoons?
answer: >-
    Classical music has played a significant role in the history of cartoons, particularly from the early 20th century onwards. Initially, when animation began, soundtracks were often an afterthought, but with the advent of synchronized sound in the late 1920s, music became a crucial element of animated films. A landmark example of this transition is Walt Disney's *Steamboat Willie* (1928), which showcased the potential of synchronized sound in animation.\n\nOne of the most notable instances of classical music in cartoons is Disney's *Fantasia* (1940). This feature-length animated film was groundbreaking in its approach, pairing classical masterpieces with imaginative animated sequences. It included works from composers such as Bach, Stravinsky, and Tchaikovsky, effectively blending visual art with music to create a unique experience. The film's impact has left a lasting legacy, ensuring that classical music remains a staple in animation.\n\nThroughout the years, cartoons have frequently drawn from the classical music repertoire. For instance, the *Largo al factotum* aria from Rossini's *Barber of Seville* has been humorously featured in various cartoons, showcasing the interplay between classical music and comedic storytelling. Additionally, the *Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2* by Liszt has been extensively used in Mickey Mouse cartoons, further illustrating how classical compositions have been integrated into popular culture.\n\nMoreover, the use of classical music in cartoons often involves parodying the classical music world and the concert-going experience. This approach not only entertains but also introduces audiences to classical music in a more accessible manner. The legacy of classic cartoons has ensured that classical music continues to find a place in modern animation, even as digital effects and synthesized sounds dominate the industry.\n\nIn summary, classical music has historically been used in cartoons to enhance storytelling, create humor, and introduce audiences to classical works, making it an integral part of the animation landscape.
