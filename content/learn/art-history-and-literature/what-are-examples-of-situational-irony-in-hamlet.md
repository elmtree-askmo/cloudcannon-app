    What are examples of situational irony in 'Hamlet'?
answer: >-
    In "Hamlet," situational irony is prevalent throughout the play, highlighting the contrasts between expectations and reality. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Hamlet's Monologue**: In Act 1, Scene 5, Hamlet expresses his frustration about his tendency to overthink and delay action. The irony lies in the fact that he is aware of his inaction yet continues to procrastinate, which ultimately leads to tragic consequences. This self-awareness amplifies his helplessness.\n\n2. **The Play-Within-a-Play**: The most ironic moment occurs during the play that Hamlet stages to catch the conscience of King Claudius. While Hamlet intends to expose Claudius's guilt, the irony is that Claudius's reaction reveals his guilt, confirming Hamlet's suspicions. This moment underscores the unpredictability of human behavior and the consequences of deceit.\n\n3. **Ophelia's Madness**: The audience is left uncertain about Ophelia's mental state, creating situational irony. While characters in the play interpret her behavior as madness, the audience understands the depth of her grief and the societal pressures she faces, leading to a tragic misunderstanding of her condition.\n\n4. **Yorick's Skull**: In Act 5, Scene 1, when Hamlet discovers Yorick's skull, he reflects on the inevitability of death. The situational irony here is that Yorick, once a jester who brought joy, now serves as a reminder of mortality, illustrating the futility of life and the equalizing nature of death, regardless of one's status.\n\n5. **Rosencrantz and Guildenstern**: In Act 5, Scene 2, Hamlet reveals how he escaped the trap set for him in England, where Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were sent to escort him to his death. The situational irony is that they intended to betray Hamlet, but their plan backfires, leading to their own demise instead.\n\nThese examples of situational irony in "Hamlet" serve to deepen the themes of betrayal, mortality, and the complexities of human nature, making the play a rich subject for analysis.
