answer: >-
    Antonio JesÃºs Naguiat Molina (December 26, 1894 - January 29, 1980) was a prominent Filipino composer, conductor, and music administrator, widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in Philippine music. Born in Quiapo, Manila, he was the son of a government official who founded the Molina Orchestra, which likely influenced his early exposure to music.\n\nMolina's contributions to music earned him the title of National Artist of the Philippines for Music in 1973. He is often referred to as the "Claude Debussy of the Philippines" due to his innovative use of impressionist themes in his compositions. His work played a crucial role in elevating Philippine music beyond traditional folk styles, introducing new techniques and musical forms.\n\nHe studied at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, where he mastered the cello and became a soloist with the Manila Grand Opera. Throughout his career, Molina composed a wide range of works, including chamber music, choral pieces, and music for piano, violin, and voice. His first composition, titled "Matinal," was created in 1912.\n\nMolina was also a dedicated educator, serving as the Dean of the Centro Escolar University Conservatory of Music from 1948 to 1970. His legacy continues to influence contemporary Filipino composers and musicians, solidifying his status as a key figure in the development of Philippine classical music.
