    What is the role and significance of a patron saint in the context of the poem?
answer: >-
    In the context of the poem, the role and significance of a patron saint, particularly St. Francis of Assisi, are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with the themes of social injustice, materialism, and the hypocrisy of the church. St. Francis is depicted as a figure of compassion and humility, serving as a protector of the poor and animals. His teachings and life exemplify a profound connection to the vulnerable, which contrasts sharply with the modern societal neglect of these groups.\n\nThe poem critiques the church's failure to embody the values that St. Francis represented. For instance, the imagery of the dwarf sitting outside the grand churches built in honor of St. Francis highlights the disparity between the church's ostentation and the plight of the marginalized. The dwarf, described as "slumped like a half-filled sack," symbolizes the very individuals that St. Francis championed, yet he is overlooked in the shadow of the church's grandeur.\n\nMoreover, the juxtaposition of St. Francis with the priest serves to underscore this critique. While St. Francis is portrayed as a "brother of the poor" and a "talker with birds," the priest's role is depicted as more self-serving and disconnected from the essence of Francis's teachings. This contrast emphasizes the hypocrisy within the church, as the priest explains the cleverness of Giotto's frescoes rather than addressing the needs of the poor.\n\nIn summary, the patron saint in the poem serves not only as a symbol of compassion and humility but also as a lens through which the poet critiques the modern church's failure to live up to these ideals. St. Francis's legacy is invoked to highlight the ongoing social injustices and the materialism that often overshadows genuine compassion within religious institutions.
