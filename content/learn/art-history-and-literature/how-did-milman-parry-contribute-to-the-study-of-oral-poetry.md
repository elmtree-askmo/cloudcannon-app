    How did Milman Parry contribute to the study of oral poetry?
answer: >-
    Milman Parry made significant contributions to the study of oral poetry, particularly through his pioneering research on the oral-formulaic composition of the Homeric epics. His work fundamentally transformed the understanding of how these ancient texts were created and transmitted.\n\n1. **Oral-Formulaic Composition**: Parry is best known for developing the theory of oral-formulaic composition, which posits that oral poets use a system of formulas—repeated phrases and structures—to aid in the composition and performance of poetry. This method allows for greater fluency and memorization, enabling poets to create lengthy narratives in real-time. Parry's research demonstrated that the repetitive nature of these formulas is not merely a stylistic choice but a functional aspect of oral tradition.\n\n2. **Fieldwork and Empirical Study**: Between 1933 and 1935, Parry conducted fieldwork in Yugoslavia, where he recorded the performances of traditional oral poets known as guslars. This empirical approach provided him with firsthand insights into the mechanics of oral poetry, which he compared to the structure of the Homeric epics. His collaboration with his assistant Albert Lord further enriched this research, leading to a deeper understanding of the relationship between oral traditions and the texts attributed to Homer.\n\n3. **Theoretical Framework**: Parry's work laid the groundwork for what is now known as the "Parry-Lord Theory," which explores the connections between oral traditions and the composition of the Homeric poems. This interdisciplinary approach incorporates elements of literary studies, folklore, anthropology, and linguistics, establishing a new field of research that continues to influence scholarship today.\n\n4. **Posthumous Influence**: After his untimely death in 1935, Parry's collected papers were published in "The Making of Homeric Verse," which further disseminated his ideas and solidified his legacy in the study of oral poetry. His insights have been described as revolutionary, earning him the moniker "the Darwin of Homeric studies."\n\n5. **Cultural Context**: Parry's research also emphasized the cultural significance of oral poetry, arguing that it serves not only as a means of storytelling but also as a vital component of communal identity and tradition. This perspective has encouraged further exploration into the role of oral literature in various cultures.\n\nIn summary, Milman Parry's contributions to the study of oral poetry are characterized by his innovative theoretical frameworks, rigorous fieldwork, and the establishment of oral-formulaic composition as a key concept in understanding the Homeric epics and other oral traditions. His work continues to resonate in contemporary scholarship, highlighting the importance of oral traditions in the history of literature.
