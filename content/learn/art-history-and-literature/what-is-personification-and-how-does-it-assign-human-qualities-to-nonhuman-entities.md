    What is personification and how does it assign human qualities to non-human entities?
answer: >-
    Personification is a literary device that attributes human qualities, emotions, or actions to non-human entities, animals, or inanimate objects. This technique enhances writing by creating vivid imagery and fostering emotional connections between the reader and the subject. \n\nFor example, when one says, "the tree is dancing in the wind," the tree is given the human action of dancing, which makes the description more lively and engaging compared to a straightforward statement like "the tree is moving in the wind." Similarly, the phrase "the stars winked in the night sky" personifies stars by suggesting they can wink, thereby adding a playful and imaginative element to the description.\n\nPersonification enriches narratives by making them more relatable and allowing readers to connect with the text on a deeper emotional level. It transforms ordinary descriptions into more dynamic and evocative imagery, encouraging readers to visualize and feel the scene being described. This figure of speech should not be taken literally, as it conveys a different meaning that enhances the overall impact of the writing.
