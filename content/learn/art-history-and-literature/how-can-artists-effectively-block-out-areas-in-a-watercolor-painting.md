answer: >-
    Artists can effectively block out areas in a watercolor painting using several techniques, primarily involving masking methods. Here are some effective strategies:\n\n1. **Masking Fluid**: This is a liquid that can be applied to areas of the paper that you want to keep white or unpainted. It acts as a barrier, preventing watercolor paint from adhering to those areas. Artists can apply masking fluid either at the beginning of the painting process or on top of a dried wash. Itâ€™s important to ensure that the masking fluid is applied smoothly to avoid any unwanted texture. For best results, some artists dilute the masking fluid slightly to improve its flow.\n\n2. **Masking Tape**: Using masking tape is another common method for blocking out areas. It can be used to create clean edges and protect sections of the paper from paint. However, artists should test the tape on a spare piece of the same watercolor paper to ensure it does not tear the surface when removed, especially with high-quality papers like Arches 140 lb. cold press.\n\n3. **Candle Wax**: Some artists use candle wax as a masking technique. By applying wax to the areas they want to protect, they can paint over it, and once the painting is complete, the wax can be removed to reveal the untouched paper beneath.\n\n4. **Plastic Wrap**: For larger areas, artists may find it easier to cover the area with plastic wrap and seal it around the edges with liquid masking. This method can be less damaging to the paper and brushes compared to traditional masking techniques.\n\n5. **Planning and Composition**: Before starting, artists should plan their composition carefully. This includes deciding which areas need to be blocked out and how to approach the painting workflow. A well-thought-out plan can minimize the need for corrections later on.\n\nBy employing these techniques, artists can effectively manage the application of color in their watercolor paintings, preserving the brightness and energy of their work while maintaining control over the areas they wish to keep untouched.
