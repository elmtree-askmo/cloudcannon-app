    What does the Congo River symbolize in 'Heart of Darkness'?
answer: >-
    In Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," the Congo River serves as a powerful symbol that encapsulates both the physical and psychological journeys undertaken by the protagonist, Marlow. The river represents a passage into the unknown, reflecting the exploration of not only the African continent but also the darker aspects of human nature.\n\nThe Congo River is emblematic of Marlow's voyage into the heart of Africa, which parallels his deeper exploration into the "heart of darkness" within himself and humanity at large. As Marlow travels along the river, he confronts the brutal realities of colonialism and the moral ambiguities that accompany it. The river thus symbolizes the duality of existenceâ€”both life and death, civilization and savagery, as well as the potential for evil that resides within every individual.\n\nMoreover, the journey along the Congo River highlights the corrupting influence of the wilderness and the impact of imperialism on the human psyche. Marlow's encounters, particularly with Kurtz, force him to grapple with the darkness that lies beneath the surface of civilization, ultimately questioning his own morality and the nature of humanity itself.\n\nIn summary, the Congo River in "Heart of Darkness" is a multifaceted symbol that represents the journey into the unknown, the exploration of the human soul, and the confrontation with the inherent darkness within humanity.
