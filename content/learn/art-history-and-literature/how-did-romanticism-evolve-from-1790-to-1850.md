    How did Romanticism evolve from 1790 to 1850?
answer: >-
    Romanticism evolved significantly from 1790 to 1850, marking a profound shift in artistic, literary, and intellectual thought in Europe and beyond. This movement emerged as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and rationality, drawing inspiration from earlier German Counter-Enlightenment ideas, particularly the Sturm und Drang movement, which celebrated emotion and individual experience.\n\n### Key Phases of Romanticism\n\n1. **Early Romanticism (1790-1805)**: The movement began to take shape around 1790, influenced heavily by the political upheaval of the French Revolution. Writers and artists sought to express deep emotional experiences and a connection to nature, emphasizing the importance of individual feelings and the sublime beauty of the natural world. This period saw the emergence of key figures such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose works like "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" highlighted the power of nature and personal reflection.\n\n2. **Cultural Nationalism (1805-1830s)**: The second phase of Romanticism, from about 1805 to the 1830s, was characterized by a surge in cultural nationalism. Writers and artists began to explore and celebrate their national identities, often drawing on folklore, medieval history, and local traditions. This period saw the rise of notable figures such as Victor Hugo in France and the BrontÃ« sisters in England, who focused on themes of individual heroism and the exploration of the self.\n\n3. **Mature Romanticism (1830-1850)**: By the 1830s, Romanticism had matured, with a broader acceptance of its themes and styles across Europe. The movement began to incorporate more complex emotional states, including isolation and melancholy, as seen in the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley. This era also witnessed a fascination with the exotic and the mysterious, as well as a preoccupation with the darker aspects of human experience.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\nRomanticism is marked by several defining characteristics:\n- **Emphasis on Emotion**: Romantic writers prioritized emotion over reason, valuing personal feelings and experiences.\n- **Celebration of Nature**: Nature was seen as a powerful, healing force, often depicted as a source of inspiration and spiritual truth.\n- **Focus on the Individual**: The movement celebrated individualism, portraying the artist as a unique creator whose personal vision was paramount.\n- **Interest in the Supernatural**: Many Romantic works explored supernatural themes, reflecting a fascination with the unknown and the mystical.\n- **Melancholy and Isolation**: A sense of melancholy and the exploration of isolation became prevalent, often reflecting the struggles of the individual against societal norms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy 1850, Romanticism had established itself as a dominant cultural force, influencing not only literature but also art, music, and philosophy. Its legacy continues to resonate in contemporary literature, where themes of individualism, emotional depth, and a connection to nature remain prevalent. The movement's emphasis on personal experience and the exploration of the human condition laid the groundwork for subsequent literary movements, including Modernism.
