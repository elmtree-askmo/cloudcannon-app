    Dr. Rodolfo S. Cornejo was a prominent Filipino composer, pianist, and conductor, born on May 15, 1909, in Manila, Philippines. He was the son of Miguel Cornejo, Sr. and Crisanta Soldevilla. Cornejo displayed exceptional musical talent from a young age; he became a church organist at the age of 8 and began composing music by the age of 10. His first published composition, a military march titled "Salute," was dedicated to then Governor-General Leonard Wood and was published when he was just 13 years old.\n\nCornejo pursued formal music education, earning a Teacher's Diploma in piano and in theory and composition from the Conservatory of Music at the University of the Philippines in 1930. He furthered his studies at the Chicago Musical College, where he obtained a Bachelor of Music in 1932 and a Master of Music in 1933. He also earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Neotarian College of Philosophy in Kansas City.\n\nThroughout his career, Cornejo was a prolific composer, writing over 300 works that spanned various genres, from classical to popular music. He was a founding member of the League of Filipino Composers and contributed significantly to the development of contemporary music in the Philippines. In 1949, he married Nieves Guerrero, a lyric soprano, and they had five children together.\n\nDr. Rodolfo S. Cornejo passed away on August 11, 1991, leaving behind a rich legacy in Philippine music and a lasting influence on future generations of composers. His contributions to the field have solidified his status as a key figure in the history of contemporary music in the Philippines.
