    How did Neo-Impressionism differ from Impressionism in terms of subject matter?
answer: >-
    Neo-Impressionism differed from Impressionism primarily in its approach to subject matter, as well as its underlying philosophical and technical foundations.\n\n1. **Scientific Approach**: Neo-Impressionism, spearheaded by artists like Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, emphasized a scientific approach to color and composition. This was a departure from the more spontaneous and emotional expressions of Impressionism. Neo-Impressionists employed techniques such as Pointillism, where pure colors were applied in small dots, allowing for a more systematic exploration of color theory and its effects on perception.\n\n2. **Geometric Composition**: While Impressionism often focused on capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere in a more fluid and organic manner, Neo-Impressionism introduced a more structured and geometric composition. This shift allowed artists to explore the relationships between colors and forms more rigorously, leading to a different representation of subject matter.\n\n3. **Themes and Subject Matter**: Impressionists typically depicted scenes of everyday life, nature, and the effects of light, often focusing on the momentary and transient aspects of their subjects. In contrast, Neo-Impressionists expanded their thematic scope to include more explicit social commentary and reflections on modern life. For instance, Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" not only captures a leisurely scene but also comments on social classes and the isolation of individuals within urban settings.\n\n4. **Exploration of Modern Life**: Neo-Impressionism emerged during a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which influenced artists to explore themes related to modernity, technology, and social issues. This focus on contemporary life and social commentary marked a significant evolution from the more idyllic and pastoral themes often found in Impressionist works.\n\n5. **Isolation and Social Classes**: Neo-Impressionist works frequently portrayed the isolation of individuals within the urban environment, reflecting the complexities of modern life. This was a notable shift from the Impressionist focus on the beauty of nature and light, as Neo-Impressionists like Seurat and Signac began to address the social dynamics and class distinctions present in society.\n\nIn summary, while both movements shared a common interest in light and color, Neo-Impressionism's scientific techniques, geometric compositions, and broader thematic explorations set it apart from Impressionism, allowing for a more nuanced commentary on the social and cultural changes of the late 19th century.
