answer: >-
    The stages of speech sound development in children typically follow a predictable pattern, although individual variations are common. Based on the gathered information, here are the key stages of speech sound development from birth to around 5 years of age:\n\n1. **Birth to 6 Months**:\n   - Babies begin to coo, producing sounds like "oo," "ee," and "ah."\n   - They respond to sounds by turning their heads and making eye contact.\n   - Vocalizations express pleasure and displeasure, such as laughing or crying.\n\n2. **6 to 11 Months**:\n   - Infants start babbling, producing repetitive consonant-vowel combinations like "ba-ba" or "ma-ma."\n   - They may say "ma-ma" or "da-da" without specific meaning.\n   - They begin to understand simple commands, such as "no-no," and try to imitate sounds.\n\n3. **12 to 17 Months**:\n   - Children typically say their first words, which may not be pronounced clearly.\n   - They can label objects or people with 2 to 3 words.\n   - They start using plurals and regular past tense verbs.\n\n4. **18 to 23 Months**:\n   - Vocabulary expands to about 50 words, though pronunciation may still be unclear.\n   - Children begin to combine words into simple phrases, such as "more milk."\n   - They start using pronouns like "mine."\n\n5. **2 to 3 Years**:\n   - Children use 3-word sentences and understand some spatial concepts (e.g., "in," "on").\n   - Their speech becomes more accurate, but they may still omit ending sounds.\n   - They can express simple ideas and feelings.\n\n6. **3 to 4 Years**:\n   - At this stage, children can use most speech sounds, although they may distort some complex sounds (e.g., "l," "r," "s," "sh").\n   - They can describe the use of objects and engage in playful language, enjoying rhymes and jokes.\n   - Strangers can understand much of what they say.\n\n7. **4 to 5 Years**:\n   - Speech is generally understandable, but children may still struggle with longer or more complex words.\n   - They begin to use compound and complex sentences and can answer "why" questions.\n   - Vocabulary continues to grow, and they can carry out multi-step directions.\n\nThese stages highlight the typical progression of speech sound development in children, which is crucial for effective communication and language skills. If there are concerns about a child's speech development, it is advisable to consult a speech-language pathologist for evaluation and support.
