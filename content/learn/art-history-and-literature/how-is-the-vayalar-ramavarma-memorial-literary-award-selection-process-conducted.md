    How is the Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Literary Award selection process conducted?
answer: >-
    The Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Literary Award is an esteemed literary accolade presented annually in Kerala, India, for the best literary work in the Malayalam language. Instituted in 1977 by the Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Trust in memory of the renowned poet and lyricist Vayalar Ramavarma, the award has evolved over the years.\n\nThe selection process for the award involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Initial Consideration**: A panel of judges reviews a large number of submissions. For instance, in the recent selection, around 300 books were considered in the initial round.\n\n2. **Shortlisting**: From the initial pool, a smaller number of works are shortlisted for final consideration. In the latest award cycle, six books advanced to this final selection stage.\n\n3. **Final Selection**: The panel, which typically includes notable authors and literary figures, evaluates the shortlisted works and selects the winner. For example, Ashokan Charuvil was awarded the 48th Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Literary Award for his novel "Kattoorkadavu," chosen by a panel that included authors Benyamin, Gracy, and Professor KS Ravikumar.\n\n4. **Award Presentation**: The award, which now carries a prize of â‚¹1,00,000, along with a silver plate and a citation, is presented annually on October 27, coinciding with the death anniversary of Vayalar Ramavarma.\n\nThis structured selection process ensures that the award recognizes outstanding contributions to Malayalam literature, maintaining its prestige and relevance in the literary community.
