    What is the purpose of constructive lines in drawing?
answer: >-
    The purpose of constructive lines in drawing is to establish and clarify the spatial relationships between the objects being depicted. These straight lines serve as a foundational framework that helps artists visualize the dimensions, positions, and proportions of various elements within a scene. By using constructive lines, artists can create a 'skeleton' of their drawing, which aids in understanding depth and perspective.\n\nConstructive lines allow artists to see how the marks they make relate to one another, particularly in terms of overlap and alignment. This technique is especially useful when drawing from life, as it encourages a more accurate representation of the objects in three-dimensional space. For instance, when working on a still life composition, an artist might begin by sketching constructive lines to outline the positions of the objects before adding more detailed features.\n\nAdditionally, there are some guidelines to follow when using constructive lines: they should not be erased, and it's recommended to start drawing them from the center of the page, extending them to the edges. This approach helps maintain a clear structure throughout the drawing process, ultimately leading to a more cohesive and balanced composition.
