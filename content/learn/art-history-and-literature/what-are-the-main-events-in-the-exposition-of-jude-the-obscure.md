    What are the main events in the exposition of "Jude the Obscure"?
answer: >-
    In the exposition of Thomas Hardy's "Jude the Obscure," several key events and elements are introduced that set the stage for the novel's exploration of themes such as ambition, social class, and the constraints of Victorian society.\n\n1. **Introduction of Jude Fawley**: The novel begins with Jude Fawley, an 11-year-old orphan, who is living with his great-aunt, Drusilla Fawley, in the village of Marygreen. This setting establishes Jude's humble beginnings and the challenges he faces as a member of the working class.\n\n2. **Jude's Aspirations**: Jude is portrayed as an ambitious young man who dreams of studying at the prestigious university in Christminster. His aspirations are inspired by his former teacher, Richard Phillotson, who had similar ambitions. This desire for education and social mobility is a central aspect of Jude's character and foreshadows the struggles he will encounter.\n\n3. **Jude's Education**: The exposition highlights Jude's self-education as he begins to teach himself classical languages, indicating his determination to rise above his circumstances. This aspect of his character is crucial as it reflects the theme of aspiration against societal limitations.\n\n4. **Setting and Historical Context**: The novel is set in Wessex, a fictional representation of southwestern England during the Victorian era, a time characterized by strict social norms and expectations, particularly regarding marriage and morality. This context is essential for understanding the societal pressures that Jude will face throughout the narrative.\n\n5. **Introduction of Key Characters**: The exposition also introduces other significant characters, including Arabella Donn, who later becomes Jude's first wife, and Sue Bridehead, who plays a pivotal role in Jude's life and emotional journey. Their relationships with Jude are central to the unfolding plot and themes of love, morality, and societal expectations.\n\nThese elements in the exposition establish the foundation for the conflicts and themes that Hardy will explore throughout "Jude the Obscure," particularly the tension between personal aspirations and societal constraints.
