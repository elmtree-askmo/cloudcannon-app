    What is the primary purpose of literary theory?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of literary theory is to provide a systematic framework for analyzing and interpreting literature. It serves as a set of tools that enables readers to delve deeper into texts, uncovering layers of meaning that may not be immediately apparent. Literary theory encompasses various approaches and methodologies, allowing for a multifaceted exploration of literature.\n\nSince the 19th century, literary theory has evolved to include considerations of intellectual history, moral philosophy, and social philosophy, among other interdisciplinary themes. This evolution has led to the development of different schools of thought, such as formalism, structuralism, and post-structuralism, each offering unique perspectives on how to critique and understand literary works.\n\nBy employing literary theory, readers can explore various aspects of a narrative, including character psychology, historical and sociopolitical contexts, and the structural elements of the text. This analytical approach not only enhances the appreciation of literature but also encourages critical thinking about the intentions of authors and the broader implications of their works.\n\nIn summary, literary theory is essential for interpreting literature, as it provides the necessary tools and frameworks to analyze texts critically and understand their complexities.
