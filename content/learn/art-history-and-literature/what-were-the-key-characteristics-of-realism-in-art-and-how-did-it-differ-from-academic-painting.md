answer: >-
    Realism in art emerged in the mid-19th century as a reaction against the idealized representations of subjects found in Romanticism and the formalized techniques of Academic painting. Here are the key characteristics of Realism and how it differs from Academic Painting:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Realism:\n1. **Objective Representation**: Realism focuses on the accurate depiction of everyday life without idealization. Artists aimed to portray subjects as they are, including their imperfections and details, rather than embellishing them.\n\n2. **Attention to Detail**: Realist artists emphasized accuracy and detail, often depicting ordinary life in a straightforward manner. This included a focus on the textures, colors, and lighting of the scenes they portrayed.\n\n3. **Focus on Ordinary People**: Unlike Academic painting, which often depicted historical, mythological, or religious subjects, Realism concentrated on the lives of common people, showcasing their struggles and daily activities.\n\n4. **Photographic Accuracy**: Realism sought to achieve a level of detail that resembled photographic representation, capturing the essence of contemporary subjects and settings.\n\n5. **Social Commentary**: Many Realist works included elements of social critique, reflecting the political and social issues of the time, such as the plight of the working class and the effects of industrialization.\n\n6. **Rough Appearance**: Realist art often had a rougher appearance compared to the polished finish of Academic painting, which contributed to its authenticity and directness.\n\n### Differences from Academic Painting:\n1. **Subject Matter**: Academic painting typically focused on grand historical, religious, or mythological themes, often idealizing the subjects. In contrast, Realism depicted the mundane aspects of everyday life and the experiences of ordinary people.\n\n2. **Idealization vs. Realism**: Academic artists often idealized their subjects, presenting them in a way that conformed to societal standards of beauty and virtue. Realist artists rejected this idealization, opting instead for a more truthful representation of their subjects.\n\n3. **Technique and Style**: Academic painting adhered to strict rules of composition, perspective, and technique, often resulting in highly polished works. Realism, however, embraced a more spontaneous and less formal approach, focusing on the raw and unembellished aspects of life.\n\n4. **Audience and Purpose**: Academic art was often created for wealthy patrons and institutions, aiming to please and conform to their tastes. Realism, on the other hand, sought to engage with broader social issues and resonate with the experiences of the general populace.\n\nIn summary, Realism marked a significant shift in the art world by prioritizing authenticity and the representation of everyday life, contrasting sharply with the idealized and formalized approach of Academic painting. This movement not only reflected the social changes of the time but also laid the groundwork for future artistic developments.
