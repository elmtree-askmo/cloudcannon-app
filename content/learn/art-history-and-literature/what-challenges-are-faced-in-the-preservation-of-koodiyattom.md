    What challenges are faced in the preservation of Koodiyattom?
answer: >-
    The preservation of Koodiyattom, a traditional performing art form from Kerala, faces several significant challenges:\n\n1. **Erosion of Scholarship**: According to Margi Madhu, a veteran artiste, one of the biggest challenges is the potential erosion in scholarship. Koodiyattom requires full-time dedication, and it cannot be effectively learned part-time. This creates a barrier for new practitioners who may not be able to commit fully to the art form.\n\n2. **Limited Practitioners**: With only around 100 practitioners remaining, the art form is at risk of dwindling further. The lack of new actors entering the field is a pressing issue, as the number of skilled performers is crucial for the continuation of Koodiyattom.\n\n3. **Lack of Performance Opportunities**: There is a scarcity of full-length performance opportunities for Koodiyattom, which limits exposure and patronage. This lack of visibility can hinder the art form's growth and relevance in contemporary society.\n\n4. **Patronage and Support**: There is an urgent need for immediate support from both the government and society. Without adequate funding and patronage, the preservation efforts may not be sustainable.\n\n5. **Balancing Preservation with Innovation**: Cultural institutions and scholars are working to ensure that Koodiyattom remains a living tradition. However, balancing the preservation of traditional elements with the need for innovation to attract modern audiences poses a challenge.\n\n6. **Caste Restrictions**: Despite progress in social reforms, the performance spaces for Koodiyattom, particularly koothambalams, remain restricted to certain castes, limiting broader participation and appreciation of the art form.\n\n7. **Environmental Threats**: The historical integrity of performance spaces is threatened by damage from weather and pests, which can affect the preservation of the art form's physical and cultural heritage.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for concerted efforts to ensure that Koodiyattom not only survives but thrives as a vital part of Kerala's cultural heritage.
