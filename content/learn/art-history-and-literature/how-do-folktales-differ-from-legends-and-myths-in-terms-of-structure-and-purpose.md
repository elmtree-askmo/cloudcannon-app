    Folktales, legends, and myths are distinct forms of storytelling that serve different purposes and exhibit unique structural characteristics. Here’s a breakdown of how folktales differ from legends and myths:\n\n### Structure\n\n1. **Folktales**:\n   - **Characters**: Typically feature everyday characters, including common people or animals, and often include moral lessons or entertainment.\n   - **Plot**: The narrative is usually simple and straightforward, focusing on a specific event or moral teaching rather than complex backstories or historical contexts.\n   - **Style**: Folktales often employ a playful tone and may include fantastical elements, but they are generally more relatable and accessible to a wide audience.\n\n2. **Legends**:\n   - **Characters**: Often involve historical figures or events, blending fact with fiction. The characters may be larger-than-life but are rooted in a specific cultural or historical context.\n   - **Plot**: Legends typically recount events that are believed to have actually occurred, often explaining the origins of a place, a tradition, or a cultural practice.\n   - **Style**: The tone is more serious than that of folktales, and legends often carry a sense of reverence or respect for the historical figures or events they depict.\n\n3. **Myths**:\n   - **Characters**: Myths usually involve gods, supernatural beings, or archetypal figures that embody the values and beliefs of a culture.\n   - **Plot**: Myths address fundamental questions about existence, creation, and the nature of the universe, often explaining natural phenomena or cultural practices.\n   - **Style**: Myths are often more complex and symbolic, using allegory and metaphor to convey deeper meanings about life, morality, and the human experience.\n\n### Purpose\n\n- **Folktales**: Primarily serve to entertain and educate, often imparting moral lessons or cultural values. They reflect the collective imagination of a community and are passed down through generations as part of oral tradition.\n  \n- **Legends**: Aim to preserve cultural heritage and identity by recounting significant historical events or figures. They often serve to inspire pride and a sense of belonging within a community.\n\n- **Myths**: Seek to explain the unexplainable, addressing existential questions and the origins of the world or humanity. They often hold sacred significance and are integral to the spiritual beliefs of a culture.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, while all three forms—folktales, legends, and myths—are integral to the oral traditions of cultures, they differ significantly in their structure and purpose. Folktales focus on entertainment and moral lessons with relatable characters, legends blend history with storytelling to preserve cultural identity, and myths explore profound existential questions through symbolic narratives. Each serves a unique role in shaping cultural understanding and continuity.
