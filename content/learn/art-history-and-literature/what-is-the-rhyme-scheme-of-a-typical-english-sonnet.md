    What is the rhyme scheme of a typical English sonnet?
answer: >-
    The rhyme scheme of a typical English sonnet, also known as the Shakespearean sonnet, is structured as follows: ABABCDCDEFEFGG. This means that the first and third lines rhyme, the second and fourth lines rhyme, and this pattern continues through the three quatrains, culminating in a final rhymed couplet.\n\nIn addition to the rhyme scheme, the English sonnet consists of 14 lines divided into three quatrains and a final couplet. Each quatrain typically presents a different aspect of the central theme or problem, while the couplet offers a resolution or commentary. This structure allows poets to develop their arguments or narratives in a cohesive manner, enhancing the emotional and intellectual impact of the poem.\n\nFor example, in John Donne's "Death Be Not Proud," the poem employs a different rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDDC EE, which blends elements of both English and Italian sonnet forms. This variation in rhyme scheme contributes to the poem's musical quality and reinforces its arguments through rhythm, further enhancing the overall emotional impact.
