    When handling and preparing clay before use, following best practices is essential to ensure optimal workability and quality in your pottery projects. Here are some key steps to consider:\n\n1. **Assess the Clay's Condition**: Start by taking a handful of clay, about the size of an orange, and feel its texture. If the clay is firm and difficult to shape or crumbly, it may be too dry. In such cases, allow it to dry out completely and then rehydrate it.\n\n2. **Gather Essential Tools**: Before you begin, ensure you have all necessary tools at hand, including clay, water, a pottery wheel, bats, and various throwing tools. A clean and lubricated wheel is crucial for smooth operation.\n\n3. **Wedging**: This is a critical step in preparing clay. Knead and wedge the clay to eliminate air bubbles and achieve a consistent texture. Cut the clay into manageable wedges to make handling easier. If your clay feels too dry, lightly dampen your work surface while wedging; this will help the clay absorb moisture without becoming overly slippery.\n\n4. **Moisture Management**: If the clay is too wet, you can wedge it on a plaster slab or board, which will absorb excess moisture. Conversely, if the clay is too dry, you can slowly pour a small amount of water while mixing to achieve the desired consistency.\n\n5. **Setting Up the Wheel**: Before molding your clay, ensure the pottery wheel is set up correctly. Attach a bat to the wheel head and secure it with clay or bat pins. Make sure the wheel is rotating in the correct direction (counter-clockwise for right-handed users and clockwise for left-handed users).\n\n6. **Final Preparation**: Once the clay is wedged and at the right moisture level, you can roll it into a flat slab or shape it as needed for your project. This step is crucial for shaping your pottery effectively.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that your clay is well-prepared for use, leading to better results in your pottery-making endeavors.
