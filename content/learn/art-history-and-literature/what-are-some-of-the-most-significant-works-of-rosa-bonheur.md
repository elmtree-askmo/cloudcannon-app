answer: >-
    Rosa Bonheur, born Marie-Rosalie Bonheur on March 16, 1822, was a prominent French artist renowned for her exceptional animal paintings and her significant contributions to the art world in the 19th century. Some of her most significant works include:\n\n1. **The Horse Fair (Le marché aux chevaux)** (1852–1855) - This is perhaps Bonheur's most famous painting, measuring an impressive sixteen feet in length. It was first unveiled at the Paris Salon of 1853 and is celebrated for its dynamic composition featuring numerous horses and figures, showcasing her mastery of realism. The painting is currently housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\n2. **Ploughing in the Nivernais** (1848) - This work was first exhibited at the Paris Salon and is now part of the collection at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. It depicts a rural scene with oxen plowing a field, highlighting Bonheur's ability to capture the relationship between humans and animals in agricultural settings.\n\n3. **Sheep by the Sea** (1865) - This painting is part of the collection at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. It reflects Bonheur's skill in portraying animals in natural landscapes, emphasizing harmony between nature and her subjects.\n\n4. **King of the Forest** - Although Bonheur painted several stags throughout her career, she regarded this particular work as one of her masterpieces, showcasing her detailed and realistic approach to animal representation.\n\n5. **Two Rabbits** (1840) - This early work is housed in the Musée des Beaux Arts in Bordeaux, France, and exemplifies her early talent in capturing the essence of animals.\n\nRosa Bonheur's legacy as a pioneering female artist continues to inspire and influence contemporary discussions about women in art and the representation of nature. Her works are celebrated not only for their artistic merit but also for their role in advancing the visibility of female artists in a predominantly male-dominated field.
