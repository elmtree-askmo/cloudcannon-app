    How does 'Sur-Natures' reflect Chevalier's view of nature?
answer: >-
    Miguel Chevalier's work "Sur-Natures" reflects his view of nature as an interactive and dynamic entity rather than a static backdrop. This installation, subtitled "Paradis artificiel," is a generative and interactive virtual garden that invites spectators to engage with the artwork in real-time. The garden consists of fifteen luminescent, stringy plants that are created and evolve according to their "morphologenetic code," which allows them to be born, grow, and die in a continuous cycle. This aspect of the installation emphasizes the idea of nature as a living system that responds to human interaction.\n\nChevalier critiques anthropocentrism through "Sur-Natures" by positioning the spectator as an active participant in the creation and evolution of the virtual environment. The installation challenges traditional representations of nature by allowing viewers to influence the garden's growth and appearance, thereby fostering a sense of connection and responsibility towards the natural world. This interactive experience encourages reflection on the relationship between humans and nature, highlighting the importance of ecological awareness in the digital age.\n\nOverall, "Sur-Natures" embodies Chevalier's vision of nature as a collaborative and evolving force, where technology and art intersect to create a new understanding of the natural world.
