    What are the main philosophical ideas of existential criticism, and how do they manifest in characters' struggles for meaning?
answer: >-
    Existential Criticism is a literary approach that examines texts through the lens of existential philosophy, which emphasizes the individual's quest for meaning in a universe that often appears indifferent or absurd. The main philosophical ideas of existential criticism include:\n\n1. **Individual Freedom and Choice**: Central to existentialism is the belief that individuals possess the freedom to make choices that define their existence. This freedom is often accompanied by the burden of responsibility, as characters must confront the consequences of their actions.\n\n2. **Search for Meaning**: Characters in existential literature frequently grapple with the question of meaning in their lives. They may find themselves in situations where traditional values and beliefs are challenged, leading to a profound inquiry into their purpose and identity.\n\n3. **Alienation and Isolation**: Existential criticism often highlights the theme of alienation, where characters feel disconnected from society, others, or even themselves. This sense of isolation can lead to existential crises, prompting characters to confront the absurdity of their existence.\n\n4. **Authenticity**: The pursuit of authenticity is a key theme, as characters strive to live in accordance with their true selves rather than conforming to societal expectations. This struggle often involves rejecting external definitions of meaning and embracing personal truths.\n\n5. **Confrontation with Nothingness**: Existentialism posits that life is inherently devoid of predetermined meaning, leading characters to confront the concept of nothingness. This confrontation can evoke feelings of anguish and absurdity, as individuals navigate their existence in a seemingly meaningless world.\n\nThese philosophical ideas manifest in characters' struggles for meaning in various ways. For instance, in literature, characters may experience existential crises that force them to reevaluate their beliefs and choices. They might engage in introspective journeys, questioning their identity and the values they hold. \n\nExamples of characters that embody these existential themes include:\n\n- **Forrest Gump**: His life story illustrates the existential idea of "existence before essence," where he navigates life based on the decisions of others, ultimately leading to a search for his own meaning amidst the absurdity of his circumstances.\n\n- **Macbeth**: This character exemplifies the existential struggle for power and identity. His ambition drives him to commit heinous acts, reflecting the existential belief that individuals can create their own essence through their choices, even in a morally ambiguous world.\n\nIn summary, existential criticism provides a framework for analyzing how characters confront their existence, make choices, and seek meaning in a complex and often alienating world. The exploration of these themes reveals the profound human experience of grappling with freedom, responsibility, and the quest for authenticity.
