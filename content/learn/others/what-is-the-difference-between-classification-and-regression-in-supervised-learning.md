    What is the difference between classification and regression in supervised learning?
answer: >-
    In supervised learning, both classification and regression are essential techniques used for prediction, but they serve different purposes based on the nature of the output variable.\n\n### Classification\n- **Definition**: Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict categorical labels. The goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined classes or categories.\n- **Output**: The output is discrete, meaning it consists of distinct categories. For example, an email can be classified as "spam" or "not spam," or a customer review can be categorized as "positive," "negative," or "neutral."\n- **Examples**: Common applications include:\n  - Email spam detection\n  - Sentiment analysis\n  - Image recognition (e.g., identifying objects in images)\n- **Algorithms**: Some popular classification algorithms include:\n  - Logistic Regression (despite its name, it is a classification algorithm)\n  - Decision Trees\n  - Random Forests\n  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n  - Neural Networks\n\n### Regression\n- **Definition**: Regression is another supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values. The objective is to model the relationship between input variables and a continuous output variable.\n- **Output**: The output is continuous, which means it can take any value within a range. For instance, predicting a person's age, income, or temperature are typical regression tasks.\n- **Examples**: Common applications include:\n  - Predicting house prices based on features like size and location\n  - Forecasting sales revenue\n  - Estimating temperature changes\n- **Algorithms**: Some popular regression algorithms include:\n  - Linear Regression\n  - Polynomial Regression\n  - Ridge Regression\n  - Lasso Regression\n  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Nature of Output**:\n   - Classification predicts discrete class labels.\n   - Regression predicts continuous numerical values.\n\n2. **Use Cases**:\n   - Classification is used for problems where the output is categorical.\n   - Regression is used for problems where the output is numerical.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - Classification performance is often evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n   - Regression performance is typically assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\nIn summary, while both classification and regression are vital components of supervised learning, they are applied to different types of problems based on whether the output is categorical or continuous. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate algorithm and approach for a given machine learning task.
