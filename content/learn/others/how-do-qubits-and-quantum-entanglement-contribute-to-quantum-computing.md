    How do qubits and quantum entanglement contribute to quantum computing?
answer: >-
    Qubits and quantum entanglement are fundamental components of quantum computing, contributing significantly to its power and capabilities.\n\n### Qubits\nA qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit in traditional computing. However, unlike classical bits, which can exist in one of two states (0 or 1), qubits can exist in a superposition of states. This means a qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. For instance, a system of multiple qubits can represent a vast number of combinations of states, leading to exponential growth in computational power as more qubits are added. \n\nThe ability of qubits to exist in superposition is what gives quantum computers their inherent parallelism. According to physicist David Deutsch, this parallelism allows a quantum computer to work on millions of computations simultaneously, vastly outperforming classical computers for certain tasks.\n\n### Quantum Entanglement\nQuantum entanglement is another critical phenomenon in quantum computing. It occurs when two or more qubits become linked in such a way that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. This inseparable connection allows for coordinated operations on qubits, which can enhance computational efficiency and capabilities.\n\nEntanglement enables quantum parallelism, allowing quantum computers to manipulate multiple qubits in a single operation rather than processing each qubit individually, as is done in classical computing. This capability is essential for various quantum algorithms and applications, such as:\n\n- **Superdense Coding**: This technique allows the transmission of two classical bits of information using just one entangled qubit, effectively doubling the information capacity of a single qubit.\n- **Quantum Teleportation**: This process uses entanglement to transfer quantum states between qubits without physically moving the qubits themselves.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, qubits and quantum entanglement are pivotal to the functioning of quantum computers. Qubits provide the ability to represent and process information in ways that classical bits cannot, while entanglement allows for complex interdependencies between qubits that enhance computational power and efficiency. Together, these features enable quantum computers to tackle problems that are currently intractable for classical computers, marking a significant advancement in the field of computing.
