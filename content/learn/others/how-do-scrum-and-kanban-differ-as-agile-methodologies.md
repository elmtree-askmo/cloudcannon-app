    How do Scrum and Kanban differ as agile methodologies?
answer: >-
    Scrum and Kanban are both popular Agile methodologies used in project management, but they differ significantly in their approach, structure, and implementation. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:\n\n### Scrum\n1. **Framework Structure**: Scrum is a prescriptive framework that provides a structured approach to project management. It consists of defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team), events (Sprints, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment).\n\n2. **Time-Boxed Iterations**: Scrum operates in fixed-length iterations called Sprints, typically lasting 1 to 4 weeks. Each Sprint aims to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.\n\n3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Scrum has specific roles with defined responsibilities. The Product Owner prioritizes the backlog, the Scrum Master facilitates the process, and the Development Team executes the work.\n\n4. **Focus on Deliverables**: Scrum emphasizes delivering a complete product increment at the end of each Sprint, which allows for regular feedback and adaptation based on stakeholder input.\n\n5. **Adaptation and Inspection**: Scrum encourages regular inspection and adaptation through its events, allowing teams to reflect on their processes and improve continuously.\n\n### Kanban\n1. **Flexibility and Flow**: Kanban is a more flexible methodology that focuses on visualizing the workflow and managing the flow of work. It does not prescribe specific roles or time-boxed iterations.\n\n2. **Continuous Delivery**: Kanban allows for continuous delivery of work items, meaning that tasks can be completed and delivered at any time, rather than waiting for the end of a Sprint.\n\n3. **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits**: Kanban emphasizes limiting the amount of work in progress to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks. This helps teams focus on completing tasks before taking on new ones.\n\n4. **Visualization**: Kanban uses visual boards to represent the workflow, making it easy to see the status of tasks and identify areas for improvement.\n\n5. **Evolutionary Change**: Kanban promotes gradual, evolutionary changes to processes rather than the more structured changes that may occur in Scrum.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Structure**: Scrum is more structured with defined roles and events, while Kanban is more flexible and focuses on flow.\n- **Iterations**: Scrum uses time-boxed Sprints, whereas Kanban allows for continuous delivery without fixed iterations.\n- **WIP Limits**: Kanban explicitly uses WIP limits to manage flow, while Scrum does not have this concept.\n- **Focus**: Scrum focuses on delivering increments of work at the end of each Sprint, while Kanban focuses on optimizing the flow of work continuously.\n\n### Conclusion\nChoosing between Scrum and Kanban depends on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the team. Scrum may be more suitable for projects with well-defined deliverables and timelines, while Kanban may be better for teams that require flexibility and continuous delivery of tasks. Both methodologies encourage continuous improvement and adaptability, which are core principles of Agile.
