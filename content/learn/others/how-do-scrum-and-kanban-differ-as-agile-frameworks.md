    How do Scrum and Kanban differ as Agile frameworks?
answer: >-
    Scrum and Kanban are both popular frameworks within the Agile methodology, but they differ significantly in their structure, processes, and focus. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:\n\n### Scrum\n1. **Framework Type**: Scrum is a comprehensive framework that provides a structured approach to managing complex projects. It includes defined roles, events, and artifacts.\n2. **Iterations**: Scrum operates in fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1 to 4 weeks. At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product increment is delivered.\n3. **Roles**: Scrum defines specific roles, including the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. Each role has distinct responsibilities that contribute to the overall success of the project.\n4. **Planning**: Scrum requires upfront planning to create a product backlog, which is a prioritized list of work items. During sprint planning, the team selects items from the backlog to work on during the sprint.\n5. **Adaptability**: While Scrum allows for some adaptability, changes to the sprint backlog are generally discouraged once the sprint has started, promoting focus on the current sprint goals.\n6. **Meetings**: Scrum includes regular ceremonies such as Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, which facilitate communication and continuous improvement.\n\n### Kanban\n1. **Framework Type**: Kanban is more of a visual management tool than a strict framework. It focuses on visualizing work and managing flow rather than following a set of prescribed roles and events.\n2. **Continuous Flow**: Kanban emphasizes a continuous flow of work without fixed iterations. Work items are pulled into the process as capacity allows, which can lead to more flexibility in handling tasks.\n3. **Roles**: Kanban does not prescribe specific roles, allowing teams to define their own roles and responsibilities based on their needs.\n4. **Planning**: There is no formal planning phase in Kanban. Instead, work items are continuously added to the Kanban board as they are prioritized, allowing for real-time adjustments.\n5. **Adaptability**: Kanban is inherently adaptable, allowing teams to change priorities and work items at any time based on current needs and capacity.\n6. **Visual Management**: Kanban uses a Kanban board to visualize the workflow, with columns representing different stages of the process (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Completed). This helps teams identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.\n\n### Summary of Key Differences\n- **Structure**: Scrum is a structured framework with defined roles and ceremonies, while Kanban is a flexible visual tool focused on continuous flow.\n- **Iterations vs. Flow**: Scrum works in fixed iterations (sprints), whereas Kanban promotes a continuous flow of work.\n- **Planning and Adaptability**: Scrum requires upfront planning and has limited adaptability during sprints, while Kanban allows for ongoing adjustments and prioritization.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between Scrum and Kanban depends on the specific needs of the team and the nature of the project. Scrum may be more suitable for teams that benefit from structured roles and time-boxed iterations, while Kanban may be ideal for teams that require flexibility and a focus on continuous improvement.
