    Name two popular tools or libraries used for data augmentation.
answer: >-
    Two popular tools or libraries used for data augmentation are:\n\n1. **Albumentations**: This is a fast and flexible library that supports a wide range of augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations and color adjustments. It is particularly well-suited for image data and is widely used in computer vision tasks.\n\n2. **Keras ImageDataGenerator**: This library provides an easy-to-use interface for image augmentation in Keras, which is a popular deep learning framework. It allows for real-time data augmentation during the training process, helping to improve model performance by generating augmented images on the fly.\n\nThese libraries are essential for enhancing the diversity of training datasets, which can lead to improved model robustness and performance.
