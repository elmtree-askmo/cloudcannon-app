    What are the new trajectories in heritage that subvert fascist and modernist heritage?
answer: >-
    New trajectories in heritage that subvert fascist and modernist heritage are emerging through various critical frameworks and practices that challenge traditional narratives and preservation methods. Here are some key aspects of these new trajectories:\n\n1. **Decolonial Aesthetics and Practices**: The case of Asmara illustrates a shift towards practices of reuse enacted by the native population, which subverts the original intentions of fascist and modernist architecture. By reimagining these structures through a decolonial lens, local communities can redefine their significance, moving away from the settler colonial narratives that initially shaped them. This approach emphasizes the role of local custodianship, where communities actively engage in the preservation and reinterpretation of their architectural heritage.\n\n2. **Critical Preservation**: This concept involves a nuanced understanding of heritage that acknowledges the oppressive histories associated with fascist architecture. Critical preservation advocates for a reflective approach that recognizes both the aesthetic and cultural significance of these structures while confronting their legacies of oppression and segregation. This dual recognition allows for a more inclusive narrative that can facilitate healing and understanding.\n\n3. **Reparative Justice**: The idea of postcolonial reparations extends to architectural heritage, where the focus is on addressing historical injustices through contemporary practices. This includes recognizing the need for compensation or restitution for the legacies of colonialism and fascism, which can manifest in the way architectural heritage is treated and represented. By framing preservation as a form of reparative justice, new models can emerge that prioritize the voices and experiences of those historically marginalized.\n\n4. **Global Heritage vs. Local Context**: The inclusion of sites like Asmara in the UNESCO World Heritage list raises critical questions about whose narratives are prioritized in heritage discourse. This tension between global recognition and local historical narratives can lead to a re-evaluation of what constitutes heritage. By centering local stories and experiences, new trajectories can emerge that challenge the dominant Eurocentric perspectives often found in heritage studies.\n\n5. **Architectural Demodernization**: This concept calls for a reevaluation of modernist architectural principles that perpetuate societal divisions. By advocating for practices informed by decolonial perspectives, architects and planners can create spaces that foster inclusivity and reflect the diverse histories and cultures of the communities they serve. This shift away from modernist ideals can help dismantle the legacies of oppression embedded in architectural forms.\n\n6. **Community Engagement and Custodianship**: Empowering local communities to act as custodians of their architectural heritage is crucial in subverting fascist and modernist legacies. This involves engaging communities in the decision-making processes regarding the preservation and adaptation of heritage sites, ensuring that their voices and needs are prioritized. Such engagement can lead to innovative approaches that reflect the community's identity and aspirations.\n\nIn summary, these new trajectories in heritage emphasize a critical, inclusive, and reparative approach to architectural heritage that seeks to subvert the legacies of fascism and modernism. By centering local narratives, engaging communities, and advocating for decolonial practices, it is possible to create a more equitable and just understanding of heritage that acknowledges and addresses historical injustices.
