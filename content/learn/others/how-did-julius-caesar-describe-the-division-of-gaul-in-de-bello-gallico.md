    How did Julius Caesar describe the division of Gaul in 'De Bello Gallico'?
answer: >-
    In "De Bello Gallico," Julius Caesar provides a detailed description of the division of Gaul, which he categorizes into three main regions based on the tribes that inhabit them. This division is significant as it reflects both the geographical and political landscape of the area during his campaigns.\n\n1. **Belgae**: Located in the northern part of Gaul, the Belgae were a coalition of tribes that Caesar describes as being particularly fierce and warlike. They were situated near the borders of the Roman provinces and posed a significant threat to Roman interests.\n\n2. **Aquitani**: To the south of the Belgae, Caesar identifies the Aquitani, who lived beyond the Garonne River. This group was less unified compared to the Belgae and was characterized by a variety of tribes with distinct customs and languages.\n\n3. **Celts (Galli)**: The central region of Gaul was inhabited by the Celts, referred to by Caesar as the Galli. This area was marked by a number of tribes, each with its own leaders and social structures. The Gallic tribes were known for their complex political alliances and rivalries, which Caesar often exploited during his military campaigns.\n\nCaesar's account not only serves as a military narrative but also as a piece of propaganda aimed at justifying his actions to the Roman Senate and the public. By outlining the divisions within Gaul, he emphasizes the challenges he faced and the strategic importance of his conquests in unifying the region under Roman control. This division is introduced early in the text, setting the stage for the subsequent military engagements and political maneuvers that characterize his campaigns from 58 to 50 BCE.
