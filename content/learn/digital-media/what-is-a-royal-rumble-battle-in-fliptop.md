    What is a 'Royal Rumble' battle in FlipTop?
answer: >-
    In FlipTop, a 'Royal Rumble' battle is a unique format that features multiple emcees competing against each other simultaneously. This format allows for a dynamic and chaotic atmosphere where participants can attack or diss one another in a free-for-all style. The last Royal Rumble took place at Ahon 10, which was particularly special as it served as a tribute to the late legendary emcee LilJohn by the group 3GS. Previous Royal Rumble battles, including the inaugural one and matchups involving Uprising members, have been celebrated as classics within the FlipTop fanbase.\n\nThe Royal Rumble format is one of several variations in FlipTop, which also includes formats like 'Dos por dos' (tag-team battles), 'Femcee battles', and 'Intergender battles'. While the Royal Rumble format was once common in FlipTop tournaments, it has become less frequent in recent years, with the written format now being the standard for most battles. This evolution reflects the changing preferences and styles within the battle rap community in the Philippines.
