    What changes have been made to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) mandates recently?
answer: >-
    Recently, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in India has implemented several significant changes to its mandates, primarily aimed at modernizing the certification process and addressing gender imbalances within the board. Here are the key updates:\n\n1. **New Age-Based Certification Categories**: The CBFC has introduced new age-based categories for film certification. The existing UA (Parental Guidance) category has been further subdivided into three specific age-based categories: UA 7+ for children aged seven and above, UA 13+ for those aged thirteen and above, and the traditional UA category. This change aims to provide clearer guidance for parents regarding the suitability of films for different age groups.\n\n2. **Gender Diversity in the Board**: To promote gender equality, the new rules mandate that at least one-third of the CBFC Board members must be women, with a preference for achieving a 50% representation. This initiative is designed to address historical gender imbalances in decision-making roles within the board.\n\n3. **Priority Screening Provision**: A new provision for "priority screening" has been added to expedite the certification process for urgent film releases. This aims to ensure fairness and efficiency in the certification process, particularly for films that need to be released quickly.\n\n4. **Revamped Digital Presence**: The CBFC has launched a revamped website and a new mobile app (e-Cine App) to enhance user experience. These digital platforms are designed to be more user-friendly, allowing applicants and CBFC officials to access valuable information and carry out tasks more efficiently.\n\n5. **Amendment to the Cinematograph Act**: The changes come in the wake of the Cinematograph (Amendment) Act, 2023, which was notified on August 4, 2023. This amendment aims to comprehensively address issues related to film certification, marking the first significant update in nearly 40 years.\n\nThese changes reflect the CBFC's efforts to modernize its operations and make the film certification process more inclusive and efficient.
