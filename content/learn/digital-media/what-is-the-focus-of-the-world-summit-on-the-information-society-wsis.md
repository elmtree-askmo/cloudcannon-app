    What is the focus of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)?
answer: >-
    The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) is a two-phase United Nations-sponsored summit that aims to address issues related to information and communication technologies (ICTs) and their impact on the global information society. The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003, followed by the second phase in Tunis in 2005. The primary focus of WSIS is to "build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society."\n\nKey objectives of the WSIS include:\n\n1. **Bridging the Digital Divide**: One of the chief aims of the summit is to bridge the global digital divide that separates wealthy countries from poorer ones, ensuring equitable access to information and communication technologies.\n\n2. **Multi-Stakeholder Platform**: WSIS seeks to create an evolving multi-stakeholder platform that brings together heads of state, UN agencies, industry leaders, non-governmental organizations, media representatives, and civil society to collaboratively address ICT-related issues at various levels.\n\n3. **Action Lines**: The summit developed a set of 11 goals, known as "Action Lines," which guide efforts to achieve the overall aim of building an inclusive information society. These action lines cover various sectors, including e-health, e-learning, e-agriculture, and e-governance, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n4. **Global Digital Education and Literacy**: As the WSIS approaches its 20th anniversary in 2025, there is a stronger emphasis on global digital education and literacy campaigns, as well as reskilling and upskilling initiatives, particularly in regions that require significant development.\n\n5. **Ongoing Forums**: Since the initial summits, WSIS Forums have been held periodically to assess progress and continue discussions on the implementation of WSIS outcomes.\n\nOverall, the WSIS represents a significant effort to harness the potential of ICTs for development and to ensure that the benefits of the information society are accessible to all, particularly in developing countries.
