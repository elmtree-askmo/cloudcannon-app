    What are some examples of external references in hypertext?
answer: >-
    In hypertext, external references are links that direct users to web pages or resources outside the current website or document. These external links serve various purposes, such as providing additional resources, references, or citations that enhance the content of the original document. Here are some examples of external references in hypertext:\n\n1. **Webpage Links**: A hyperlink that directs users to another website. For instance, a link labeled "Learn more about HTML" that points to an external site like "https://www.w3schools.com/html/" is an example of an external reference.\n\n2. **Email Links**: Using the `mailto:` scheme in a hyperlink allows users to open their email client with a pre-filled recipient address. For example, a link that says "Contact us" and has the href attribute set to `mailto:info@example.com` is an external reference that facilitates communication.\n\n3. **Document Links**: Hyperlinks can also point to downloadable documents, such as PDFs or Word files hosted on external servers. For example, a link that says "Download our report" leading to "https://www.example.com/report.pdf" is an external reference.\n\n4. **Social Media Links**: Links that direct users to social media profiles or pages, such as a link to a company's Facebook or Twitter page, are also considered external references.\n\n5. **Citations and References**: In academic or informational content, external links may lead to sources or references that support the claims made in the text. For example, a statement in an article might include a link to a research paper or a news article that provides further context or evidence.\n\nThese external references enhance the interactivity and depth of hypertext, allowing users to explore related content and gather more information seamlessly.
