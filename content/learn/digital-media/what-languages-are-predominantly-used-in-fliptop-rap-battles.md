    What languages are predominantly used in FlipTop rap battles?
answer: >-
    In FlipTop rap battles, the predominant languages used are Filipino and English. Initially, the league hosted battles in both languages; however, it eventually shifted focus primarily to Filipino due to a decline in the number of emcees who preferred to rap in English. The founder of FlipTop, Alaric Riam Yuson (known as Anygma), emphasized the importance of supporting hip-hop in both languages, but the local scene has gravitated more towards Filipino as the primary medium of expression.\n\nThe battles are characterized by their use of free verse, incorporating elements such as rhyme, rhythm, and figurative language, which are essential to the art form. The influence of Filipino culture and language is evident in the lyrical creativity displayed by the emcees, making FlipTop a significant platform for showcasing the linguistic talents of Filipino youth.
