    How did the Supreme Court intervene in the Technology Rules, 2023?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India intervened in the Information Technology Rules, 2023, by placing a temporary stay on the central government's notification that established a Fact Check Unit (FCU) under Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the amended IT Rules. This decision was made following an appeal filed in the Bombay High Court, which challenged the validity of the amended rules that empowered the government to identify and regulate fake news on social media platforms.\n\nThe court's intervention was prompted by concerns regarding the potential for arbitrary enforcement of these rules, the implications for social media intermediaries, and fears that government agencies could misuse the provisions to suppress free speech. The petitioners, including notable figures like comedian Kunal Kamra, argued that the amended rule infringed upon fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(a) (right to freedom of speech and expression), and 19(1)(g) (right to practice any profession) of the Indian Constitution.\n\nThis stay reflects the judiciary's role in balancing governmental authority with individual rights, particularly in the context of digital media and freedom of expression.
