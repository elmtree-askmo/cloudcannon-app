    What types of data views are available in Airtable?
answer: >-
    Airtable offers a variety of data views that allow users to visualize and interact with their data in different ways. As of now, there are nine types of views available in Airtable, with six of them accessible in the free version. Hereâ€™s an overview of the available view types:\n\n1. **Grid View**: This is the default view that resembles a traditional spreadsheet. It allows users to see and edit records in a tabular format, making it easy to copy and paste information.\n\n2. **Calendar View**: Ideal for managing time-sensitive data, this view displays records in a calendar format, making it easy to track deadlines, events, and schedules.\n\n3. **Kanban View**: This view is designed for project management and workflow tracking. It presents records as cards that can be organized into columns, allowing users to visualize progress and status.\n\n4. **Gallery View**: This view showcases records as visually appealing cards, which is particularly useful for displaying images or other media-rich content.\n\n5. **Form View**: This view allows users to create shareable forms that populate records in the table when filled out. It is useful for collecting data from external stakeholders.\n\n6. **Interface Designer**: This feature enables users to create custom interfaces from their data, allowing for tailored views that can highlight specific information or trends.\n\n7. **Summary Bar**: While not a standalone view, the summary bar provides metadata summarizations of cell values in a given field, enhancing data analysis.\n\n8. **Embedded Views**: Users can embed specific views of a table within a base, allowing for focused sharing without exposing the entire base.\n\n9. **Custom Views**: Users can create unique views by applying filters, sorting, and hiding specific fields or records to tailor the data presentation to their needs.\n\nThese views enhance the flexibility and usability of Airtable, making it suitable for various applications, from project management to personal organization. Each view can be customized to show only the relevant information for different users, ensuring that everyone can access the data in a way that best suits their needs.
