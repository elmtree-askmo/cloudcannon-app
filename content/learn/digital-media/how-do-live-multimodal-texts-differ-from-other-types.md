    How do live multimodal texts differ from other types?
answer: >-
    Live multimodal texts differ from other types of multimodal texts primarily in their performance aspect and the immediacy of the experience they provide. Live multimodal texts include forms such as theatre, opera performances, concerts, book premieres, poetry readings, and lectures. These texts typically combine four of the five modes of communication identified by the New London Group: linguistic, gestural, spatial, and aural. \n\nIn contrast, other types of multimodal texts, such as digital or print texts, may not involve live performance and can be consumed at the viewer's convenience. For example, a digital multimodal text might combine video, audio, and written content but does not require the audience to be present at a specific time or place. \n\nThe key characteristics that set live multimodal texts apart include:\n\n1. **Performance**: Live multimodal texts are performed in real-time, allowing for a dynamic interaction between the performers and the audience. This immediacy can create a unique emotional response and engagement that is often absent in static texts.\n\n2. **Interaction**: The audience's reactions can influence the performance, making each live event unique. This interaction can enhance the meaning-making process as the audience responds to the performance in real-time.\n\n3. **Combination of Modes**: Live multimodal texts often utilize a combination of linguistic (spoken word), gestural (body language and movement), spatial (the arrangement of the performance space), and aural (music and sound) modes, creating a rich tapestry of communication that engages multiple senses simultaneously.\n\n4. **Temporal and Spatial Context**: The experience of live multimodal texts is bound by time and space, as they occur in a specific location and at a specific moment, which can affect the audience's perception and interpretation of the text.\n\nOverall, live multimodal texts offer a distinct experience that emphasizes performance and audience interaction, setting them apart from other forms of multimodal communication.
