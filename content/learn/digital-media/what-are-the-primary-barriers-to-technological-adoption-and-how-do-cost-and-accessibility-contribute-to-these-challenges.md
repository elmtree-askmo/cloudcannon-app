    The primary barriers to technological adoption can be categorized into first-order and second-order barriers, each contributing to the challenges faced by individuals and organizations in integrating digital technologies effectively.\n\n### First-Order Barriers\nThese are external factors that hinder the effective integration of digital technologies:\n\n1. **Inadequate Training**: Many educators and users lack sufficient training in using digital tools effectively, leading to underutilization or misuse of technology (Hébert et al., 2021).\n   \n2. **Limited Access and Connectivity**: In under-resourced areas, there is often limited access to technology and poor network connectivity, which restricts the use of digital tools (Bai & Lo, 2018).\n\n3. **Technical Support**: A lack of ongoing technical support can leave users feeling unsupported when they encounter issues with digital tools (Hew & Brush, 2007).\n\n4. **Time Constraints**: Users often have limited time to learn new technologies or to integrate them into their existing workflows effectively (Castro-Guzmán, 2021).\n\n### Second-Order Barriers\nThese are internal factors related to the users themselves:\n\n1. **Attitudes and Beliefs**: Negative attitudes towards technology or a lack of understanding of its potential benefits can hinder willingness to adopt new tools (Fu, 2013).\n\n2. **Self-Confidence and Competence**: A lack of confidence in digital skills can prevent users from experimenting with and integrating technology into their practices (Hew & Brush, 2007).\n\n3. **Pedagogical Understanding**: Users may not have a deep understanding of how to effectively incorporate technology into their strategies, which is crucial for enhancing outcomes (Kaminskienė & Lehtinen, 2022).\n\n### Cost and Accessibility Contributions\nCost and accessibility are significant contributors to the barriers of technological adoption:\n\n1. **Cost of Implementation**: The initial investment required for adopting new technologies can be substantial. This includes costs for hardware, software licenses, and necessary infrastructure upgrades. For instance, the 2023 GEM Report highlights that the cost of digital transformation in education adds an additional financial burden on top of existing educational funding gaps, estimated at around USD 97 billion annually for low- and lower-middle-income countries.\n\n2. **Economic Pressures**: Current economic conditions, such as high interest rates and persistent inflation, create a challenging environment for organizations. These factors can limit the ability to meet technology goals in a cost-efficient manner, complicating budget allocations and leading to difficult trade-offs between maintaining profitability and investing in technology.\n\n3. **Limited Accessibility**: Accessibility issues, particularly for users with disabilities, can further complicate technology adoption. Many digital tools do not conform to accessibility standards, making it difficult for all users to benefit from technological advancements.\n\nIn summary, the barriers to technological adoption are multifaceted, involving both external and internal factors. Cost and accessibility play critical roles in these challenges, influencing the ability of individuals and organizations to effectively integrate and utilize digital technologies. Addressing these barriers is essential for fostering a more inclusive and equitable technological landscape.
