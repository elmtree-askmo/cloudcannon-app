    How has multimodal communication evolved over time?
answer: >-
    Multimodal communication has evolved significantly over time, reflecting changes in technology, social practices, and theoretical frameworks. While multimodal forms of communication have always existed—evident even in young children—its academic exploration began to take shape in the late 20th century. According to Jewitt (2008), the roots of multimodality can be traced back to linguistic theories, particularly Halliday's social semiotic theory of communication developed in 1978, which emphasized the importance of various modes in conveying meaning.\n\nOne of the pivotal moments in the evolution of multimodal communication was Richard Bolt's "Put That There" system in 1980, which showcased the potential of multimodal interfaces. Developed at the MIT Architecture Machine Group, this system integrated voice and gesture inputs, allowing users to interact with digital environments in a more natural and intuitive manner. This marked a significant shift towards recognizing the value of combining different modes of communication, such as visual and auditory signals.\n\nAs technology advanced, particularly with the rise of digital media, the landscape of multimodal communication transformed further. Digital platforms have facilitated new forms of representation, enabling richer and more complex interactions that incorporate visual, auditory, and textual elements. However, despite these advancements, educational practices, particularly in English Language Teaching (ELT), have not always systematically integrated these multimodal aspects into pedagogy.\n\nMoreover, the understanding of multimodal communication has expanded to include the study of complexity in animal communication and the classification of multimodal signals. This broader perspective highlights the significance of various semiotic resources and communicative practices in both human and non-human contexts.\n\nIn summary, the evolution of multimodal communication reflects a growing recognition of the interplay between different modes of communication, driven by theoretical advancements and technological innovations. This evolution continues to shape how we understand and engage in communication today.
