    What is hypertext and how does it differ from traditional text?
answer: >-
    Hypertext is a form of text that contains links to other documents or web pages, allowing users to navigate through related information in a non-linear manner. This structure contrasts sharply with traditional text, which is typically presented in a linear and sequential format, guiding the reader from the beginning to the end in a predetermined order.\n\nThe key differences between hypertext and traditional text include:\n\n1. **Non-linear Structure**: Hypertext allows for a non-linear reading experience, where users can jump between different pieces of information through hyperlinks. In contrast, traditional text follows a linear progression, where the reader must read from start to finish.\n\n2. **Interactivity**: Hypertext is inherently interactive, enabling readers to engage with the content actively. For example, in a web browser, clicking on a hyperlink takes the reader to another document, and navigation buttons allow them to return to previous content. Traditional text does not offer this level of interactivity; it is a static form of communication.\n\n3. **Dynamic Reading Experience**: Hypertext provides a dynamic reading experience, as readers can choose their path through the information based on their interests or needs. This contrasts with traditional text, where the reader's journey is fixed and determined by the author.\n\n4. **Use of HTML**: Hypertext is often constructed using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which provides a framework and grammar for creating links and structuring content. Traditional text does not rely on such markup languages.\n\n5. **Network of Information**: Hypertext can be likened to a network, where hyperlinks serve as bridges connecting various nodes of information. This interconnectedness allows for a more complex and multifaceted exploration of topics compared to the straightforward narrative of traditional text.\n\nIn summary, hypertext represents a significant evolution in how information is presented and consumed, fostering a more interactive and flexible approach to reading and understanding content.
