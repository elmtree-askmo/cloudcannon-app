    What were the main client requirements for the Christmas installation project in Hong Kong Mega Mall?
answer: >-
    The main client requirements for the Christmas installation project in Hong Kong Mega Mall included the following:\n\n1. **Theme**: The installation was to be centered around the theme "Colorful Candy Wonderland." This theme needed to be visually represented in all characters and elements of the installation.\n\n2. **Character Specifications**: The client requested the creation of three Christmas characters and one character representing the Chinese New Year, specifically a snake, as it was the year of the snake in the Chinese zodiac. All characters were required to align with the "candy land" theme, ensuring a cohesive visual narrative.\n\n3. **Life-Size Installation**: The characters were to be designed as life-sized 3D figures, which meant that the design needed to be both engaging and suitable for large-scale display.\n\n4. **Cultural Elements**: The incorporation of cultural values was essential, particularly for the Chinese New Year character, which needed to resonate with local traditions while still fitting into the whimsical candy theme.\n\n5. **Visual References**: The client provided photo references and mood boards to guide the design process, indicating the importance of visual alignment with their vision.\n\n6. **Budget and Feedback**: The project had to navigate budget constraints and incorporate client feedback throughout the design process, highlighting the need for flexibility and responsiveness in character development.\n\nThese requirements reflect a blend of creativity, cultural sensitivity, and practical considerations necessary for successful character design in a commercial context.
