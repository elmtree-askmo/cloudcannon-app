answer: >-
    The 'Old School' battle format in FlipTop is a variation of the freestyle format that is characterized by the use of an instrumental background. This format is commonly utilized during tryouts and allows emcees to showcase their improvisational skills while rapping over a beat. Unlike the standard written format, where lyrics are pre-composed, the Old School format requires participants to think on their feet and create lyrics spontaneously during the battle.\n\nIn summary, the Old School format is essentially freestyle rap accompanied by instrumental music, emphasizing the emcee's ability to deliver creative and engaging performances in real-time. This format, along with others like Written and Freestyle, contributes to the diverse landscape of rap battles within the FlipTop league, which has been instrumental in promoting Filipino hip-hop culture since its inception in 2010.
