    How does the structure of the media system influence normative expectations?
answer: >-
    The structure of the media system significantly influences normative expectations by shaping how media operates within its political, economic, and social environment. Normative theories, as articulated by Siebert, Peterson, and Schramm, suggest that the media adapts to the characteristics of its surrounding context, much like a chameleon. This adaptability affects public perceptions of the media's role and responsibilities.\n\n1. **Normative Expectations**: Citizens have specific expectations regarding how media should function to uphold social values. These expectations are often rooted in the belief that the media should serve the public interest, provide accurate information, and act as a watchdog against abuses of power. In Western democracies, these normative theories underpin discussions about media policy, emphasizing the media's role in democracy and the consequences of its information power (McQuail, 2010; Christians et al., 2009).\n\n2. **Trust and Credibility**: The credibility of media institutions, including fact-checkers, is influenced by normative expectations. Research indicates that users' perceptions of fact-checkers are shaped by their trust in traditional media. Some individuals view fact-checkers as elite power structures that may facilitate state propaganda, which complicates the normative expectations surrounding their role (Primig, 2022).\n\n3. **Media System Types**: Hallin and Mancini's categorization of media systems highlights how different structures can lead to varying normative expectations. For instance, in systems where media is heavily commercialized, the focus may shift from public service to profit-making, altering the public's expectations of media performance and accountability.\n\n4. **Social Responsibility Theory**: This theory posits that media should operate with a sense of responsibility towards society, balancing commercial interests with the public good. The challenges of implementing this theory in practice often stem from the inherent tensions between profit motives and the ethical obligations of media organizations.\n\nIn summary, the structure of the media system plays a crucial role in shaping normative expectations by influencing how media is perceived, the trust it garners, and the responsibilities it is believed to hold towards society. These dynamics are essential for understanding the dilemmas faced by media in fulfilling their roles in a rapidly changing information landscape.
