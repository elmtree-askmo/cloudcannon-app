    How are FlipTop rap battles structured in terms of rounds and overtime?
answer: >-
    FlipTop rap battles are structured into three main rounds, with each contender given a specific time limit to deliver their verses. The time limits for these rounds are typically set by the referee, although participants can agree on different limits before the battle. For one-on-one and two-on-two battles, the time limits generally range from 1 minute to 3 minutes, with the possibility of a 30-second increment. \n\nIn the event that a battle ends in a draw after the three rounds, overtime is applied. This overtime allows the contenders to continue battling until a clear winner is determined. The structure of the battles is designed to facilitate a competitive environment where emcees can showcase their lyrical skills, creativity, and ability to engage the audience.\n\nOverall, the format of FlipTop battles emphasizes both written lyrics and freestyle elements, although the written format has become the standard in recent years. This structure not only enhances the entertainment value of the battles but also contributes to the cultural significance of rap in the Philippines.
