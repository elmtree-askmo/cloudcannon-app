    What are the limitations of using Airtable as a database?
answer: >-
    Airtable, while a versatile and user-friendly tool for organizing and managing data, has several limitations when used as a database. Here are some of the key drawbacks:\n\n1. **Data Relationship Constraints**: Although Airtable allows users to create relationships between tables through linked records, it does not support complex relational database features such as foreign keys and advanced joins. This can limit the ability to manage intricate data relationships effectively.\n\n2. **Limited Querying Capabilities**: Airtable's querying capabilities are not as robust as those found in traditional relational databases. Users may find it challenging to perform complex queries or aggregations, which can hinder data analysis.\n\n3. **Size Limitations**: Each Airtable base is limited to 250,000 records, which can be a significant constraint for larger datasets. This limitation may prompt users to consider migrating to a SQL database for more extensive data storage needs.\n\n4. **Lack of Document Management**: Airtable does not provide the ability to build and manage documents effectively. This absence can be a drawback for users who require rich document management capabilities alongside their data.\n\n5. **No Direct Export to SQL**: Transitioning from Airtable to a SQL database can be cumbersome, as there is no direct export function. This can complicate the process for users looking to scale their data management solutions.\n\n6. **Schemaless Architecture**: While Airtable's schemaless design offers flexibility, it can also lead to inconsistencies in data structure, making it harder to enforce data integrity compared to traditional relational databases.\n\n7. **User Interface Limitations**: Some users report difficulties in making connections among tables, which can limit the customization of project management features that they need.\n\nIn summary, while Airtable is an excellent choice for specific use cases that require flexibility and ease of use, its limitations in data relationships, querying capabilities, size, and document management may make it less suitable for users with more complex data management needs. Understanding these limitations is crucial for determining whether Airtable aligns with your specific data management requirements and scalability goals.
