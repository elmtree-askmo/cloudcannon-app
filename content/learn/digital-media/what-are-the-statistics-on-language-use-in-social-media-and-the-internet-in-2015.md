answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, here are some relevant statistics and insights regarding language use in social media and the internet in 2015:\n\n1. **Social Media Usage**: By 2015, approximately 65% of adults were using social networking sites, marking a significant increase from previous years. This represented a nearly tenfold increase over the past decade. Notably, 72% of adult internet users in the U.S. were on Facebook, a figure that remained stable since 2014.\n\n2. **Language Diversity on Platforms**: YouTube was available in over 80 languages, with many popular channels incorporating content in languages other than English. This reflects a growing trend of multilingual content on social media platforms.\n\n3. **Content Language Distribution**: In terms of content languages on YouTube, 66% of the top 250 channels produced content in English, while other languages like Spanish (15%), Portuguese (7%), and Hindi (5%) were also represented. This indicates a dominance of English but also highlights the presence of other languages in popular media.\n\n4. **Impact of Social Media on Language Evolution**: Social media has been noted to democratize language change, allowing diverse users to influence linguistic trends. The emergence of micro-languages within online communities has also been observed, showcasing how social media platforms facilitate the rapid spread of new slang and phrases.\n\n5. **Traffic from Social Networks**: According to Shareaholic, the top eight social networks drove 31.24% of overall traffic to websites in December 2014, up from 22.71% the previous year. This statistic underscores the significant role social media plays in content discovery and sharing.\n\nThese statistics illustrate the dynamic nature of language use in social media and the internet during 2015, highlighting both the prevalence of English and the increasing incorporation of multilingual content.
