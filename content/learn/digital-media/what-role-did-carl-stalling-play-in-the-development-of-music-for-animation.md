answer: >-
    Carl Stalling (November 10, 1891 - November 29, 1972) was a pivotal figure in the development of music for animation, particularly known for his work with Warner Bros. on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Over his career, he composed music for more than 600 animated films, averaging one complete score each week for 22 years, which significantly shaped the sound of American animation.\n\nStalling's approach to cartoon scoring was innovative and influential. He was known for his ability to integrate music with the visual rhythm of animation, making the music an essential part of the storytelling. His scores often featured a blend of original compositions and arrangements of popular songs, which he used to enhance the comedic timing and emotional impact of the cartoons. This technique, sometimes referred to as "mickey-mousing," involved synchronizing the music closely with the on-screen action, creating a seamless connection between sound and movement.\n\nBefore his work in animation, Stalling gained experience as a theater accompanist, where he learned to use music to amplify the narrative. This background allowed him to effectively translate the humor and action of animated shorts into musical form. His scores were characterized by their vigor, inventiveness, and cleverness, making them as memorable as the animations themselves.\n\nStalling's contributions to animation music were not only significant in terms of quantity but also in their lasting impact. His work introduced many audiences to classical music through the incorporation of classical themes into cartoon scores, serving as an entry point for generations of listeners. His collaboration with sound effects artist Treg Brown further enhanced the overall experience of Warner Bros. cartoons, creating a cohesive auditory landscape that complemented the visual gags and storytelling.\n\nIn summary, Carl Stalling's role in the development of music for animation was marked by his innovative scoring techniques, his ability to fuse music with animation, and his extensive body of work that has left a lasting legacy in the field of animated entertainment.
