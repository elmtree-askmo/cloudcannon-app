    What is the default behavior of the Pack layout manager?
answer: >-
    The default behavior of the Pack layout manager in Tkinter is to organize widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget. This means that when you use the `pack()` method, Tkinter will stack the widgets one after another, either vertically or horizontally, depending on the specified options.\n\nBy default, the Pack manager places widgets in the order they are added to the parent widget. The layout can be controlled using options such as `fill`, `expand`, and `side`. For instance, if you want a widget to fill the entire space available, you can use the `fill` option, and if you want it to expand to take up extra space, you can use the `expand` option.\n\nIn summary, the Pack layout manager is best suited for straightforward layouts where the positioning of elements is linear, making it easy to create simple user interfaces without complex arrangements.
