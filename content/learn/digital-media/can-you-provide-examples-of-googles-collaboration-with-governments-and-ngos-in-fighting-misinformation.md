    Google has engaged in various collaborations with governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to combat misinformation effectively. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO)**: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google partnered with the WHO to address the spread of medical misinformation. This collaboration aimed to promote reliable and accurate health information, particularly during public health emergencies, ensuring that users have access to trustworthy content.\n\n2. **Civic Resilience Initiative**: Google has supported the Civic Resilience Initiative, which focuses on enhancing the ability of communities to withstand misinformation. This initiative collaborates with various stakeholders, including NGOs and media organizations, to strengthen information ecosystems and promote civic education.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Full Fact**: Google has worked with Full Fact, a UK-based fact-checking organization, to develop frameworks for combating misinformation. This partnership has led to the creation of the Framework for Information Incidents, which aims to provide a shared approach for addressing disinformation issues.\n\n4. **Funding for Misinformation Combat Initiatives**: Google announced a contribution of over $29 million to a newly formed group dedicated to combating misinformation and fake news online. This funding supports various initiatives that involve collaboration with governments and NGOs to enhance the quality of information available to the public.\n\n5. **Engagement with European Policymakers**: During the Fighting Misinformation online summit in Brussels, Google convened with European policymakers, NGOs, media organizations, and academics to discuss strategies for tackling misinformation. This summit highlighted the importance of collaboration across sectors to address the challenges posed by misinformation.\n\n6. **Research Collaborations**: Googleâ€™s Jigsaw unit has partnered with researchers from universities such as Cambridge and Bristol, as well as American University, to explore novel approaches to combat misinformation. These research efforts aim to develop innovative solutions to the ongoing challenges of misinformation in society.\n\nThese collaborations illustrate Google's commitment to working alongside various stakeholders to enhance the reliability of information and combat the spread of misinformation globally.
