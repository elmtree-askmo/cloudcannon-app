answer: >-
    Key interior lifestyle trends that influence popular exhibitions and design awards include:\n\n1. **Experiential Design**: This trend emphasizes creating meaningful experiences for users. It often addresses social issues and promotes sustainability, making it a focal point in many exhibitions. Designers are increasingly focused on how spaces can enrich lives and foster community interactions.\n\n2. **Sustainability**: The use of sustainable materials and practices is a significant trend in interior design. This includes the integration of biophilic design, which connects indoor spaces with nature, enhancing well-being and environmental consciousness. Exhibitions like "Interior Lifestyle 2024" showcase innovative sustainable designs that reflect this trend.\n\n3. **Minimalism**: A shift towards minimalism is evident in many contemporary designs, where simplicity and functionality take precedence. This trend is often highlighted in design awards, as it reflects a modern aesthetic that appeals to a wide audience.\n\n4. **Open Floor Plans**: The trend towards open floor plans in residential and commercial spaces reflects a desire for communal living and working environments. This design approach encourages interaction and collaboration, making it a popular theme in exhibitions.\n\n5. **Cultural Influences**: The incorporation of cultural elements, such as Japanese manufacturing culture, is becoming more prevalent. This trend focuses on craftsmanship and traditional practices, which are being transformed into modern design concepts. Exhibitions often highlight these cultural narratives, showcasing how they influence contemporary design.\n\n6. **Community-Oriented Spaces**: There is a growing emphasis on creating environments that foster a sense of community. This includes designs that encourage social interaction and provide comfortable spaces for people to gather, which is often recognized in design awards.\n\n7. **Technological Integration**: The use of technology in design, such as automatic irrigation systems for aerial gardens, is becoming increasingly important. This trend reflects a move towards smart design solutions that enhance functionality and sustainability.\n\nThese trends not only shape the aesthetic and functional aspects of interior design but also influence the themes and innovations presented at major exhibitions and design awards, such as "Interior Lifestyle 2024" and ORGATEC 2024.
