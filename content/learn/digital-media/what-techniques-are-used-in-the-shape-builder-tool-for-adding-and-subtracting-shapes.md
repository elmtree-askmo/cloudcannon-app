    The Shape Builder Tool in Adobe Illustrator is a powerful feature that allows users to easily add and subtract shapes to create complex designs. Here are the key techniques used with the Shape Builder Tool for manipulating shapes:\n\n1. **Selecting Shapes**: To begin, you need to select two or more overlapping shapes using the Selection Tool (V). Once selected, activate the Shape Builder Tool by clicking on it in the toolbar or by pressing the keyboard shortcut Shift + M.\n\n2. **Merging Shapes**: To combine shapes, click and drag across the areas you want to merge. This action activates the "Merge" mode, allowing you to unite the selected regions into a single shape.\n\n3. **Extracting Shapes**: If you want to subtract a section from the overlapping shapes, you can use the "Extract" mode. Simply click on the area you wish to remove. This technique allows you to isolate and extract specific parts of the shapes, effectively cutting them out from the larger selection.\n\n4. **Deleting Parts**: To delete specific sections of the shapes, hold down the "Alt" (Windows) or "Option" (Mac) key while clicking on the areas you want to remove. This allows for precise control over which parts of the shapes are kept or discarded.\n\n5. **Multiple Selections**: You can continue to click on different overlapping areas to extract multiple sub-regions from the shapes. After you have made your selections, you can use the Selection Tool to pick out the remaining parts or to finalize your design.\n\n6. **Efficiency**: The Shape Builder Tool is often considered a faster alternative to the Pathfinder panel commands, especially for users who become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts. It simplifies the process of creating complex shapes by allowing for intuitive merging and subtracting directly on the canvas.\n\nBy mastering these techniques, users can effectively utilize the Shape Builder Tool to enhance their design workflow in Adobe Illustrator, making it easier to create custom shapes and illustrations.
