    How do you convert milliliters to liters?
answer: >-
    To convert milliliters (mL) to liters (L), you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\nL = \frac{mL}{1000}\n$$\n\nThis means that to find the volume in liters, you simply divide the volume in milliliters by 1,000. \n\nFor example, if you have 2,500 mL and want to convert it to liters, you would calculate:\n\n$$\nL = \frac{2500}{1000} = 2.5 \, L\n$$\n\nAlternatively, you can also think of this conversion in terms of moving the decimal point. Since 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters, you can move the decimal point three places to the left. For instance, 8,000 mL would convert to 8 L by moving the decimal point three places left (8,000 becomes 8.0).\n\nThis conversion is essential in various fields, including medication administration, where precise volume measurements are crucial for patient safety.
