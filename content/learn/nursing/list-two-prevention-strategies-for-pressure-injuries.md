    List two prevention strategies for pressure injuries.
answer: >-
    Two effective prevention strategies for pressure injuries include:\n\n1. **Regular Repositioning**: It is essential to reposition individuals who are at risk of developing pressure injuries at least every two hours. This helps to relieve pressure on vulnerable areas of the skin, reducing the likelihood of skin breakdown.\n\n2. **Maintaining Skin Hygiene**: Keeping the skin clean and dry is crucial in preventing pressure injuries. This includes regular bathing, thorough drying, and the use of moisturizers to prevent skin from becoming too dry or too moist, which can lead to skin breakdown.\n\nImplementing these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of pressure injuries, especially in individuals with limited mobility.
