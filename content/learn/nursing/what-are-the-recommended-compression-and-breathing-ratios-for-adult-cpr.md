    What are the recommended compression and breathing ratios for adult CPR?
answer: >-
    The recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio for adult CPR is 30:2. This means that for every 30 chest compressions, the rescuer should provide 2 rescue breaths. \n\nIn addition to the ratio, it is important to maintain a compression rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute, with each compression being at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep, but no more than 2.4 inches (6 cm). This approach helps ensure adequate blood flow and oxygenation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio**: 30:2\n- **Compression Rate**: 100-120 compressions per minute\n- **Compression Depth**: At least 2 inches (5 cm), no more than 2.4 inches (6 cm)\n\nThese guidelines are crucial for effective CPR and improving the chances of survival in cases of cardiac arrest.
