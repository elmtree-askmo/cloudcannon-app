    What are the different types of low-flow oxygen delivery systems?
answer: >-
    Low-flow oxygen delivery systems are designed to provide supplemental oxygen at flow rates that are less than the patient's inspiratory flow rate, which allows for the entrainment of room air and results in a variable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). There are several types of low-flow oxygen delivery systems, including:\n\n1. **Nasal Cannula**: This is one of the most common low-flow systems, delivering oxygen at flow rates typically between 1 to 6 liters per minute (L/min). It is comfortable for patients and allows for the inhalation of ambient air, which can dilute the oxygen concentration.\n\n2. **Simple Face Mask**: This device covers the nose and mouth and can deliver oxygen at flow rates of 6 to 10 L/min. It provides a higher concentration of oxygen than a nasal cannula but still allows for some room air to be entrained.\n\n3. **Non-Rebreather Mask (NRB)**: This mask is equipped with a one-way valve that prevents exhaled air from entering the oxygen reservoir bag. It can deliver high concentrations of oxygen (up to 90% FiO2) at flow rates of 10 to 15 L/min, making it suitable for patients requiring significant oxygen support.\n\n4. **Compressed Oxygen Cylinders**: These are portable tanks that store oxygen under pressure and can be used with various delivery devices, including nasal cannulas and masks.\n\n5. **Liquid Oxygen Systems**: These systems store oxygen in liquid form and can be used to fill portable tanks for patient use, providing a continuous supply of oxygen.\n\n6. **Oxygen Concentrators**: These devices extract oxygen from ambient air and deliver it to the patient. They are often used in home settings and can provide a steady flow of oxygen.\n\nEach of these systems has its specific applications and is chosen based on the patient's needs, the required oxygen concentration, and the clinical situation. Low-flow systems are particularly useful for patients who are more stable and do not require high-flow oxygen support.
