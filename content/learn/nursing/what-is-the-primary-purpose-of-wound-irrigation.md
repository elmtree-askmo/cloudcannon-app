    What is the primary purpose of wound irrigation?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of wound irrigation is to clean wounds by removing debris, bacteria, and exudate. This process typically involves the use of normal saline (NS) or sterile water, which helps to reduce the risk of infection and promote a healthier healing environment for the wound. Effective irrigation is crucial in wound care as it aids in the prevention of complications and supports the overall healing process. \n\nIn summary, wound irrigation serves to:\n- Remove contaminants and foreign materials from the wound.\n- Decrease the bacterial load, thereby reducing the risk of infection.\n- Facilitate the assessment of the wound by providing a clearer view of its condition. \n\nProper wound irrigation is an essential component of effective wound management.
