    What is the composition of blood in terms of red and white blood cells?
answer: >-
    The composition of blood consists of several key components, primarily red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)**: These cells are the most abundant in the blood, making up about 40-45% of its volume. Their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and return carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen, allowing for efficient gas exchange.\n\n2. **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)**: These cells are part of the immune system and play a crucial role in defending the body against infections and foreign invaders. They make up about 1% of the blood's volume. There are several types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, each with specific functions in immune response.\n\n3. **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**: These are small cell fragments that are essential for blood clotting. They help prevent bleeding by clumping together and forming a plug at the site of a blood vessel injury. Platelets also constitute a small percentage of blood volume.\n\n4. **Plasma**: This is the liquid component of blood, making up about 55% of its volume. Plasma is primarily composed of water (about 90%) and contains proteins, electrolytes, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. It serves as a medium for transporting cells, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body.\n\nIn summary, blood is composed of approximately:\n- 40-45% red blood cells\n- ~1% white blood cells\n- <1% platelets\n- 55% plasma\n\nThis composition is vital for various physiological functions, including oxygen transport, immune defense, clotting, and nutrient distribution.
