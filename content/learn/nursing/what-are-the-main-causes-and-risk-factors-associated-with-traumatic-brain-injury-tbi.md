    What are the main causes and risk factors associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI)?
answer: >-
    The main causes and risk factors associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be categorized into several key areas:\n\n### Causes of TBI\n1. **Falls**: Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal TBI, accounting for approximately 35% of cases in the U.S. This includes falls from heights, slips, and trips.\n2. **Motor Vehicle Crashes**: These incidents contribute to about 17% of non-fatal TBIs. They can involve collisions between vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists.\n3. **Strikes or Blows to the Head**: This includes injuries from sports, physical altercations, or being struck by an object, which also accounts for around 17% of non-fatal TBIs.\n4. **Firearm-related Incidents**: Gunshot wounds to the head are a significant cause of TBI, particularly in cases of suicide, which is the most common cause of TBI-related death in the U.S.\n5. **Penetrating Injuries**: These occur when an object, such as a bullet, pierces the skull, leading to direct damage to brain tissue.\n6. **Shaking or Violent Movement**: This can happen in cases of child abuse (e.g., shaken baby syndrome) or during high-impact sports.\n\n### Risk Factors for TBI\n1. **Age**: Young children and older adults are at higher risk for falls, which can lead to TBI. The elderly are particularly vulnerable due to factors like balance issues and frailty.\n2. **Gender**: Males are more likely to sustain TBIs than females, often due to higher participation in riskier activities and sports.\n3. **Substance Use**: Alcohol and drug use can impair judgment and coordination, increasing the likelihood of accidents that lead to TBI.\n4. **Previous TBIs**: Individuals with a history of TBI are at greater risk for subsequent injuries, as prior damage can make the brain more susceptible to further injury.\n5. **Participation in Contact Sports**: Athletes involved in contact sports (e.g., football, boxing) are at increased risk for concussions and other forms of TBI.\n6. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Lower socioeconomic status can correlate with higher rates of TBI due to factors such as limited access to safety measures and healthcare.\n\n### Conclusion\nUnderstanding the causes and risk factors associated with TBI is crucial for prevention and intervention strategies. Public health initiatives aimed at reducing falls, promoting safe driving, and educating about the risks of substance use can help mitigate the incidence of TBI.
