    What are the defining features of a Stage III pressure injury?
answer: >-
    A Stage III pressure injury is characterized by full-thickness skin loss. The defining features include:\n\n1. **Full-Thickness Skin Loss**: The injury extends through the epidermis and dermis, and into the subcutaneous tissue. However, bone, tendon, or muscle are not exposed or directly palpable.\n\n2. **Visible Tissue**: Subcutaneous fat may be visible in the ulcer, and slough (yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown tissue) may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss.\n\n3. **Wound Edges**: The edges of the wound may exhibit epibole (rolled edges), and there may be undermining or tunneling present, which refers to the formation of a channel under the skin around the wound.\n\n4. **Depth Variation**: The depth of a Stage III pressure injury can vary depending on the anatomical location. For instance, areas with less subcutaneous tissue, such as the bridge of the nose or the ear, may present as shallower wounds compared to areas with more adipose tissue.\n\n5. **Assessment Considerations**: When assessing a Stage III pressure injury, it is important to document the length, width, and depth of the wound, as well as the presence of any drainage, tunneling, or undermining.\n\nThese features are critical for proper diagnosis and management of pressure injuries, as they guide treatment strategies and interventions to promote healing and prevent further complications.
