answer: >-
    Captain Supreetha C.T. is a notable figure in the Indian Army, having made history as the first woman officer from the Army Air Defence Corps to be operationally deployed at the Siachen Glacier, which is recognized as the world's highest battlefield. \n\nHer military career began when she was commissioned as a lieutenant in 2021 after completing extensive training at the Officers Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai. This rigorous training prepared her for the demanding roles she would undertake within the Army Air Defence unit. Following her commissioning, she underwent an additional one-month training program that focused on endurance and other essential skills necessary for her deployment in challenging conditions.\n\nCaptain Supreetha hails from Mysuru, Karnataka, and comes from a family with a strong background in public service; her father is a sub-inspector in the Karnataka Police, and her husband is also an officer in the Indian Army. Her deployment to Siachen not only showcases her personal strength and determination but also represents a significant milestone for gender equality and women's empowerment within the Indian Armed Forces.
