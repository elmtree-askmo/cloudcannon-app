    What is secondary active transport and how does it differ from primary?
answer: >-
    Secondary active transport is a mechanism of moving substances across a biological membrane that relies on the electrochemical gradient created by primary active transport. In secondary active transport, a transport protein couples the movement of an ion (commonly sodium ions, Na⁺, or hydrogen ions, H⁺) down its electrochemical gradient to the movement of another molecule or ion against its concentration or electrochemical gradient. This process is also known as coupled transport or cotransport.\n\nFor example, the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) found in the small intestine and kidney proximal tubules utilizes the energy from the movement of sodium ions into the cell to transport glucose against its concentration gradient. Specifically, this transporter moves two sodium ions into the cell along with one glucose molecule, demonstrating a coupling stoichiometry of 2 Na⁺ to 1 glucose molecule.\n\nThe key difference between secondary and primary active transport lies in their energy sources. Primary active transport directly utilizes ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to pump molecules against their concentration gradient. A classic example of primary active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which moves three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, directly using ATP for energy.\n\nIn contrast, secondary active transport does not directly use ATP. Instead, it harnesses the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport processes. This means that while both types of transport are considered active because they move substances against their gradients, primary active transport requires direct energy input from ATP, whereas secondary active transport relies on the energy derived from the movement of ions down their gradients.\n\nIn summary, primary active transport uses ATP directly to move ions, while secondary active transport uses the energy from the electrochemical gradients created by primary active transport to facilitate the movement of other substances against their gradients.
