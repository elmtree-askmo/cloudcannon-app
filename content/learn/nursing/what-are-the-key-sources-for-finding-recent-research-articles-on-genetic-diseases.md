    What are the key sources for finding recent research articles on genetic diseases?
answer: >-
    To find recent research articles on genetic diseases, the following key sources are highly recommended:\n\n1. **PubMed**: This is a free database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that provides access to a vast collection of biomedical literature, including articles on genetic diseases. It is particularly useful for finding peer-reviewed research articles and clinical studies.\n\n2. **Google Scholar**: This is another excellent resource for finding scholarly articles across various disciplines, including genetics. Google Scholar allows users to search for articles, theses, books, and conference papers, making it a versatile tool for academic research.\n\n3. **ResearchGate**: This platform allows researchers to share their publications and collaborate with others in their field. You can often find full-text articles or request copies directly from the authors.\n\n4. **Journals Specific to Genetics**: Many journals focus specifically on genetics and genetic diseases, such as:\n   - *Nature Genetics*\n   - *American Journal of Human Genetics*\n   - *Genetics in Medicine*\n   - *Journal of Medical Genetics*\n\n5. **University Libraries**: Many academic institutions provide access to databases like JSTOR, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library, which host a wide range of journals and articles related to genetic research.\n\n6. **Clinical Trials Registries**: Websites like ClinicalTrials.gov can provide insights into ongoing research and studies related to genetic diseases, which may lead to recent publications.\n\nWhen conducting research, it is essential to focus on peer-reviewed articles published within the last few years to ensure the information is current and relevant. Utilizing these sources will help you stay updated on the latest findings in genetic disease research.
