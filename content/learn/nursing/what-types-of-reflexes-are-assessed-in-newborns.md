    What types of reflexes are assessed in newborns?
answer: >-
    In newborns, several types of reflexes are assessed to evaluate the functioning of the brain and nervous system. These reflexes are involuntary and automatic responses triggered by specific stimuli, and they play a crucial role in the survival and development of the infant. Here are some of the key reflexes typically observed in newborns:\n\n1. **Rooting Reflex**: This reflex occurs when the corner of the baby's mouth is stroked or touched, prompting the baby to turn their head and open their mouth in search of food.\n\n2. **Sucking Reflex**: Triggered when the area around the mouth is touched, this reflex causes the baby to suck, which is essential for feeding.\n\n3. **Moro Reflex**: Also known as the startle reflex, this occurs when a loud noise or sudden movement causes the baby to pull their arms and legs in towards their body.\n\n4. **Grasp Reflex**: When an object is placed in the palm of the baby's hand, they will automatically grasp it. This reflex typically lasts until the baby is about 5 to 6 months old.\n\n5. **Tonic Neck Reflex**: Often referred to as the fencing posture, this reflex occurs when the baby is lying on their back and their head is turned to one side, causing the arm on that side to extend while the opposite arm bends.\n\n6. **Stepping Reflex**: When the sole of the foot touches a hard surface, the baby will make stepping motions, as if trying to walk.\n\n7. **Blink Reflex**: This reflex involves blinking in response to bright light or a sudden movement towards the eyes.\n\n8. **Gag Reflex**: This reflex helps prevent choking and is triggered when the back of the throat is stimulated.\n\nThese reflexes are typically present at birth and begin to fade as the baby's nervous system matures, usually disappearing within four to six months of age. The presence and strength of these reflexes are important indicators of neurological health in newborns.
