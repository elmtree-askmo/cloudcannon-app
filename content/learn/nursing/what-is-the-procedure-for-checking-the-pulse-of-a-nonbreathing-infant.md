    What is the procedure for checking the pulse of a non-breathing infant?
answer: >-
    To check the pulse of a non-breathing infant, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Brachial Artery**: The easiest place to check for a pulse in an infant is at the brachial artery. To find it, place 2 or 3 fingers on the inside of the upper arm, between the shoulder and elbow.\n\n2. **Check for Pulse**: Press gently with your fingers for 5 to 10 seconds to feel for a pulse. Be careful not to press too firmly, as this may occlude the pulse.\n\n3. **Assess Responsiveness**: Before checking the pulse, ensure the infant is unresponsive. Tap the baby's foot and speak loudly to see if there is any response.\n\n4. **Monitor Pulse Rate**: If you do not feel a pulse, or if the pulse is less than 60 beats per minute, this is considered cardiac arrest in infants. If a pulse is present but the infant is not breathing normally, begin rescue breathing (1 breath every 2-3 seconds).\n\n5. **Start CPR if Necessary**: If there is no pulse and no normal breathing, initiate high-quality CPR immediately. This involves cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 breaths.\n\n6. **Continue Monitoring**: Continue to check the pulse approximately every 2 minutes while performing CPR until emergency medical services arrive or the infant shows signs of movement.\n\nThese steps are crucial for early detection of cardiac issues and can significantly impact the outcome for the infant in an emergency situation.
