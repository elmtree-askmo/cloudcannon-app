    What is neurogenesis and how does it occur in the peripheral nervous system?
answer: >-
    Neurogenesis refers to the process of generating new neurons from neural stem or progenitor cells. In the context of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), neurogenesis is primarily active during prenatal development. The neural crest, a group of cells that emerge during embryonic development, gives rise to all neurons with cell bodies in the PNS. This process involves the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into various types of neurons and glial cells.\n\nWhile neurogenesis in the PNS is largely restricted to prenatal stages, there are notable exceptions. For instance, the olfactory neuroepithelium continues to exhibit neurogenesis throughout life, allowing for the continuous replacement of olfactory sensory neurons. Additionally, recent studies have shown that sensory ganglia in the adult PNS contain precursor cells that can proliferate in vitro and have the potential to differentiate into neurons. This suggests that while the capacity for neurogenesis in the adult PNS is limited compared to the central nervous system (CNS), it is not entirely absent.\n\nIn summary, neurogenesis in the peripheral nervous system predominantly occurs during prenatal development, with some ongoing neurogenic activity in specific regions such as the olfactory neuroepithelium and sensory ganglia in adults.
