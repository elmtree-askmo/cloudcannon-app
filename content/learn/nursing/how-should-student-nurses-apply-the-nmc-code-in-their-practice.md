Here are several ways student nurses can effectively integrate the NMC Code into their daily practice:\n\n1. **Prioritise People**: Student nurses must always put the interests of patients and service users first. This involves providing person-centered care that respects the dignity, rights, and preferences of individuals. They should actively listen to patients, involve them in their care decisions, and advocate for their needs.\n\n2. **Practice Effectively**: It is essential for student nurses to maintain and develop their competence.
