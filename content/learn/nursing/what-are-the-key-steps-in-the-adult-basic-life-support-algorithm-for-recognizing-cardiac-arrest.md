    What are the key steps in the Adult Basic Life Support Algorithm for recognizing cardiac arrest?
answer: >-
    The key steps in the Adult Basic Life Support (BLS) Algorithm for recognizing cardiac arrest are as follows:\n\n1. **Scene Safety**: Before approaching the individual, ensure that the environment is safe for both the rescuer and the victim to prevent any further harm.\n\n2. **Check Responsiveness**: Gently shake the person and shout to see if they respond. This step is crucial to determine if the person is conscious or unconscious.\n\n3. **Call for Help**: If the person is unresponsive, immediately call emergency services (e.g., 999 in the UK) or instruct someone else to do so. This step is vital to ensure that professional medical assistance is on the way.\n\n4. **Assess Breathing**: Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If the person is not breathing or only gasping, this indicates a cardiac arrest.\n\n5. **Start CPR**: If the person is not breathing, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately. For adults, perform chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, with a depth of about 2 inches (5 cm). The compression-to-breath ratio is typically 30 compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths if trained to do so.\n\n6. **Use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED)**: As soon as an AED is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. Apply the pads to the bare chest of the victim and ensure no one is touching the person while the AED analyzes the heart rhythm. If a shock is advised, deliver it as instructed.\n\nThese steps are part of the "Chain of Survival," which emphasizes the importance of early recognition of cardiac arrest, calling for help, starting CPR, and using a defibrillator to increase the chances of survival. Regular training and practice of these skills are essential for effective response in emergency situations.
