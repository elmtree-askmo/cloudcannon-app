    Describe the phases of an action potential and the changes in membrane potential during each phase.
answer: >-
    The phases of an action potential are critical for understanding how neurons communicate and transmit signals. Here’s a detailed description of each phase and the corresponding changes in membrane potential:\n\n1. **Resting Phase**: \n   - The neuron is at its resting membrane potential, typically around -70 mV. During this phase, the sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions (Na⁺) out of the cell and potassium ions (K⁺) into the cell, maintaining the negative charge inside the neuron relative to the outside.\n\n2. **Depolarization**: \n   - When a stimulus reaches the neuron, it causes voltage-gated sodium channels to open. This results in a rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell, leading to a significant increase in membrane potential. The membrane potential rises from -70 mV towards a threshold of approximately -55 mV. Once this threshold is reached, a full action potential is triggered, and the membrane potential can peak at around +30 mV.\n\n3. **Repolarization**: \n   - After reaching the peak of the action potential, the sodium channels close, and voltage-gated potassium channels open. Potassium ions exit the cell, causing the membrane potential to decrease rapidly. This phase restores the negative charge inside the neuron, moving the membrane potential back towards the resting level.\n\n4. **Hyperpolarization**: \n   - The efflux of potassium ions can overshoot the resting membrane potential, resulting in a temporary hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, which can drop to around -80 mV. This phase is important as it makes the neuron less likely to fire another action potential immediately, contributing to the refractory period.\n\n5. **Return to Resting Potential**: \n   - Eventually, the membrane potential stabilizes back to the resting level of -70 mV as the potassium channels close and the sodium-potassium pump continues to maintain the ion gradients.\n\nThese phases are crucial for the all-or-nothing response of action potentials, allowing for effective signal transmission along neurons. The rapid changes in membrane potential during these phases are essential for neuronal communication and the functioning of the nervous system.
