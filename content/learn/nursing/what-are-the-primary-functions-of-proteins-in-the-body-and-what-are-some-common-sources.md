    What are the primary functions of proteins in the body, and what are some common sources?
answer: >-
    Proteins are essential macronutrients that play several critical roles in the body. Here are the primary functions of proteins:\n\n1. **Building and Repairing Tissues**: Proteins are the building blocks of muscles, skin, organs, and other tissues. They are crucial for growth and repair, especially after injury or during periods of growth, such as childhood and adolescence.\n\n2. **Enzymatic Functions**: Many proteins function as enzymes, which catalyze biochemical reactions in the body. These reactions are vital for digestion, metabolism, and other physiological processes.\n\n3. **Hormonal Regulation**: Some proteins act as hormones, which are chemical messengers that help regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, and mood. Examples include insulin and glucagon.\n\n4. **Immune Function**: Proteins are essential for the immune system. Antibodies, which are proteins, help identify and neutralize pathogens like bacteria and viruses.\n\n5. **Transport and Storage**: Proteins transport molecules throughout the body. For instance, hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in the blood, while other proteins store nutrients, such as ferritin, which stores iron.\n\n6. **Energy Source**: Although carbohydrates and fats are the primary energy sources, proteins can also be used for energy when necessary, particularly during prolonged exercise or fasting.\n\n7. **Maintaining pH and Fluid Balance**: Proteins help maintain the acid-base balance in the body and contribute to fluid balance by attracting and holding water in the bloodstream.\n\n### Common Sources of Protein\n\nProteins can be obtained from both animal and plant sources. Here are some common sources:\n\n- **Animal Sources**:\n  - Meat (beef, pork, lamb)\n  - Poultry (chicken, turkey)\n  - Fish and seafood\n  - Eggs\n  - Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt)\n\n- **Plant Sources**:\n  - Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)\n  - Nuts and seeds (almonds, peanuts, chia seeds)\n  - Whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, oats)\n  - Soy products (tofu, tempeh)\n\nA balanced diet should include a variety of these protein sources to ensure adequate intake of essential amino acids and other nutrients. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein varies by age, sex, and activity level, but generally, adults should aim for about 46-56 grams of protein per day.
