    Identify two external causes of brain injury and explain their potential impact.
answer: >-
    Two external causes of brain injury include:\n\n1. **Falls**: Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), particularly among older adults and young children. When an individual falls, the impact can cause the brain to collide with the inside of the skull, leading to bruising, bleeding, or other forms of damage. The potential impact of falls on brain health can be severe, resulting in cognitive impairments, memory issues, and changes in emotional regulation. In older adults, falls can also lead to complications such as fractures, which may further complicate recovery and rehabilitation processes.\n\n2. **Vehicle Accidents**: Motor vehicle accidents are another significant external cause of TBIs. The force of a collision can result in direct trauma to the head or cause the brain to move violently within the skull, leading to concussions or more severe brain injuries. The impact of vehicle accidents can vary widely, from mild concussions to severe injuries that may result in long-term cognitive deficits, emotional disturbances, and challenges in daily functioning. Recovery from such injuries often requires extensive rehabilitation and can have lasting effects on an individual's quality of life.\n\nBoth of these external causes highlight the importance of preventive measures, such as safety protocols and awareness campaigns, to reduce the incidence of brain injuries in vulnerable populations.
