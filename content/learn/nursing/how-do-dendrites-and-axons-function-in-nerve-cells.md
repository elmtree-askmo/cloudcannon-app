    How do dendrites and axons function in nerve cells?
answer: >-
    Dendrites and axons are critical components of nerve cells (neurons) that play distinct but complementary roles in the transmission of nerve impulses.\n\n1. **Dendrites**: These are tree-like structures that extend from the neuronâ€™s cell body. Their primary function is to receive signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. Dendrites contain numerous synapses, which are the points of communication between neurons. When a signal (in the form of a neurotransmitter) binds to receptors on the dendrites, it generates a small electrical change (graded potential) that can influence the overall activity of the neuron. If the cumulative signals received by the dendrites are strong enough, they can trigger an action potential.\n\n2. **Axons**: The axon is a long, slender projection that transmits electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Once an action potential is generated at the axon hillock (the junction between the cell body and the axon), it travels down the axon. Axons can be quite long, and many are covered with a myelin sheath, which is an insulating layer that speeds up the transmission of the electrical signal. At the end of the axon, the signal reaches the axon terminals, where neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft to communicate with the next neuron or target cell.\n\nIn summary, dendrites are responsible for receiving incoming signals, while axons are responsible for sending signals out to other cells. This coordinated function is essential for the nervous system to process information and respond to stimuli effectively.
