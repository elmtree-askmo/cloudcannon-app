    What is the process for becoming a foster parent through CAST?
answer: >-
    To become a foster parent through the Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST), you will need to follow a structured process that includes several key steps:\n\n1. **Initial Inquiry**: The first step is to complete the online inquiry form available on the CAST website. This form allows you to express your interest in becoming a foster parent.\n\n2. **Information Session**: It is recommended to attend a free information session, often held in collaboration with organizations like The 519. These sessions provide valuable insights into the fostering system, address common myths, and help you understand the responsibilities involved.\n\n3. **Application Process**: After the information session, you will need to fill out an application to become a foster parent. This includes:\n   - Completing necessary paperwork.\n   - Providing references.\n   - Consenting to background checks, including a Police Check with a Vulnerable Sector Search for all household members over the age of 18.\n\n4. **Home Study**: A critical component of the approval process is the Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE), which involves home visits by a CAST worker. This comprehensive assessment evaluates your eligibility, suitability, and readiness to foster children.\n\n5. **Training**: All prospective foster parents must undergo training to prepare for the responsibilities of fostering. This training covers various aspects of child care and the fostering system.\n\n6. **Approval**: Once you have completed the application, home study, and training, your application will be reviewed. If approved, you will be officially recognized as a foster parent.\n\n7. **Ongoing Support**: After becoming a foster parent, CAST provides ongoing support and resources to help you in your role.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance during the process, you can contact CAST directly at:\n- Email: jpoon@torontocas.ca or danderson@torontocas.ca\n- Phone: 416-924-4646 (extensions 3545 and 3517) or the Recruitment Line at 416-395-1720.\n\nThis process is designed to ensure the safety and well-being of children placed in foster care, and it may take time to complete all the steps involved.
