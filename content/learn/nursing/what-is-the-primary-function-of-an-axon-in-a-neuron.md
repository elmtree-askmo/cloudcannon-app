    What is the primary function of an axon in a neuron?
answer: >-
    The primary function of an axon in a neuron is to transmit electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. This transmission is crucial for effective communication within the nervous system. \n\nAxons are typically long and slender, allowing them to reach distant targets. Many axons are covered by a myelin sheath, which is a fatty layer that insulates the axon. This myelination increases the speed of signal transmission through a process known as saltatory conduction, where the electrical impulses jump between the nodes of Ranvier (gaps in the myelin sheath), significantly enhancing the efficiency of neural communication.\n\nIn summary, the axon plays a vital role in the nervous system by facilitating the rapid transmission of electrical signals, which is essential for coordinating responses and processing information throughout the body.
