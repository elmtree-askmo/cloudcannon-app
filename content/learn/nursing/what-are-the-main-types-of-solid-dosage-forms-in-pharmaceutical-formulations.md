    What are the main types of solid dosage forms in pharmaceutical formulations?
answer: >-
    The main types of solid dosage forms in pharmaceutical formulations include:\n\n1. **Tablets**: These are compressed solid dosage forms that contain active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) along with excipients. Tablets can be further classified into various types, such as:\n   - **Immediate Release Tablets**: Designed to release the drug quickly upon administration.\n   - **Extended Release Tablets**: Formulated to release the drug slowly over an extended period.\n   - **Chewable Tablets**: Intended to be chewed before swallowing.\n   - **Effervescent Tablets**: Dissolve in water to release carbon dioxide, creating an effervescent solution.\n   - **Sublingual and Buccal Tablets**: Placed under the tongue or in the cheek pouch for rapid absorption.\n\n2. **Capsules**: These consist of a gelatin shell that encloses the drug. Capsules can be hard or soft and are available in various sizes. They are often used for powders or granules and can be designed for immediate or delayed release.\n\n3. **Powders**: These are solid dosage forms that consist of finely divided particles. Powders can be used for direct administration or can be formulated into other dosage forms like capsules or tablets.\n\n4. **Granules**: These are aggregates of powder particles that are larger than powders but smaller than tablets. Granules can be used in the preparation of tablets or can be taken directly.\n\n5. **Sachets**: These are small packets that contain a single dose of medication in powder form, which can be dissolved in water before administration.\n\n6. **Pills**: These are small, round solid dosage forms that contain a mixture of drugs and excipients, typically made by rolling or molding.\n\nEach of these solid dosage forms has its own advantages and disadvantages, influencing their selection based on patient needs, drug properties, and therapeutic goals. Solid dosage forms are favored for their stability, ease of administration, and precise dosing capabilities.
