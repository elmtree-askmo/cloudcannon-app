    What are the causes and symptoms of viral meningitis, and how is it treated?
answer: >-
    Viral meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord, primarily caused by viral infections. The most common viruses associated with viral meningitis include enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus (particularly HSV-2), and mumps virus.\n\n### Causes of Viral Meningitis:\n1. **Enteroviruses**: These are the most common cause, especially in children. They can be spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or fecal matter.\n2. **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**: Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause viral meningitis, with HSV-2 being more commonly associated with genital infections.\n3. **Mumps Virus**: This virus can lead to viral meningitis, particularly in unvaccinated individuals.\n4. **Other Viruses**: Other viruses such as West Nile virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus can also cause viral meningitis.\n\n### Symptoms of Viral Meningitis:\nThe symptoms of viral meningitis can vary but typically include:\n- **Fever**: Often mild to moderate.\n- **Headache**: A common and often severe symptom.\n- **Stiff Neck**: Difficulty in bending the neck forward.\n- **Sensitivity to Light**: Photophobia is common.\n- **Nausea and Vomiting**: May occur alongside other symptoms.\n- **Fatigue**: General feeling of tiredness or malaise.\n- **Rash**: In some cases, a rash may develop, particularly with certain viral infections.\n\n### Diagnosis:\nDiagnosis of viral meningitis is typically confirmed through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In cases of viral meningitis, the CSF may appear clear or slightly cloudy, and it will show an increase in lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) without the presence of bacteria.\n\n### Treatment:\nViral meningitis is generally less severe than bacterial meningitis and often resolves on its own without specific treatment. However, supportive care is important and may include:\n- **Rest**: Allowing the body to recover.\n- **Hydration**: Ensuring adequate fluid intake.\n- **Pain Relief**: Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate headache and fever.\n- **Antiviral Medications**: In cases caused by herpes simplex virus, antiviral medications like acyclovir may be administered.\n\nCorticosteroids may also be used to reduce inflammation in some cases, although their use is more common in bacterial meningitis.\n\nIn summary, while viral meningitis can cause significant discomfort and symptoms, it is usually less severe than bacterial meningitis and often resolves with supportive care.
