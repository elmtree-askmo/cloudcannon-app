    What is the role of vitamins in body functions, and what are some common sources?
answer: >-
    Vitamins play a crucial role in various metabolic processes within the body. They are organic compounds that are essential for maintaining health and supporting numerous bodily functions. Vitamins are classified into two main categories: \n\n1. **Water-soluble vitamins**: These include vitamin C and the B vitamins (such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12). They are not stored in the body and need to be consumed regularly. Their functions include:\n   - **Vitamin C**: Important for immune function, collagen synthesis, and antioxidant protection.\n   - **B Vitamins**: Involved in energy metabolism, red blood cell formation, and neurological functions.\n\n2. **Fat-soluble vitamins**: These include vitamins A, D, E, and K. They can be stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver. Their functions include:\n   - **Vitamin A**: Essential for vision, immune function, and skin health.\n   - **Vitamin D**: Important for calcium absorption and bone health.\n   - **Vitamin E**: Acts as an antioxidant and supports immune function.\n   - **Vitamin K**: Crucial for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n\nCommon sources of vitamins include:\n- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Rich in vitamins, especially vitamin C and various B vitamins. For example, citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, while leafy greens provide vitamin K.\n- **Whole Grains**: Good sources of B vitamins.\n- **Protein Foods**: Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts provide various vitamins, including B12 (found primarily in animal products) and vitamin D (found in fatty fish).\n- **Dairy Products**: Excellent sources of vitamin B12 and vitamin D.\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Provide vitamin E and various B vitamins.\n\nA balanced diet that includes a variety of these food sources typically provides sufficient vitamins. However, deficiencies can lead to health problems, making it important to consume adequate amounts of these essential nutrients.
