    What are the basic units of weight in the metric system?
answer: >-
    The basic units of weight in the metric system include:\n\n1. **Kilogram (kg)**: The base unit of mass in the metric system, equal to 1,000 grams. It is commonly used for measuring body weight and larger quantities of mass.\n\n2. **Gram (g)**: A unit of mass that is equal to one-thousandth of a kilogram. It is frequently used in medicine for measuring medication dosages.\n\n3. **Milligram (mg)**: A unit of mass equal to one-thousandth of a gram. This unit is often used for smaller doses of medication.\n\n4. **Microgram (mcg)**: A unit of mass equal to one-millionth of a gram. It is used for very small doses of medication, particularly in cases where precision is critical.\n\n5. **Nanogram (ng)**: A unit of mass equal to one-billionth of a gram. This unit is used in specialized medical contexts, such as measuring certain hormones or drugs in the bloodstream.\n\nThese units are part of a decimal-based system that simplifies conversions, as each unit is a power of ten relative to the others. For example, 1 kilogram equals 1,000 grams, 1 gram equals 1,000 milligrams, and so forth. This structure is particularly important in healthcare for ensuring accurate medication dosing and administration.
