answer: >-
    Here are some common review questions on vascular anatomy that can help reinforce understanding:\n\n1. Which statement does not accurately describe veins?\n   - (a) have less elastic tissue and smooth muscle than arteries\n   - (b) most veins in the extremities have valves\n   - (c) always carry deoxygenated blood\n\n2. The coronary arteries branch off of the __________?\n   - Answer: aorta\n\n3. The Brachiocephalic trunk will bifurcate into __________ and __________?\n   - Answer: right common carotid artery and right subclavian artery\n\n4. The celiac trunk branches into which arteries?\n   - Answer: left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries\n\n5. What are the internal vessels that nourish arteries and veins called?\n   - Answer: Vasa vasorum (vessels of vessels)\n\n6. Where does the Common Femoral Vein pass beneath in the lower extremity veins?\n   - Answer: beneath the inguinal ligament\n\n7. What is the smallest and most numerous type of blood vessels in the body?\n   - Answer: Capillaries\n\n8. What is the primary function of capillaries?\n   - Answer: To facilitate the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues.\n\n9. What is the significance of valves in veins?\n   - Answer: Valves prevent the backflow of blood and help maintain unidirectional flow towards the heart.\n\n10. What are the major branches of the aortic arch?\n    - Answer: Brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery.\n\nThese questions cover various aspects of vascular anatomy, including the structure and function of blood vessels, major arteries and veins, and the physiological roles they play in the circulatory system.
