    Define dehiscence and evisceration and explain the difference between them.
answer: >-
    Dehiscence and evisceration are both complications that can occur following surgical procedures, particularly in high-risk patients.\n\n**Dehiscence** refers to the partial or total separation of the layers of a surgical wound. This can happen when the wound has not healed properly, often due to factors such as excessive strain (e.g., coughing, sneezing, or heavy lifting), infection, or inadequate surgical technique. In cases of dehiscence, the wound may appear to bulge or open, but the internal organs remain contained within the body.\n\n**Evisceration**, on the other hand, is a more severe condition where internal organs protrude through the wound. This typically occurs when the wound has completely opened, allowing organs, such as intestines, to spill out. Evisceration is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate attention.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Dehiscence**: Partial or total separation of wound layers; internal organs remain inside the body.\n- **Evisceration**: Protrusion of internal organs through the wound; a more critical condition requiring urgent care.\n\nIn both cases, immediate care is essential. For dehiscence, the wound should be covered with a sterile dressing, and a healthcare provider should be contacted. In the case of evisceration, the protruding organs should be covered with a moist sterile dressing, and emergency medical assistance should be sought immediately.
