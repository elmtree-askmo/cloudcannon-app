    What are the main stages of sleep, and how do they differ in terms of brain activity and physiological changes?

    Sleep is divided into several stages, primarily categorized into non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. Each stage is characterized by distinct brain activity patterns and physiological changes, serving different functions essential for overall health.\n\n### Stages of Sleep\n\n1. **NREM Sleep**:\n   - **Stage 1 (Light Sleep)**: This is the transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. It lasts for a few minutes and is characterized by slow eye movements and reduced muscle activity. Brain waves begin to slow down from their daytime wakefulness patterns.\n   - **Stage 2 (Moderate Sleep)**: This stage constitutes about 50% of total sleep time. It features further slowing of brain waves, with occasional bursts of rapid waves known as sleep spindles. Heart rate and body temperature decrease, and eye movements stop.\n   - **Stage 3 (Deep Sleep)**: Also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), this stage is crucial for physical restoration. It is characterized by delta waves, which are slow brain waves. During this stage, the body repairs tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens the immune system. It is difficult to awaken someone in this stage.\n\n2. **REM Sleep (Rapid Eye Movement Sleep)**:\n   - REM sleep typically occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep and recurs multiple times throughout the night, with each episode lengthening as the night progresses. It is characterized by rapid eye movements, increased brain activity, and vivid dreaming. During REM sleep, the brain is active, but the body experiences temporary muscle paralysis, preventing the individual from acting out dreams. This stage is essential for cognitive functions such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and learning.\n\n### Differences in Brain Activity and Physiological Changes\n\n- **Brain Activity**: \n  - In NREM sleep, particularly in Stage 3, brain activity is significantly reduced, with slow delta waves dominating. In contrast, REM sleep shows brain activity levels similar to those when awake, with increased activity in areas associated with learning and memory.\n  \n- **Physiological Changes**:\n  - During NREM sleep, physiological functions such as heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure decrease, promoting physical restoration. In REM sleep, heart rate and breathing can become irregular, and there is increased blood flow to the brain, which supports cognitive processes.\n\n### Summary\n\nEach stage of sleep plays a vital role in maintaining physical and mental health. NREM sleep is primarily restorative, while REM sleep is crucial for cognitive functions. Understanding these stages helps in recognizing the importance of sleep hygiene and addressing common sleep disorders effectively.
