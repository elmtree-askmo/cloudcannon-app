    What are the differences between Stage 1 and Stage 2 pressure injuries?
answer: >-
    Stage 1 and Stage 2 pressure injuries are classified based on the extent of skin damage and the characteristics of the affected area. Here are the key differences between the two stages:\n\n### Stage 1 Pressure Injury:\n- **Skin Integrity**: The skin remains intact.\n- **Color Changes**: There is non-blanchable erythema (redness) of the skin. When pressed, the area does not turn white.\n- **Temperature**: The affected area may feel warmer or cooler compared to surrounding skin.\n- **Sensation**: The area may be painful or tender.\n- **Swelling**: There may be some swelling present.\n- **Appearance**: The skin may appear red, blue, or purple, especially in individuals with darker skin tones. It is important to assess changes in temperature, edema, and sensation, as blanching may be difficult to determine.\n\n### Stage 2 Pressure Injury:\n- **Skin Integrity**: There is partial-thickness loss of skin, which means the skin has broken open or worn away.\n- **Wound Bed**: The wound presents as a shallow open ulcer with a red or pink wound bed. It may also appear as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister.\n- **Depth**: The injury extends through the epidermis and into the dermis, but does not involve deeper tissues such as fat or muscle.\n- **Exudate**: The wound may produce some exudate, and it is typically moist.\n- **Characteristics**: Adipose (fat) tissue, granulation tissue, slough, and eschar are not visible in this stage.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, Stage 1 pressure injuries are characterized by intact skin with non-blanchable redness, while Stage 2 injuries involve partial-thickness skin loss with an open wound and exposed dermis. Proper assessment and treatment are crucial at both stages to prevent progression to more severe injuries.
