    How does the puffing reflex manifest in infants?
answer: >-
    The puffing reflex, also known as the "sucking reflex," is one of the primitive reflexes observed in infants. This reflex manifests when the corner of the baby's mouth is stroked or touched, prompting the baby to instinctively suck. It is a crucial reflex that develops even before birth and plays a significant role in the infant's ability to feed, whether through breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.\n\nInitially, the sucking reflex is an involuntary action, but as the infant grows, it becomes more voluntary and controlled. By around 2 months of age, infants typically begin to gain more control over this reflex, and by 3 to 4 months, the reflex may start to diminish as the child develops more voluntary motor skills. The presence and strength of the sucking reflex are important indicators of the infant's neurological development and overall health.\n\nIn summary, the puffing reflex is a vital component of an infant's early development, facilitating feeding and contributing to the establishment of secure attachment with caregivers.
