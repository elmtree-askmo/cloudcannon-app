    What are the indications and contraindications for anatomical shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    Anatomical shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is primarily indicated for patients suffering from advanced glenohumeral arthritis, particularly when conservative treatments have failed. The specific indications for anatomical TSA include:\n\n1. **End-stage Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis**: Patients with severe pain and dysfunction due to osteoarthritis that is unresponsive to nonoperative treatments such as activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections.\n2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who experience significant shoulder pain and loss of function.\n3. **Osteonecrosis**: Individuals with avascular necrosis of the humeral head that leads to joint pain and dysfunction.\n4. **Instability Arthropathy**: Patients with shoulder instability that has not responded to non-surgical interventions.\n5. **Post-infectious or Post-traumatic Arthritis**: Cases where arthritis has developed following an infection or trauma that has not been adequately managed through conservative means.\n\nIn contrast, the contraindications for anatomical shoulder arthroplasty include:\n\n1. **Active Infection**: Any ongoing infection in the shoulder joint or surrounding tissues.\n2. **Charcot's Arthropathy**: A condition characterized by joint degeneration due to nerve damage, which complicates surgical outcomes.\n3. **Severe Neurological Pathologies**: Conditions that significantly impair the function of the shoulder muscles or nerves, making surgery less likely to succeed.\n4. **Insufficient Glenoid Bone Stock**: Inadequate bone quality or quantity to support stable glenoid component implantation.\n5. **Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears**: In cases where the rotator cuff is severely damaged and cannot be repaired, reverse shoulder arthroplasty may be a more suitable option.\n\nUnderstanding these indications and contraindications is crucial for determining the appropriate surgical approach and ensuring optimal outcomes for patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty.
