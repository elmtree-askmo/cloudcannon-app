    Under the duty of care, employees have specific responsibilities when it comes to reporting faulty equipment. These duties are crucial for maintaining a safe working environment and ensuring the well-being of both staff and patients. Here are the key employee duties in this context:\n\n1. **Report Hazards**: Employees are required to report any identified hazards, including faulty equipment, to their supervisors or designated safety personnel. This proactive approach helps in addressing potential risks before they lead to accidents or injuries.\n\n2. **Follow Safety Procedures**: Employees must adhere to established safety protocols regarding the use and maintenance of equipment. This includes using equipment only as intended and following operational guidelines to prevent misuse that could lead to malfunctions.\n\n3. **Participate in Training**: Employees should engage in training programs related to equipment safety and maintenance. This ensures they are knowledgeable about the proper use of equipment and aware of the procedures for reporting faults.\n\n4. **Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: When working with or around potentially faulty equipment, employees should utilize any provided PPE to minimize risk to their health and safety.\n\n5. **Cooperate with Safety Initiatives**: Employees should actively participate in safety initiatives and policies implemented by their employers, which may include regular equipment checks and maintenance schedules.\n\n6. **Right to Refuse Unsafe Work**: Employees have the right to refuse to use equipment they believe is unsafe or faulty. This right is protected under health and safety regulations, allowing employees to prioritize their safety without fear of retaliation.\n\n7. **Document Incidents**: If an incident occurs due to faulty equipment, employees should document the event accurately and report it according to the organization's incident reporting procedures. This documentation is essential for investigating the cause and preventing future occurrences.\n\nBy fulfilling these duties, employees contribute to a culture of safety within the workplace, which is essential for preventing workplace injuries and ensuring the well-being of all individuals involved in care settings.
