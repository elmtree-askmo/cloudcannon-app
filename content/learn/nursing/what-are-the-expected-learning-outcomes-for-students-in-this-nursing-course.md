This includes understanding and applying patient care technologies and information systems that support safe nursing practice.\n\n2. **Evidence-Based Practice**: Graduates will be able to integrate evidence-based practice into patient-centered care, utilizing the nursing process across various settings and populations. This involves synthesizing knowledge from nursing, previous learning, and life experiences.\n\n3. **Holistic Care**: Students will develop competencies necessary to meet the needs of individuals throughout the lifespan in a safe, legal, and ethical manner. This includes applying the nursing process to maintain health and manage common health alterations.\n\n4. **Communication and Relationship Building**: Students will demonstrate the ability to establish and maintain effective nurse-client and family relationships, which is crucial for providing coordinated and person-centered care.\n\n5. **Teaching and Learning Principles**: Nursing students will incorporate principles of teaching and learning within their scope of practice to promote health and prevent illness.\n\n6. **Cultural Competence and Social Determinants of Health**: Students will be prepared to understand and address social determinants of health, ensuring they can work effectively with diverse populations and engage in community health initiatives.\n\n7. **Professionalism and Ethical Practice**: Graduates will be expected to uphold ethical and legal obligations in nursing practice, demonstrating professionalism in all interactions and decision-making processes.\n\n8. **Clinical Competency**: At the conclusion of the course, students should demonstrate competency in performing basic nursing skills and applying the nursing process effectively in clinical settings.\n\nThese outcomes are designed to ensure that nursing graduates are well-prepared to meet the challenges of the profession and provide high-quality care to their patients. The integration of these competencies into the curriculum is essential for fostering the development of skilled and knowledgeable nursing professionals.
