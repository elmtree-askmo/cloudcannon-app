    What is horizontal violence and how does it differ from other forms of workplace violence?
answer: >-
    Horizontal violence (HV), also known as lateral violence or workplace bullying, refers to hostile, aggressive, and harmful behaviors exhibited by one employee towards another who is in an equal or lesser position within the workplace. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in the nursing profession, where it manifests as incivility or bullying among peers. \n\nThe key characteristics of horizontal violence include:\n\n1. **Nature of Behavior**: HV encompasses both overt and covert acts of aggression, which can include verbal abuse, intimidation, humiliation, and other disruptive behaviors. These actions can significantly contribute to an unsafe work environment and negatively impact patient outcomes.\n\n2. **Power Dynamics**: Unlike other forms of workplace violence, which may involve a clear power imbalance (such as supervisor-to-subordinate aggression), horizontal violence occurs between individuals of similar hierarchical status. This can create a unique dynamic where the aggressor and the victim are often colleagues, leading to a complex interplay of relationships and workplace culture.\n\n3. **Impact on Workplace Culture**: Horizontal violence can lead to a toxic workplace culture, characterized by fear, mistrust, and decreased morale among staff. It can also result in high turnover rates, increased illness, and decreased productivity, which are detrimental not only to the employees but also to the organization as a whole.\n\n4. **Comparison with Other Forms of Workplace Violence**: Other forms of workplace violence may include physical assaults or harassment from individuals in positions of authority or external threats. In contrast, horizontal violence is primarily internal, occurring among peers, and is often less recognized or addressed in workplace policies.\n\nIn summary, horizontal violence is a significant issue in many workplaces, particularly in healthcare settings, where it can undermine teamwork and collaboration. Addressing this form of violence requires a concerted effort to foster a positive workplace culture, implement effective policies, and provide support for those affected.
