    What are the main types of seizures associated with epilepsy?
answer: >-
    Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures resulting from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The main types of seizures associated with epilepsy can be categorized based on their onset and characteristics. Here are the primary types:\n\n1. **Focal Onset Seizures**: \n   - These seizures originate in one hemisphere of the brain and affect approximately 60% of individuals with epilepsy. They can be further divided into:\n     - **Focal Aware Seizures**: The person remains aware and conscious during the seizure.\n     - **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures**: The person's awareness is impaired, and they may not respond to their environment.\n\n2. **Generalized Onset Seizures**: \n   - These seizures involve both hemispheres of the brain from the onset and typically result in loss of consciousness. They can be further classified into several subtypes, including:\n     - **Tonic-Clonic Seizures (Grand Mal)**: Characterized by muscle stiffening (tonic phase) followed by rhythmic jerking (clonic phase).\n     - **Absence Seizures (Petit Mal)**: Brief episodes of staring or loss of awareness, often without any physical convulsions.\n     - **Myoclonic Seizures**: Sudden, brief jerks or twitches of the muscles.\n     - **Atonic Seizures**: Sudden loss of muscle tone, which can lead to falls.\n\n3. **Focal and Generalized Combined Seizures**: \n   - These seizures exhibit characteristics of both focal and generalized seizures, starting in one area of the brain and then spreading to involve both hemispheres.\n\n4. **Unknown Onset Seizures**: \n   - When the onset of the seizure is not clear, it is classified as unknown. This category is used when the information about the seizure is insufficient to determine its type.\n\nCommon triggers for seizures can include stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, and certain medications or substances. Management of epilepsy often involves medication, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgical interventions.\n\nUnderstanding the different types of seizures is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, as each type may require a different therapeutic approach.
