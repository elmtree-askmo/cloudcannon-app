    Describe the structure and function of the dura mater.
answer: >-
    The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges, which are the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Its structure and function are critical for the protection and support of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n### Structure of the Dura Mater\n- **Composition**: The dura mater is composed of dense, fibrous connective tissue, making it tough and resilient. This fibrous nature provides a strong barrier against physical impacts and infections.\n- **Layers**: In the cranial cavity, the dura mater consists of two layers:\n  1. **Periosteal layer**: This layer is attached to the inner surface of the skull and serves as a protective covering.\n  2. **Meningeal layer**: This layer is deeper and continues down the spinal cord. It is responsible for forming dural folds (such as the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli) that help compartmentalize the brain.\n- **Spinal Dura Mater**: In the spinal region, the dura mater is a single layer that does not adhere directly to the vertebrae, allowing for the presence of an epidural space filled with fat and blood vessels.\n\n### Function of the Dura Mater\n- **Protection**: The dura mater provides a robust protective layer for the brain and spinal cord, shielding them from mechanical injury and infection.\n- **Support**: It helps maintain the structural integrity of the CNS by anchoring the brain within the skull and the spinal cord within the vertebral column.\n- **Containment of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)**: While the dura mater itself does not contain CSF, it plays a role in the overall meninges system that houses CSF in the subarachnoid space, which cushions the brain and spinal cord.\n- **Formation of Sinuses**: The dura mater contains venous sinuses that drain blood from the brain, facilitating venous return and maintaining intracranial pressure.\n\nIn summary, the dura mater is a vital component of the meninges, providing essential protective and supportive functions for the central nervous system. Its tough, fibrous structure and layered organization are crucial for safeguarding the brain and spinal cord from injury and infection.
