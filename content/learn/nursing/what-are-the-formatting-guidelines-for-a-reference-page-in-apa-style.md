    What are the formatting guidelines for a reference page in APA style?
answer: >-
    In APA style, the formatting guidelines for a reference page are as follows:\n\n1. **New Page**: The reference list should begin on a new page, separate from the text of the essay.\n\n2. **Title**: Label this page "References" in bold, centered at the top of the page. Do not underline or use quotation marks for the title.\n\n3. **Margins and Spacing**: Use 1-inch margins on all sides and double-space all entries in the reference list.\n\n4. **Alphabetical Order**: References should be sorted alphabetically by the last name of the first author. If the author is unknown, order the reference entry by the first meaningful word of the title, ignoring articles like "the," "a," or "an."\n\n5. **Hanging Indent**: Each reference entry should have a hanging indent, meaning the first line of each entry is flush left, and subsequent lines are indented by 0.5 inches.\n\n6. **Consistency**: Ensure that all works cited in the text are included in the reference list, and vice versa. If a work is not cited in the text, either add information from the work and cite it or delete the reference from the list.\n\n7. **Formatting Examples**: The specific format of each reference will depend on the type of source (e.g., books, journal articles, websites). For detailed examples, refer to the APA Publication Manual, particularly sections 2.12 and 9.43 to 9.49.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your reference page meets the standards set by the APA style. For more detailed information, you may consult the APA Publication Manual or resources like the Purdue OWL.
