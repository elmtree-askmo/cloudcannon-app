    How is an AED used during a cardiac emergency?

    Using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) during a cardiac emergency is a critical step that can significantly increase the chances of survival for someone experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to effectively use an AED:\n\n1. **Check for Responsiveness**: Gently tap the person and shout to see if they respond. If there is no response, call 911 or have someone else do so immediately.\n\n2. **Start Chest Compressions**: Begin CPR with chest compressions. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.\n\n3. **Locate the AED**: As soon as possible, find an AED. If you are not alone, have someone else retrieve it while you continue CPR.\n\n4. **Prepare the Victim**: Ensure the victim is lying on their back on a firm surface. Remove any clothing covering the chest to expose the skin.\n\n5. **Apply AED Pads**: Open the AED and take out the pads. Place one pad on the upper right chest above the collarbone and the other pad on the lower left side of the chest, below the nipple.\n\n6. **Connect AED Pads to the Device**: Follow the instructions on the AED to connect the pads to the device. Most AEDs will have clear visual and audio prompts.\n\n7. **Clear the Area**: Ensure that no one is touching the victim and that the area around them is clear. The AED will analyze the heart rhythm and may prompt you to deliver a shock.\n\n8. **Shock if Necessary**: If the AED advises a shock, ensure everyone is clear of the victim and press the shock button. After delivering the shock, immediately resume CPR, starting with chest compressions.\n\n9. **Continue Following AED Instructions**: The AED will provide further instructions. Continue CPR until emergency medical services arrive or the person shows signs of life.\n\nIt is important to remember that survival rates drop significantly for every minute that passes without defibrillation. Using an AED within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest can increase a person's chance of survival by up to 49-75%. Therefore, knowing how to use an AED can make you a crucial first responder in emergencies. \n\nAdditionally, AEDs are designed to be user-friendly, with voice prompts guiding you through the process, making it easier for lay rescuers to assist in a cardiac emergency.
