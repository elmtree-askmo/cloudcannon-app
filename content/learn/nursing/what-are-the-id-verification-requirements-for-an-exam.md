    What are the ID verification requirements for an exam?
answer: >-
    The ID verification requirements for the exam stipulate that students must present valid identification to enter the exam venue and participate in the examination. Acceptable forms of identification typically include a student ID card or any other official document that verifies the student's identity. This requirement is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the examination process and preventing proxy test-taking, ensuring that each student taking the exam is indeed the registered individual. \n\nIn summary, students should ensure they have their identification ready before arriving at the exam location to avoid any issues with entry.
