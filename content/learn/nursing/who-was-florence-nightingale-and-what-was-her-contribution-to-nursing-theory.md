answer: >-
    Florence Nightingale (12 May 1820 - 13 August 1910) is widely regarded as the founder of modern nursing and is often referred to as the "Mother of Nursing." Her contributions to nursing theory and practice have had a profound and lasting impact on the field.\n\n### Contributions to Nursing Theory\n\n1. **Environmental Theory**: Nightingale is best known for her Environmental Theory, which emphasizes the importance of the patient's environment in the healing process. She believed that a clean, well-ventilated, and quiet environment could significantly improve patient outcomes. This theory laid the groundwork for the practice of infection control and the design of healthcare facilities to promote healing.\n\n2. **Holistic Approach**: Nightingale advocated for a holistic approach to nursing, which involves caring for the patient's body, mind, and spirit. She emphasized that nurses should use their intellect, compassion, and practical skills to create healing environments. This philosophy has influenced contemporary nursing practices that prioritize patient-centered care.\n\n3. **Notes on Nursing**: In 1859, Nightingale published "Notes on Nursing: What It Is, and What It Is Not," a seminal work that provided guidelines for nursing practice. The book was intended to educate nurses and the public about the principles of nursing care, focusing on the importance of sanitation, nutrition, and the psychological aspects of patient care.\n\n4. **Healthcare Reform**: Nightingale's work during the Crimean War, where she improved the conditions of military hospitals, highlighted the need for healthcare reform. Her efforts led to significant changes in hospital design and nursing education, establishing standards that are still relevant today.\n\n5. **Nursing Education**: Nightingale founded the Nightingale Training School for Nurses at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, which was the first secular nursing school in the world. This institution set the standard for nursing education and professional training, emphasizing the need for formal education in nursing.\n\n### Legacy\n\nFlorence Nightingale's legacy continues to influence nursing theory and practice. Her emphasis on the environment, holistic care, and the importance of education has shaped modern nursing into a respected profession. Nightingale's principles are still applied in various nursing theories and practices today, making her a pivotal figure in the evolution of nursing as a science and an art. Her contributions have not only improved patient care but have also established nursing as a vital component of the healthcare system.
