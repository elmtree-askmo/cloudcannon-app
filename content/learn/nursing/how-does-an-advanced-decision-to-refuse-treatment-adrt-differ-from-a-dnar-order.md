answer: >-
    An Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT) and a Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) order are both important legal documents related to patient care, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.\n\n1. **Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT)**:\n   - An ADRT is a legally binding document that allows individuals to refuse specific medical treatments in the future when they may lack the capacity to make decisions. \n   - It must be signed while the individual has the capacity to make informed decisions and can specify conditions under which certain treatments, such as CPR, should not be administered.\n   - The ADRT can cover a range of treatments, not just CPR, and is applicable in various medical situations where the patient may not be able to express their wishes.\n\n2. **Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR)**:\n   - A DNAR order is a specific medical directive indicating that in the event of a cardiac arrest, resuscitation efforts such as CPR should not be initiated.\n   - This decision can be made by the patient or their healthcare provider based on the patient's medical condition and prognosis.\n   - Importantly, a DNAR order only applies to CPR; other treatments, such as medications or interventions for infections, will still be provided.\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- **Scope**: ADRT can refuse multiple treatments, while DNAR specifically addresses CPR.\n- **Initiation**: ADRT is created in advance by the patient when they have decision-making capacity, whereas a DNAR can be established by healthcare providers based on the patient's condition.\n- **Legality**: Both are legally binding, but the ADRT is broader in its application compared to the DNAR, which is limited to resuscitation efforts.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for healthcare providers to respect patient autonomy and ensure appropriate care in accordance with the patient's wishes.
