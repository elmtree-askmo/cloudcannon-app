    What are the best practices for positioning and suctioning newborns?
answer: >-
    Best practices for positioning and suctioning newborns have evolved significantly based on recent guidelines and research. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Routine Suctioning**: It is no longer recommended to perform routine suctioning (oral, nasal, oro-pharyngeal, or endotracheal) immediately after delivery, even for newborns born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Studies have shown that this practice does not improve outcomes and can lead to complications such as bradycardia and apnea. Instead, it is advised to simply wipe the baby's mouth and nose with a towel to clear excess secretions and stimulate respiration.\n\n2. **Positioning**: The optimal positioning of a newborn during and after delivery is crucial. The best position for a newborn is typically the occipito-anterior position, which allows for easier navigation through the birth canal. After birth, maintaining a position that promotes skin-to-skin contact with the mother can help regulate the newborn's temperature and support bonding.\n\n3. **Suctioning Techniques**: If suctioning is necessary (for example, in cases of respiratory distress), it should be performed carefully and only when indicated. The guidelines suggest that suctioning should be done selectively rather than routinely, and healthcare providers should be trained in the appropriate techniques to minimize risks.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Support**: Continuous monitoring of the newborn's respiratory status is essential. If the newborn shows signs of respiratory distress, appropriate interventions should be initiated promptly.\n\n5. **Parental Education**: Educating parents about the importance of positioning and the signs of respiratory distress can empower them to seek help when necessary and understand the care their newborn requires.\n\nIn summary, the best practices for positioning and suctioning newborns focus on minimizing unnecessary interventions, promoting optimal positioning for delivery and recovery, and ensuring that any suctioning performed is done selectively and safely.
