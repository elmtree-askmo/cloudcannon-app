    What is the focus of practice nursing theories?
answer: >-
    The focus of practice nursing theories is primarily on specific, situation-based scenarios within the nursing field. These theories are designed to address particular patient populations and clinical situations, providing concrete strategies for nurses to implement in their practice. Unlike grand nursing theories, which offer broad conceptual frameworks, practice nursing theories are narrow in scope and detail explicit goals and methods for achieving those goals in a defined context.\n\nFor example, practice-level nursing theories may focus on the interactions between nurses and patients, emphasizing the importance of individualized care and the application of the nursing process to meet patient needs. They serve as valuable tools for improving patient care and outcomes by offering practical guidance that can be directly applied in clinical settings.\n\nAdditionally, practice nursing theories contribute to the development of evidence-informed practice by providing a structured approach to patient care, promoting consistency in nursing interventions, and fostering professional growth among nurses. By grounding nursing actions in theoretical frameworks, these theories help nurses articulate the rationale behind their care decisions, ultimately enhancing the quality of nursing practice.
