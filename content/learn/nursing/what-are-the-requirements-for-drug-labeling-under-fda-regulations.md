    Under FDA regulations, drug labeling must meet specific requirements to ensure that healthcare providers and patients have the necessary information to use the drug safely and effectively. The key requirements for drug labeling include:\n\n1. **Product Name**: The label must include the proprietary (trade) name and the established (generic) name of the drug.\n\n2. **Indications and Usage**: A clear statement of the conditions or diseases for which the drug is indicated, including any limitations on use.\n\n3. **Dosage and Administration**: Detailed instructions on how to use the drug, including recommended dosages, routes of administration, and any special instructions for specific populations (e.g., pediatric or geriatric patients).\n\n4. **Contraindications**: Information on situations or conditions under which the drug should not be used.\n\n5. **Warnings and Precautions**: Important safety information, including potential risks and adverse effects associated with the drug. This section may also include black box warnings, which are the most serious warnings issued by the FDA regarding potential risks.\n\n6. **Adverse Reactions**: A list of known adverse effects that may occur with the use of the drug, including their frequency and severity.\n\n7. **Drug Interactions**: Information on how the drug may interact with other medications, foods, or substances.\n\n8. **Use in Specific Populations**: Information regarding the use of the drug in special populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, and patients with specific health conditions.\n\n9. **Clinical Pharmacology**: Information on the drug's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n10. **Storage and Handling**: Instructions on how to properly store and handle the drug to maintain its efficacy and safety.\n\n11. **Patient Counseling Information**: Recommendations for healthcare providers on what to discuss with patients regarding the drug's use, including potential side effects and the importance of adherence to the prescribed regimen.\n\nThese labeling requirements are designed to provide comprehensive information to ensure patient safety and effective use of the drug. The FDA continuously monitors post-marketing safety and can require label changes if new safety concerns arise.
