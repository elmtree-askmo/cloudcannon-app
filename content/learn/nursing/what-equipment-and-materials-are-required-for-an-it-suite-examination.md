    What equipment and materials are required for an IT suite examination?
answer: >-
    For an IT suite examination, the following equipment and materials are typically required:\n\n1. **Computers/Devices**: \n   - Google Chromebooks (supported for G Suite Certifications and G Suite Administrator exams).\n   - Tablets (such as Nexus, iPad, Tab, Note, etc.).\n   - Computers running Linux operating systems or Windows 10 in S mode or Surface RT. Note that the exam should not be run inside a virtual machine.\n\n2. **Monitors**: \n   - All test centers are required to use 24" monitors for exam delivery.\n\n3. **Power Supply**: \n   - It is recommended to connect an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or other power protection devices to the administration workstation or file server to minimize the risk of damage to testing data and equipment.\n\n4. **Network Considerations**: \n   - Ensure that the equipment is connected to a reliable network. If using shared equipment at a university or workplace, be aware of potential firewalls or restrictions that may prevent access to required security features.\n\n5. **Testing Environment**: \n   - The exam should be taken in a private location, such as your home, rather than a public space like a training center or hospital.\n\n6. **Preparation Materials**: \n   - It may be beneficial to have access to study materials and guides relevant to the specific exam being taken, such as the NetSuite SuiteFoundation Exam Prep Guide.\n\n7. **Technical Support**: \n   - If you are not familiar with the setup, consider having IT support available to assist with any technical issues that may arise during the exam.\n\nBy ensuring that you have the appropriate equipment and a suitable environment, you can help facilitate a smooth examination process.
