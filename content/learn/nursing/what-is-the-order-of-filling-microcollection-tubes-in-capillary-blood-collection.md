    What is the order of filling microcollection tubes in capillary blood collection?
answer: >-
    The order of filling microcollection tubes during capillary blood collection is crucial for ensuring accurate test results. According to the guidelines, the recommended order of draw for capillary specimens is as follows:\n\n1. **Gas tubes** (if applicable, ensure the site is warmed before collection)\n2. **Slides** (for blood smears)\n3. **EDTA tubes** (purple top) - These should be collected first to prevent clotting and ensure accurate hematology test results.\n4. **Heparin tubes** (light or dark green top)\n5. **Serum tubes** (red top or amber tube with red top)\n\nIt is important to fill the microtainer tubes to between the 400 and 600 ÂµL fill lines, avoiding overfilling or underfilling, as this can lead to clotting or affect test results. After collection, the tubes should be mixed by inverting them 10 times to ensure proper mixing of the anticoagulant with the blood sample.\n\nThis order of draw is the inverse of the venipuncture order of draw, emphasizing the importance of following these guidelines to maintain specimen integrity and accuracy in laboratory testing.
