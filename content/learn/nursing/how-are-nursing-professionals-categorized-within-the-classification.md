    How are Nursing Professionals categorized within the classification?
answer: >-
    Nursing professionals are categorized within the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) framework, specifically under the codes that pertain to health workers. According to the ISCO-08 classification, nursing professionals are classified under the following codes:\n\n- **2221**: Nursing professionals\n- **2222**: Midwifery professionals\n\nThese classifications are part of a broader structure that organizes health occupations into five main groupings:\n\n1. **Health professionals**: This includes nursing professionals and midwifery professionals.\n2. **Health associate professionals**: This category encompasses nursing associate professionals.\n3. **Personal care workers in health services**: This includes roles that provide direct personal care to patients.\n4. **Health management and support personnel**: This group includes administrative and support roles within healthcare settings.\n5. **Other health service providers not elsewhere classified**: This category captures any health-related occupations that do not fit into the previous classifications.\n\nThe classification system is designed to improve the comparability of health worker data across different countries and regions, facilitating better workforce management and planning. The National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) also align with this mapping, ensuring that data on nursing professionals and other health workers can be effectively analyzed and utilized for health workforce development.\n\nIn summary, nursing professionals are primarily categorized under the ISCO codes 2221 and 2222, reflecting their critical roles in healthcare delivery and the structured approach to health workforce classification.
