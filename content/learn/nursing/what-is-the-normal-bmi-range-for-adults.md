    What is the normal BMI range for adults?
answer: >-
    The normal Body Mass Index (BMI) range for adults is classified as follows:\n\n- **Normal weight**: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9\n\nTo calculate BMI, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\nBMI = \frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2}\n$$\n\nThis classification helps in assessing weight-related health risks. Individuals with a BMI below 18.5 are considered underweight, while those with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 are classified as overweight, and a BMI of 30 or above indicates obesity.\n\nIt's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it has limitations, such as not accounting for muscle mass, fat distribution, and other individual health factors.
