    What is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure?
answer: >-
    The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is fundamental to understanding how blood pressure is measured and what it indicates about cardiovascular health.\n\n1. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: This is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pumps blood. It is represented as the top number in a blood pressure reading. For example, in a reading of 120/80 mmHg, the systolic pressure is 120 mmHg. This value reflects the maximum pressure exerted on the arterial walls during heart contraction.\n\n2. **Diastolic Blood Pressure**: This is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats. It is represented as the bottom number in a blood pressure reading. In the same example of 120/80 mmHg, the diastolic pressure is 80 mmHg. This value indicates the minimum pressure in the arteries when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood.\n\nThe difference between these two values is known as **pulse pressure**, which can provide additional insights into cardiovascular health. A normal pulse pressure is typically around 40 mmHg, but this can vary based on individual health conditions.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and hypotension (low blood pressure). Blood pressure ranges are categorized to help assess these conditions, with normal blood pressure defined as systolic < 120 mmHg and diastolic < 80 mmHg.
