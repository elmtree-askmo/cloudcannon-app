    What are the core attributes of nursing advocacy?
answer: >-
    The core attributes of nursing advocacy, as identified by Bu and Jezewski (2007) in their concept analysis, encompass three main elements:\n\n1. **Safeguarding Patients' Autonomy**: This involves protecting the rights of patients to make informed decisions about their own healthcare. Nurses play a crucial role in ensuring that patients are aware of their options and that their choices are respected. This includes tracking medical errors and protecting patients from incompetency or misconduct by other healthcare team members.\n\n2. **Apprising**: Nurses are responsible for providing patients with essential information regarding their diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. This attribute emphasizes the importance of communication, where nurses suggest alternatives for healthcare and provide information about discharge programs, thereby empowering patients to make informed decisions.\n\n3. **Valuing**: This aspect focuses on maintaining the dignity and worth of patients. It requires nurses to adopt an empathetic attitude, demonstrating responsibility and assertive communication in their interactions. Valuing patients means recognizing their individual needs and preferences, which is fundamental to effective advocacy.\n\nIn addition to these core attributes, nursing advocacy is characterized by the ethical principles of the nursing profession, which include promoting patient autonomy and care. Nurses advocate not only at the bedside but also for systemic changes within healthcare institutions and communities, aiming to improve overall health outcomes and address health disparities. This multifaceted role underscores the importance of nurses in navigating the complexities of the healthcare system and ensuring that patients receive equitable care.
