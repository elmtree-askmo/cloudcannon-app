    Open Educational Resources (OER) available for nursing courses provide valuable teaching, learning, and research materials that can be freely used and repurposed. Here are some notable OER resources specifically tailored for nursing education:\n\n1. **Nursing Fundamentals Textbook**: This is an open educational resource developed for entry-level nursing students, licensed under CC-BY. It is based on the Wisconsin Technical College System (WTCS) statewide nursing curriculum and aligns with the 2019 NCLEX-RN and 2020 NCLEX-PN Test Plans, as well as the Wisconsin Nurse Practice Act.\n\n2. **The Open RN Project**: This initiative includes five OER nursing textbooks and 25 associated virtual reality scenarios. It was led by Chippewa Valley Technical College and aims to enhance nursing education through innovative resources.\n\n3. **MERLOT Materials in Nursing**: This platform offers a collection of educational resources for nursing, although access may require a login.\n\n4. **Clinical Judgment Resources**: Various resources focus on Tanner's Model of Clinical Judgment, which helps nursing students develop critical thinking and decision-making skills essential for clinical practice.\n\n5. **ATI Guide for Clinical Judgment**: This guide assists nurse educators in creating materials that promote clinical judgment skills throughout nursing education.\n\nThese resources are designed to support nursing students in their education and practice, ensuring they have access to high-quality, evidence-based materials that enhance their learning experience.
