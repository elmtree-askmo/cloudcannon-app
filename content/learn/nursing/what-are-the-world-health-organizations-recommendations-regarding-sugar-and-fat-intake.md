    What are the World Health Organization's recommendations regarding sugar and fat intake?
answer: >-
    The World Health Organization (WHO) provides specific dietary recommendations regarding sugar and fat intake to promote better health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Sugar Intake**:\n   - WHO recommends that free sugars should make up less than 10% of total energy intake per day. This includes sugars added to foods and drinks, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.\n   - A further reduction to below 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits. This is approximately 25 grams (or about 6 teaspoons) of sugar per day for an adult.\n\n2. **Fat Intake**:\n   - The WHO advises that total fat intake should not exceed 30% of total energy intake. This includes both saturated and unsaturated fats.\n   - It is recommended to limit saturated fat to less than 10% of total energy intake. This means reducing the consumption of foods high in saturated fats, such as fatty cuts of meat, butter, cheese, and other full-fat dairy products.\n   - Trans fats should be minimized as much as possible, ideally to less than 1% of total energy intake. Trans fats are often found in processed foods and should be avoided due to their association with increased risk of heart disease.\n\n3. **Balancing Caloric Intake**:\n   - The WHO emphasizes the importance of balancing calorie intake with energy expenditure to maintain a healthy weight and prevent obesity.\n\nThese recommendations are part of a broader set of dietary guidelines aimed at improving nutrition and health outcomes globally. By adhering to these guidelines, individuals can reduce their risk of developing diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.
