    How are range of motion tests conducted, and what do they reveal about a patient's condition?
answer: >-
    Range of motion (ROM) tests are essential assessments conducted by physical therapists to evaluate the flexibility and mobility of joints. These tests can be performed in two primary forms: active range of motion (AROM) and passive range of motion (PROM).\n\n### Conducting Range of Motion Tests\n\n1. **Active Range of Motion (AROM)**: This test measures the range of motion that a patient can achieve independently. The patient is instructed to move the joint through its full range without assistance. For example, to assess elbow extension, the patient would actively extend their arm from a flexed position.\n\n2. **Passive Range of Motion (PROM)**: In this test, the therapist moves the patient's joint through its range of motion without any effort from the patient. For instance, to assess knee flexion, the patient may lie supine while the therapist flexes the knee to a maximum angle, typically around 90 degrees, while stabilizing the femur.\n\n3. **Measurement Tools**: A goniometer is commonly used to quantify the angles achieved during these tests. It consists of two arms, one fixed and one movable, allowing precise measurement of joint angles.\n\n4. **End Feel Assessment**: During PROM, therapists also assess the "end feel" of the joint, which refers to the sensation felt at the end of the range of motion. This can provide insights into the condition of the joint, such as whether it is normal, soft, firm, or hard.\n\n### What Range of Motion Tests Reveal\n\nRange of motion tests can reveal several important aspects of a patient's condition:\n\n- **Joint Functionality**: They help determine whether a joint is functioning within its normal range. For example, the normal ROM for an elbow is typically from 0 to 150 degrees. Limitations in this range can indicate underlying issues.\n\n- **Pain and Limitations**: If active range of motion is limited while passive range of motion is full, it may suggest a pain-limited condition rather than a structural issue, such as a frozen shoulder. Conversely, if both active and passive ranges are limited, it may indicate a more significant problem.\n\n- **Assessment of Conditions**: In conditions like tendinopathy, patients often experience pain that leads to decreased activity levels, resulting in impairments in both range of motion and strength. Therefore, measuring both AROM and PROM is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n- **Guiding Treatment Plans**: The results from these tests inform the development of individualized treatment plans, including manual therapy, exercises, and lifestyle adjustments aimed at improving mobility and function.\n\nIn summary, range of motion tests are a fundamental component of physical therapy assessments, providing valuable information about joint health, functionality, and the presence of any underlying conditions.
