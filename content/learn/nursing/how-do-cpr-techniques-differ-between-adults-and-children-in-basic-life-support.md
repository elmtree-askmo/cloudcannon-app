    How do CPR techniques differ between adults and children in basic life support?
answer: >-
    CPR techniques differ between adults and children primarily due to physiological differences and the common causes of cardiac arrest in these age groups. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n### CPR Techniques for Adults\n1. **Compression to Breath Ratio**: The standard technique for adults is to perform 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths.\n2. **Depth and Rate of Compressions**: Chest compressions should be at least 2 inches deep and delivered at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.\n3. **Focus on Compressions**: Emphasis is placed on continuous chest compressions, as they are critical for maintaining blood circulation until advanced help arrives.\n\n### CPR Techniques for Children\n1. **Initial Rescue Breaths**: If the cardiac arrest is suspected to be respiratory in nature, start with 5 rescue breaths before beginning chest compressions.\n2. **Compression to Breath Ratio**: After the initial breaths, the ratio changes to 15 compressions followed by 2 breaths.\n3. **Compression Depth**: For children, compressions should be about 1.5 inches deep, which is less than the depth required for adults, reflecting their smaller body size.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Common Causes of Cardiac Arrest**: In children, cardiac arrests are often related to respiratory issues, whereas in adults, they are more frequently due to cardiac problems.\n- **Technique Adaptation**: The technique may also vary based on the size and age of the child; for infants, a different approach is used, including using two fingers for compressions and a different compression-to-breath ratio.\n\nThese differences highlight the importance of understanding the specific needs of each age group when performing CPR, ensuring that the rescuer can provide the most effective assistance in an emergency situation.
