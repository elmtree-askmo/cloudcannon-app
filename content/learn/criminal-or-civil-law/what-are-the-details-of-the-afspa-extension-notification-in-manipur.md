    What are the details of the AFSPA extension notification in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) has been extended in Manipur for another six months, effective from October 1, 2023. This decision was made by the Manipur government in response to ongoing ethnic violence in the state. The extension applies to all ten hill districts of Manipur but excludes areas under the jurisdiction of 19 police stations, primarily located in the Imphal valley and regions bordering Assam.\n\nThe notification, issued by the Home Department of the Manipur government on September 26, 2023, indicates that the Governor of Manipur believes that violent activities by insurgent groups necessitate the continuation of AFSPA. The Act grants extensive powers to the armed forces, including the authority to arrest without a warrant and to use force in certain situations, which has been a point of contention regarding its impact on civil liberties and law enforcement in the region.\n\nThe extension of AFSPA reflects the government's assessment of the security situation in Manipur, which has been described as "volatile" due to the ongoing ethnic tensions and violence. The Act has been in effect in various parts of Manipur since 1980, with some areas experiencing a withdrawal of its provisions in the past, notably in 2004 following public protests.
