    What is an adjournment motion and when is it used?
answer: >-
    An adjournment motion is a procedural device used in the Indian Parliament, specifically in the Lok Sabha, to interrupt the normal business of the House and discuss urgent public matters that require immediate attention. This motion is introduced by a member of the Lok Sabha to draw the attention of the House to a specific matter of urgent public importance.\n\nTo introduce an adjournment motion, the support of at least 50 members is required. The notice for the motion must be submitted before 10 am on the day it is intended to be raised. If the Speaker of the Lok Sabha admits the motion, the regular business of the House is suspended, allowing for a full debate on the issue at hand.\n\nIt is important to note that the adjournment motion is not available in the Rajya Sabha, as the rules governing that House do not provide for such a motion. Instead, members of the Rajya Sabha may use Rule 267 to suspend Question Hour to raise urgent matters. Additionally, while the passage of an adjournment motion does not necessitate the resignation of the government, it is considered a strong censure of the government's actions or policies. \n\nIn summary, the adjournment motion serves as a critical tool for members of the Lok Sabha to address pressing issues and hold the government accountable.
