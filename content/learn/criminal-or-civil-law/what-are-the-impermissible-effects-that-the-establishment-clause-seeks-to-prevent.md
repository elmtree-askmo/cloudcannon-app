    What are the impermissible effects that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent?
answer: >-
    The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment seeks to prevent several impermissible effects related to the government's interaction with religion. These effects include:\n\n1. **Government Endorsement of Religion**: The government is prohibited from endorsing or favoring one religion over another. This includes any actions that could be interpreted as a preference for a particular faith, which could lead to the establishment of a state religion.\n\n2. **Compulsion of Religious Practices**: The government cannot compel individuals to participate in religious activities or support religious institutions financially. This means that citizens cannot be required to attend religious services or contribute to religious organizations.\n\n3. **Interference with Religious Organizations**: The government is not allowed to interfere with the internal governance of religious organizations, including their selection of clergy or the determination of religious doctrine. This ensures that religious groups can operate independently of government influence.\n\n4. **Excessive Entanglement**: The Establishment Clause aims to avoid excessive entanglement between government and religious institutions. This includes situations where government funding or support could lead to a close relationship that blurs the lines between church and state.\n\n5. **Discriminatory Benefits**: The government cannot extend benefits to some religious entities while denying them to others without a valid secular justification. This principle ensures that all religious groups are treated equally under the law.\n\n6. **Promotion or Inhibition of Religion**: Any government action must have a secular purpose and must neither advance nor inhibit religion in its primary effect. This is often evaluated through the "Lemon test," which assesses whether a law or policy meets these criteria.\n\nThese impermissible effects are designed to maintain a separation between church and state, ensuring that the government remains neutral in matters of religion and that individuals are free to practice their beliefs without government interference or support.
