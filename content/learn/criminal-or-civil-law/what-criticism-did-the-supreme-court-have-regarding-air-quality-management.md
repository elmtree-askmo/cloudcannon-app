    What criticism did the Supreme Court have regarding air quality management?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court has expressed criticism regarding air quality management, particularly in the context of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) and the measures implemented to address severe air pollution in Delhi. Specifically, the Court ordered the CAQM to review its decision on the closure of schools in the National Capital Region, emphasizing the need for a careful evaluation of the impact of such measures on students, particularly those in classes 10 to 12.\n\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has mandated that the GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan) Stage IV measures, which are currently in place to combat the severe air quality crisis in Delhi, should continue to be enforced, except in schools. This indicates the Court's concern for maintaining a balance between public health and educational needs during periods of poor air quality.\n\nThese actions reflect the Court's critical stance on the effectiveness and implementation of air quality management strategies, highlighting the necessity for ongoing assessment and adjustment of policies to ensure they serve the best interests of the public.
