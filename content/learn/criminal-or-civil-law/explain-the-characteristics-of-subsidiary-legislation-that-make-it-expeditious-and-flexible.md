    Explain the characteristics of subsidiary legislation that make it expeditious and flexible.
answer: >-
    Subsidiary legislation, also known as delegated or subordinate legislation, possesses several characteristics that contribute to its expeditious and flexible nature. Here are the key characteristics:\n\n1. **Delegated Authority**: Subsidiary legislation is created by individuals or bodies to whom Parliament has delegated law-making authority. This delegation allows for the creation of detailed regulations without the need for a full legislative process, enabling quicker responses to specific issues or changing circumstances.\n\n2. **Specificity and Detail**: It allows for the formulation of detailed and specific regulations that can address particular aspects of the law. This specificity helps in implementing the broader principles established in the parent legislation, making it easier to manage complex legal frameworks.\n\n3. **Clarity**: Subsidiary legislation can clarify ambiguous provisions in the parent law. By providing detailed guidelines, it enhances understanding and compliance among individuals and organizations, which is essential for effective law enforcement.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The process of creating subsidiary legislation is generally more efficient than enacting primary legislation. It streamlines the implementation of laws by providing necessary guidelines and procedures, thus reducing the time and resources required for legislative changes.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: Subsidiary legislation can be amended or revoked more easily than primary legislation. This flexibility allows for quick adjustments in response to new developments, societal needs, or practical challenges, ensuring that the law remains relevant and effective.\n\n6. **Protection of Rights**: It can also serve to protect the rights and interests of individuals or groups affected by the parent law, ensuring that specific needs are addressed without the lengthy process of amending primary legislation.\n\n7. **Types of Instruments**: Subsidiary legislation can take various forms, including by-laws, regulations, orders, and rules. This variety allows for tailored approaches to different legal contexts and issues, further enhancing its adaptability.\n\nIn summary, the characteristics of subsidiary legislation—such as delegated authority, specificity, clarity, efficiency, flexibility, and the ability to protect rights—make it a vital tool in the legal framework, allowing for effective and responsive governance.
