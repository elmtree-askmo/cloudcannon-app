    How do structural inequities and inequalities manifest in public and private law?
answer: >-
    Structural inequities and inequalities manifest in both public and private law in various ways, often reflecting broader societal issues such as systemic racism, socioeconomic disparities, and power imbalances.\n\nIn public law, which encompasses areas such as constitutional, administrative, and criminal law, structural inequities can be seen in the enforcement and application of laws. For instance, marginalized groups, including Indigenous and Black individuals, often face overrepresentation in the criminal justice system, which highlights systemic racism and biases within public law enforcement. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms aims to address these inequities by promoting fairness and equality; however, the reality of its application can fall short, as evidenced by the challenges faced by these communities in accessing justice and receiving equitable treatment under the law.\n\nMoreover, public law is influenced by the government's ability to enforce laws and regulations. Structural inequalities can arise from deficiencies in federal directives and the division of jurisdictional responsibilities, leading to substantial inequities in public services. For example, the response to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has revealed longstanding health inequities for marginalized groups, indicating that public law must evolve to address these systemic issues effectively.\n\nIn private law, which governs relationships between individuals and entities, structural inequities can manifest through socioeconomic biases that affect judicial decision-making. Research indicates that implicit socioeconomic bias may influence judges, potentially leading to unequal treatment of parties based on their economic status. This can result in disparities in outcomes for individuals seeking redress in civil matters, such as torts or contracts, where the enforcement of rights and obligations is primarily the responsibility of the parties involved.\n\nTo address these structural inequalities, scholars suggest implementing structural remedies that go beyond incremental approaches. These include imposing limits on private power, investing in public goods, and enhancing oversight and enforcement by administrative agencies. Such strategies aim to create a more equitable legal framework that recognizes and addresses the underlying causes of structural inequities in both public and private law.\n\nIn summary, structural inequities and inequalities in public and private law are deeply intertwined with societal issues, requiring comprehensive strategies to ensure justice and equality for all individuals within the legal system.
