    What are differentiating measures reviewed by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights?
answer: >-
    The differentiating measures reviewed by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) refer to provisions in proposed legislation that may disadvantage specific racial or religious communities. The PCMR's role is to assess whether any clauses in a Bill are discriminatory. If the Council identifies any differentiating measures, it can recommend amendments to the Bill to ensure compliance with the principles of equality and non-discrimination.\n\nSpecifically, a differentiating measure is defined as any measure that is, or is likely to be, disadvantageous to individuals of any racial or religious community, while not equally disadvantageous to individuals of other communities. This can occur either directly, by prejudicing members of a particular community, or indirectly, by providing advantages to members of another community.\n\nThe process is crucial for maintaining social harmony and protecting minority rights in Singapore. If the PCMR finds discriminatory provisions, it can refer the Bill back to Parliament for consideration of amendments. Parliament then has the option to amend the Bill and resubmit it to the Council or to present the Bill to the President despite the Council's adverse report.\n\nThis review process is an essential part of the legislative framework in Singapore, ensuring that laws uphold the values of equality and non-discrimination across different racial and religious groups.
