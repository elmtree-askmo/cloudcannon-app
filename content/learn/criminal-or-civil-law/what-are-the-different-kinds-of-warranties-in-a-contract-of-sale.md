    What are the different kinds of warranties in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Sale of Goods Act, warranties are guarantees provided by the seller regarding the quality and condition of the goods being sold. There are two primary types of warranties in a contract of sale: express warranties and implied warranties.\n\n1. **Express Warranties**: These are explicitly stated guarantees made by the seller, either verbally or in writing. An express warranty may include specific claims about the product's quality, performance, or condition. For example, if a seller states that a car has never been in an accident, this statement constitutes an express warranty.\n\n2. **Implied Warranties**: These warranties arise automatically by law and do not need to be explicitly stated in the contract. The Sale of Goods Act recognizes several implied warranties, including:\n   - **Implied Warranty of Merchantability**: This warranty ensures that the goods sold are of average acceptable quality and fit for the general purpose for which they are sold. It applies when the seller is a merchant.\n   - **Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: This warranty applies when the seller knows that the buyer intends to use the goods for a specific purpose, and the buyer relies on the seller's expertise to select suitable goods.\n   - **Warranty of Title**: This warranty guarantees that the seller has the right to sell the goods and that the goods are free from any liens or encumbrances.\n\nAdditionally, the Sale of Goods Act includes other implied warranties, such as the warranty of undisturbed possession, which ensures that the buyer will have quiet possession of the goods without interference.\n\nUnderstanding these warranties is crucial for both buyers and sellers, as they define the obligations and protections available in a sales contract.
