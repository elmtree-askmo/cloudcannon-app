    How is partial delivery of goods handled in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Sale of Goods Act, the handling of partial delivery of goods is addressed primarily in Section 34, which discusses the implications of such deliveries on the transfer of property rights. According to this section, if a seller delivers a portion of the goods, it can be considered as delivery of the entire lot if it is part of a progressive delivery process. This means that partial deliveries can be recognized as valid under certain conditions, particularly when they are agreed upon in the contract.\n\nAdditionally, the Sale of Goods Act outlines that the buyer must accept part of the goods sold and actually receive them for the transaction to be valid. This acceptance is crucial as it establishes the buyer's rights concerning the goods delivered. The Act also emphasizes that delivery can be made in various forms, including symbolic delivery, where the buyer gains control over the goods without physical possession.\n\nMoreover, the seller has the responsibility to ensure that partial shipments are delivered as per the agreed terms. The contract should clearly outline the terms regarding partial deliveries, including any adjustments to payment based on the quantity delivered. This clarity helps mitigate potential disputes between the buyer and seller regarding the acceptance and payment for partial shipments.\n\nIn summary, partial delivery of goods in a contract of sale is handled by recognizing it as valid under specific conditions, ensuring that both parties understand their rights and obligations, and clearly defining the terms in the sales contract.
