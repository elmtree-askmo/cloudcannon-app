    What are the requirements for proving identity and residency for licenses?
answer: >-
    To prove identity and residency when applying for a driver's license, applicants typically need to provide specific documents, which can vary by state. Here are the general requirements based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Proof of Identity**: Applicants must present at least one document that verifies their identity. Acceptable forms of identification often include:\n   - A valid, unexpired driver's license or state ID from another state.\n   - A U.S. passport or passport card.\n   - A military ID.\n   - A birth certificate (often accompanied by a government-issued photo ID).\n\n2. **Proof of Residency**: Applicants are usually required to provide two documents that confirm their residency. These documents must contain the individual's name and residential address. Commonly accepted documents include:\n   - Utility bills (e.g., water, electricity, gas) with the current address.\n   - Bank statements.\n   - Lease agreements or mortgage documents.\n   - Voter registration cards.\n   - Tax records.\n\n3. **Additional Requirements for Minors**: If the applicant is a minor, additional documentation may be required, such as proof of parental consent.\n\n4. **State-Specific Variations**: \n   - In Texas, for example, applicants must prove they have lived in the state for at least 30 days unless they are surrendering a valid, unexpired driver license or ID from another state, in which case the 30-day requirement is waived.\n   - In Pennsylvania, applicants must provide a list of acceptable documents for proof of identity and residency, which may differ for U.S. and non-U.S. citizens.\n\n5. **Social Security Number**: Many states also require proof of the applicant's Social Security number, which can be shown through a Social Security card or other official documents.\n\n6. **Document Authenticity**: All documents presented must be original or certified copies; photocopies are typically not accepted.\n\nIt is important for applicants to check the specific requirements of their stateâ€™s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or equivalent agency, as these requirements can vary significantly.
