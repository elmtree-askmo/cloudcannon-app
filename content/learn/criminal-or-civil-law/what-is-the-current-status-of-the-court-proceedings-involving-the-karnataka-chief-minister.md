    What is the current status of the court proceedings involving the Karnataka Chief Minister?
answer: >-
    As of now, the Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is facing legal challenges related to the alleged Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam. The Karnataka High Court has recently extended the interim stay on trial court proceedings against him, allowing him some relief while his petition is being heard. Specifically, the court has directed the Special Court for People's Representatives in Bengaluru to defer all proceedings against him until a petition regarding the case is resolved.\n\nOn February 19, the Supreme Court also stayed the proceedings in a criminal case against Siddaramaiah related to a protest march he conducted in 2022. However, the situation has been dynamic, with the Karnataka High Court admitting his writ petition seeking to quash the Governor's order that sanctioned his prosecution in the MUDA scam case. The next hearing in this matter is scheduled for August 29.\n\nIn a recent development, the Karnataka High Court dismissed Siddaramaiah's petition challenging the legality of the Governor's approval for an investigation into the allegations of irregularities in the allotment of MUDA sites to his wife. This ruling represents a significant setback for the Chief Minister, as it allows the investigation to proceed.\n\nOverall, the legal proceedings involving Siddaramaiah are ongoing, with multiple hearings and decisions impacting the status of the cases against him.
