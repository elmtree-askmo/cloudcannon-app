    What was the background leading to the Supreme Court ruling on caste discrimination in prisons?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court ruling on caste discrimination in prisons emerged from a significant legal and social context regarding the treatment of prisoners in India. The background leading to this ruling can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Caste Discrimination in Prisons**: The issue of caste-based discrimination within Indian prisons has been a longstanding problem, where prisoners from marginalized castes were often relegated to menial labor, such as cleaning, while others were assigned more dignified tasks like cooking. This segregation was rooted in prison manuals that reflected traditional caste roles, perpetuating a system of inequality even within the penal system.\n\n2. **Legal Challenge**: The case was initiated by journalist Sukanya Shantha, who published an article titled “From Segregation to Labour, Manu’s Caste Law Governs the Indian Prison System.” This article highlighted the stark realities of caste discrimination in prisons and prompted legal action. Shantha filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging various state prison manuals that sanctioned caste-based division of labor and labeled certain communities, particularly de-notified tribes, as “habitual offenders,” a classification rooted in colonial-era policies.\n\n3. **Constitutional Violations**: The Supreme Court found that the practices outlined in prison manuals violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, particularly Articles 14 (right to equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination), 17 (abolition of untouchability), and 21 (right to life and personal liberty). The court emphasized that the dignity of all individuals, including those incarcerated, must be maintained, and that discrimination based on caste amounted to untouchability, which is explicitly forbidden under Article 17.\n\n4. **Judicial Findings**: The Supreme Court declared that the provisions in prison manuals from over ten states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Maharashtra, which sanctioned caste discrimination and forced labor, were unconstitutional. The court ordered the Centre and states to revise their prison manuals within three months to eliminate any references to caste and ensure compliance with constitutional mandates.\n\n5. **Call for Reform**: The ruling not only addressed the immediate issue of caste discrimination in prisons but also called for broader reforms in the Indian penal system, which has been criticized for its colonial legacy and focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court ruling on caste discrimination in prisons was a response to systemic injustices highlighted by activists and journalists, leading to a landmark decision aimed at upholding the dignity and rights of all prisoners, regardless of their caste.
