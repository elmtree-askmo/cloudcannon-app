    How did the Supreme Court intervene in the NEET-UG Exam Controversy?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India intervened in the NEET-UG Exam Controversy by dismissing a batch of petitions that sought the cancellation and re-test of the NEET-UG 2024 examination. On July 23, 2024, the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support claims of a systemic breach of the exam's integrity. The Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, leading the bench, emphasized that ordering a re-test would have serious implications for the approximately 24 lakh students who had taken the exam.\n\nThe court's decision was based on the absence of concrete evidence indicating that the examination results were compromised. The ruling aimed to provide certainty and finality to a situation that significantly affects the careers of many students. The Supreme Court stated that any decision regarding a re-examination must be grounded in substantial evidence demonstrating that the integrity of the test was indeed compromised.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court's intervention was a decisive rejection of the calls for a re-test, reinforcing the need for stability in the examination process and the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the NEET-UG examination.
