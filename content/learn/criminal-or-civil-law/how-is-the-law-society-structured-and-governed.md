    How is the Law Society structured and governed?
answer: >-
    The Law Society is structured as a private membership body with the legal status of a chartered corporation. It was originally founded in 1825 and operates under the Royal Charter of 1845, along with subsequent supplemental charters. The governing body of the Law Society is the Council, which is composed of approximately 100 elected members who represent various demographic groups and areas of law across England and Wales. This Council is supported by around 300 volunteer board and committee members who assist in delivering advice, support, and services to the members.\n\nThe President of the Law Society serves as the head and acts as the main ambassador for the legal profession, representing the interests of the Society and its members. The day-to-day management and administrative functions are overseen by the Chief Executive of the Law Society.\n\nThe governance structure has remained largely unchanged since the establishment of the Law Society as a national body on August 1, 2008, with the exception of the inclusion of paralegal licensees on the board. This structure has been noted to present challenges in making timely decisions that align with the Law Society's statutory mandate.\n\nAdditionally, the Law Society operates under Internal Governance Rules (IGRs) established by the Legal Services Board (LSB), which serves as the overarching regulator of legal services in England and Wales. This governance framework ensures that the Law Society adheres to established standards and practices while fulfilling its regulatory role within the legal profession.
