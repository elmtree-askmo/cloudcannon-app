    How is the delivery of the wrong quantity of goods addressed in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the delivery of the wrong quantity of goods is specifically addressed in Section 37. This section outlines the rights and obligations of both the seller and the buyer when the quantity of goods delivered does not match what was contracted.\n\n1. **Delivery of Less Than Contracted Quantity**: If the seller delivers a quantity of goods that is less than what was agreed upon in the contract, the buyer has the right to reject the goods. However, if the buyer chooses to accept the goods that were delivered, they are required to pay for them at the contract rate.\n\n2. **Delivery of More Than Contracted Quantity**: If the seller delivers more goods than what was contracted, the buyer may accept the excess goods and is only obligated to pay for the quantity that was agreed upon in the contract. The buyer can choose to reject the excess goods as well.\n\n3. **General Implications**: The provisions in Section 37 ensure that buyers are protected against receiving less than what they paid for, while also allowing some flexibility in cases where more goods are delivered. This framework helps maintain fairness in commercial transactions and provides clear guidelines for both parties involved in the sale.\n\nOverall, the Sale of Goods Act provides a legal framework that governs the performance of contracts, including the delivery of goods, ensuring that both buyers and sellers understand their rights and responsibilities in the event of discrepancies in quantity.
