    How does the warranty as to freedom from encumbrances protect the buyer?
answer: >-
    The warranty as to freedom from encumbrances is a crucial protection for buyers under the Sale of Goods Act, particularly outlined in Section 14(c). This warranty implies that the goods sold are free from any charges or encumbrances in favor of third parties that the buyer is not aware of at the time of the contract.\n\nHere are the key aspects of how this warranty protects the buyer:\n\n1. **Implied Assurance**: The warranty provides an implied assurance that the goods are not subject to any undisclosed claims or liens. This means that the buyer can expect to receive goods that are free from any legal or financial burdens that could affect their ownership or use.\n\n2. **Right to Compensation**: If it turns out that the goods are encumbered and the buyer faces any disturbance in possession due to these encumbrances, the buyer has the right to claim damages from the seller. This serves as a financial safeguard for the buyer against unforeseen liabilities.\n\n3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: The warranty protects the buyer from potential claims by third parties who may assert rights over the goods. If a third party has a claim that the buyer was unaware of, the buyer can seek recourse from the seller, ensuring that they are not left to deal with these issues alone.\n\n4. **Quiet Possession**: The warranty also implies the buyer's right to quiet possession of the goods. This means that the buyer can use and enjoy the goods without interference from third parties claiming rights over them.\n\nIn summary, the warranty as to freedom from encumbrances under the Sale of Goods Act provides essential protection for buyers, ensuring that they acquire goods that are free from hidden liabilities and allowing them to seek compensation if any issues arise post-purchase. This legal framework helps to foster trust and security in commercial transactions.
