    What stance did India take on cross-border terrorism during the SCO meeting?
answer: >-
    During the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, India took a strong stance against cross-border terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the summit, emphasized that terrorism poses a significant threat to both regional and global peace, calling for a decisive response to combat it. He highlighted the need for the SCO to not hesitate in criticizing countries that use cross-border terrorism as an instrument of their policies and provide shelter to terrorists.\n\nIndia's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, echoed these sentiments, stating that cross-border terrorism requires a united and resolute response from the international community. He underscored the importance of isolating nations that harbor terrorists and condone such activities, reinforcing that combating terrorism is a foundational goal of the SCO.\n\nThis emphasis on cross-border terrorism has been a consistent theme for India since it became a full member of the SCO in 2017, with the issue being raised at every summit. The Indian leadership's remarks at the recent meeting reflect a broader concern about the use of terrorism as a tool for destabilization by certain countries, which India has experienced firsthand.
