    The fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution, particularly in the context of Singapore, are outlined in Part IV of the Constitution. These liberties include:\n\n1. **Freedom of Speech**: Article 14 guarantees every citizen the right to express their opinions freely. However, this right may be subject to restrictions for reasons such as national security or public order.\n\n2. **Freedom of the Press and Publication**: This encompasses the right to publish and disseminate information without censorship, allowing for a free press.\n\n3. **Freedom of Association**: Individuals have the right to form and join associations, including trade unions and political parties, promoting collective interests.\n\n4. **Freedom of Assembly**: The right to gather peacefully for demonstrations and public meetings is protected, allowing citizens to express their views collectively.\n\n5. **Freedom of Procession and Demonstration**: Residents can organize and participate in public processions and demonstrations, which are essential for public expression.\n\n6. **Freedom of the Person**: This includes the right to personal liberty and protection against arbitrary detention, ensuring that individuals cannot be unlawfully imprisoned.\n\n7. **Freedom of Communication**: Individuals have the right to communicate freely, which includes various forms of media and expression.\n\n8. **Freedom of Religious Belief**: Individuals are free to practice their religion or beliefs without interference from the state, ensuring religious diversity and tolerance.\n\nThese fundamental liberties are crucial for the protection of individual rights and the promotion of a democratic society. However, it is important to note that these rights may be subject to limitations as deemed necessary by law, particularly in the interest of public order and national security.
