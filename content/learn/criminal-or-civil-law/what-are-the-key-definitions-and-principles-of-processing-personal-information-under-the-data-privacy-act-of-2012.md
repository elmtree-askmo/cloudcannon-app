Here are the key definitions and principles related to the processing of personal information under this Act:\n\n### Key Definitions\n\n1. **Personal Data**: Refers to any information, whether recorded in a material form or not, from which the identity of an individual is apparent or can be reasonably and directly ascertained, or when put together with other information would directly and certainly identify an individual.\n\n2. **Sensitive Personal Information**: This includes personal data that reveals an individual's race, ethnic origin, marital status, age, color, and other sensitive attributes. Processing of sensitive personal information is generally prohibited unless specific conditions are met.\n\n3. **Personal Information Controller (PIC)**: Refers to a natural or juridical person who controls the processing of personal data, including those who determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.\n\n4. **Personal Information Processor (PIP)**: Refers to a natural or juridical person who processes personal data on behalf of a personal information controller.\n\n5. **Data Subject**: An individual whose personal data is being processed.\n\n6. **Processing**: Refers to any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, including collection, recording, organization, storage, updating, retrieval, use, disclosure, and destruction.\n\n### Principles of Processing Personal Information\n\n1. **Transparency**: Data subjects must be informed whether their personal information is being processed, and they should be provided with clear information about the purpose of processing, the scope, and the recipients of the data.\n\n2. **Legitimacy of Purpose**: Personal data must be processed for legitimate purposes that are specified and lawful. The purposes should be explicitly stated to the data subjects.\n\n3. **Proportionality**: The processing of personal data must be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\n\n4. **Data Subject Rights**: The Act grants data subjects specific rights, including:\n   - The right to be informed about the processing of their personal data.\n   - The right to access their personal data.\n   - The right to correct any inaccuracies in their personal data.\n   - The right to object to the processing of their personal data.\n   - The right to data portability, allowing them to manage their data across different platforms.\n\n5. **Consent**: Processing of personal data generally requires the consent of the data subject, particularly for sensitive personal information. Consent must be specific, informed, and freely given.\n\n6. **Security of Personal Data**: Personal information controllers and processors are required to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration.\n\n7. **Accountability**: Personal information controllers are accountable for complying with the provisions of the Data Privacy Act and must demonstrate compliance with its requirements.\n\n### Exemptions\n\nThe Data Privacy Act does not apply to certain types of information, such as:\n- Information about government employees related to their official functions.\n- Personal data processed for journalistic, artistic, literary, or research purposes.\n- Information necessary for the performance of public authority functions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Data Privacy Act of 2012 establishes a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal information in the Philippines, balancing the rights of individuals with the needs of organizations to process data. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and the protection of data subjects' rights, ensuring that personal information is handled responsibly and ethically.
