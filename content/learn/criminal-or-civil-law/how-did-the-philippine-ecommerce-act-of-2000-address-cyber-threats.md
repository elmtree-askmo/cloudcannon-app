answer: >-
    The Philippine E-commerce Act of 2000, officially known as Republic Act No. 8792, was a significant legislative response to the emerging challenges posed by cyber threats and the growing importance of electronic transactions in the country. Here are the key ways in which the Act addressed cyber threats:\n\n1. **Legal Recognition of Electronic Transactions**: The E-commerce Act provided a legal framework for electronic transactions, recognizing the validity of electronic documents and signatures. This was crucial in establishing trust in online transactions, which is essential for mitigating risks associated with cyber fraud.\n\n2. **Regulation of Digital Evidence**: The Act included provisions for the admissibility of electronic evidence in legal proceedings. This was a critical step in ensuring that electronic transactions could be effectively monitored and that any fraudulent activities could be prosecuted.\n\n3. **Consumer Protection**: The E-commerce Act aimed to protect consumers engaging in electronic transactions by mandating transparency and accountability from service providers. This included requirements for clear information about products and services, which helps to reduce the risk of online scams.\n\n4. **Facilitation of E-commerce Growth**: By creating a conducive environment for e-commerce, the Act indirectly addressed cyber threats by promoting the development of secure online platforms. This included the establishment of guidelines for electronic payments and banking, which are essential for secure transactions.\n\n5. **Complementary Legislation**: The E-commerce Act laid the groundwork for subsequent laws, such as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, which specifically targeted cybercrime and provided more robust measures against various forms of online criminal activity.\n\n6. **Administrative Orders and Guidelines**: Following the enactment of the E-commerce Act, various administrative orders were issued to further clarify and regulate aspects of electronic commerce, including digital signatures and e-banking, which are vital for secure online transactions.\n\nIn summary, the E-commerce Act of 2000 was a pioneering piece of legislation in the Philippines that not only facilitated the growth of electronic commerce but also laid the foundation for addressing cyber threats through legal recognition, consumer protection, and the establishment of a framework for electronic evidence.
