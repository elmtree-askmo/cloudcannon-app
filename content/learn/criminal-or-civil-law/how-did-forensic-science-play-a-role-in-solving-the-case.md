answer: >-
    Forensic science played a crucial role in solving the case of Madison Rutherford, particularly through the application of forensic anthropology and criminalistics. In the investigation, forensic experts utilized various scientific techniques to analyze evidence from the crime scene, which included examining skeletal remains.\n\nOne significant aspect of the forensic investigation was the examination of bones found at the scene. Forensic anthropologist Dr. Bass noted that the skeletal remains were arthritic and too old for a man in his 30s, which indicated that they did not belong to Madison Rutherford. This analysis helped to rule out potential identities and guided investigators toward understanding the circumstances surrounding the remains.\n\nAdditionally, forensic science encompasses a broad range of techniques that are essential in criminal investigations, including the analysis of financial records and the tracing of illicit funds. In cases involving fraud, such as those related to insurance or financial crimes, forensic accountants play a vital role by documenting methods used to commit fraud and providing evidence that can lead to convictions.\n\nOverall, the integration of forensic science in the investigation of Madison Rutherford's case not only helped to clarify the identity of the remains but also highlighted the importance of forensic techniques in uncovering the truth behind complex criminal activities. This case exemplifies how forensic science can impact criminal investigations and contribute to the resolution of cases involving fraud and deception.
