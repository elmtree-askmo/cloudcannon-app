    How is the term of the Lok Sabha determined?
answer: >-
    The term of the Lok Sabha, which is the lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, is determined to be five years from the date appointed for its first meeting after general elections. This five-year term is established by the Constitution of India. However, the Lok Sabha can be dissolved before the completion of this term by the President of India, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. In such cases, early elections may be held to reconstitute the house.\n\nThe Lok Sabha can have a maximum of 550 members, with 530 representing the states and 20 representing the Union Territories. Currently, the Lok Sabha has 543 seats filled by elected representatives, who are chosen through direct elections by the people of India via universal adult suffrage.\n\nIn summary, the Lok Sabha's term is fixed at five years, but it is subject to dissolution, which can lead to early elections if necessary.
