answer: >-
    Section 21 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, plays a crucial role in the context of passing property in ascertained goods. This section specifically addresses situations where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the seller is required to perform certain actions to make those goods deliverable.\n\nThe significance of Section 21 can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Condition for Passing of Property**: According to Section 21, the property in specific goods does not pass to the buyer until the seller has completed the necessary actions to put the goods into a deliverable state. This means that if the seller is obligated to do something to the goods (such as packaging, assembling, or any other preparatory work), the transfer of ownership is contingent upon the completion of that work.\n\n2. **Notice Requirement**: The property will only pass once the seller has completed the required actions and the buyer has been notified of this completion. This ensures that the buyer is aware that the goods are ready for delivery, which is essential for the transfer of ownership.\n\n3. **Legal Clarity**: This provision provides legal clarity and protection for both parties involved in the transaction. It prevents situations where a buyer might assume ownership of goods that are not yet ready for delivery, thereby avoiding potential disputes regarding ownership and liability.\n\n4. **Applicability to Specific Goods**: Section 21 is particularly relevant for contracts involving specific or ascertained goods, as opposed to generic goods. This distinction is important because it emphasizes the need for the seller to fulfill specific obligations before ownership can be transferred.\n\nIn summary, Section 21 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, establishes a clear framework for the passing of property in specific goods, ensuring that ownership is only transferred when the seller has fulfilled their obligations and the buyer is duly informed. This provision is essential for maintaining fairness and clarity in commercial transactions involving specific goods.
