    What is the warranty as to undisturbed possession in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    The warranty as to undisturbed possession in a contract of sale is an important legal concept that ensures a buyer's right to enjoy the goods purchased without interference. According to Section 14(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, there is an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods. This means that once the buyer has taken possession of the goods, they should not be disturbed by the seller or any third party.\n\nIf the buyer is later disturbed in their possession—meaning that someone, including the seller, attempts to reclaim the goods or otherwise interferes with the buyer's use of them—the buyer has the right to sue the seller for breach of this warranty. This warranty is inherent in sales contracts unless explicitly excluded by the terms of the contract or by the course of dealings between the parties, as outlined in Section 62 of the Sale of Goods Act.\n\nIn summary, the warranty as to undisturbed possession guarantees that the buyer can enjoy their purchase without fear of being dispossessed, providing a layer of protection and legal recourse in case of disputes.
