    How does written law differ from unwritten law?
answer: >-
    Written law and unwritten law represent two fundamental categories of legal systems, each with distinct characteristics and implications for legal practice and research.\n\n**Written Law**:\n- Written law consists of codified statutes and regulations that are formally enacted and documented. This includes legislation passed by legislative bodies, subsidiary legislation (such as regulations and orders), and constitutional provisions. \n- The primary advantage of written law is its clarity and accessibility. Citizens can refer to these documents to understand their rights and obligations, which promotes transparency and consistency in the application of the law. \n- Historical examples of written law include the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known legal codes, and the Twelve Tables of ancient Rome, which provided a clear framework for legal enforcement and specified penalties for violations.\n\n**Unwritten Law**:\n- Unwritten law, on the other hand, encompasses legal principles that are not codified in a single document. This includes common law or case law, which evolves through judicial decisions and precedents established by courts over time. \n- Unwritten law is often based on customs, traditions, and societal practices, which can vary significantly between different cultures and legal systems. For instance, customary law has played a significant role in various legal traditions, influencing legal decisions and the application of statutes.\n- The flexibility of unwritten law allows it to adapt to changing social norms and values, but it can also lead to uncertainty, as individuals may not have a clear reference point for understanding their legal rights and obligations.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between written and unwritten law lies in their form and source. Written law is codified and accessible, providing a clear legal framework, while unwritten law is based on judicial decisions and societal customs, allowing for adaptability but potentially leading to ambiguity. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective legal research and application.
