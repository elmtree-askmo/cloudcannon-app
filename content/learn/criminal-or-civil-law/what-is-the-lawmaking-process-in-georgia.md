    What is the lawmaking process in Georgia?
answer: >-
    The lawmaking process in Georgia is structured and involves several key steps, similar to the federal legislative process. Hereâ€™s an overview of how a bill becomes law in the state:\n\n1. **Bill Drafting and Introduction**: The process begins when a legislator identifies an issue they wish to address. They can propose a new law or amend an existing one. This proposed legislation is then drafted and introduced in either the Georgia House of Representatives or the Senate.\n\n2. **Legislative Session**: The Georgia General Assembly convenes for a legislative session that lasts for 40 legislative days, which do not need to be consecutive. The final day of the session, known as Sine Die, typically occurs in late March or early April.\n\n3. **Committee Review**: Once a bill is introduced, it is assigned to a committee that specializes in the relevant area. The committee reviews the bill, holds hearings, and may make amendments. If the committee approves the bill, it is sent to the floor of the respective house for debate.\n\n4. **Debate and Voting**: The bill is debated by all members of the house. Amendments may be proposed and voted on. If the bill passes by a majority vote, it moves to the other house (House or Senate) for consideration.\n\n5. **Consideration by the Other House**: The second house repeats the process of committee review, debate, and voting. If the second house makes changes to the bill, it must return to the originating house for approval of those changes.\n\n6. **Final Approval**: If both houses agree on the final version of the bill, it is sent to the Governor.\n\n7. **Governor's Action**: The Governor has several options upon receiving the bill:\n   - Sign the bill into law.\n   - Allow the bill to become law without a signature.\n   - Veto the bill, which can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses.\n\n8. **Publication**: Once signed or allowed to become law, the new law is published in the Georgia Laws series and codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.).\n\nThis structured process ensures that legislation is thoroughly reviewed and debated before becoming law, reflecting the principles of democracy and governance in Georgia.
