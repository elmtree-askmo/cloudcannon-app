    What are the essential elements required for the formation of a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    The essential elements required for the formation of a contract of sale, particularly under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, include the following:\n\n1. **Two Parties**: There must be at least two parties involved in the contract, typically referred to as the seller and the buyer. Each party must have the legal capacity to enter into the contract.\n\n2. **Items to be Sold**: The contract must clearly specify the goods or property being sold. This is crucial to avoid confusion and ensure that both parties understand what is being exchanged.\n\n3. **Price**: There must be a price agreed upon for the goods being sold. This price can be in monetary terms or another form of consideration.\n\n4. **Transfer of Ownership**: The contract must involve the transfer of ownership of the goods from the seller to the buyer. This transfer is a fundamental aspect of a sale contract.\n\n5. **Legality of Subject Matter**: The subject matter of the contract must be legal. Any contract involving illegal goods or services is void and unenforceable.\n\n6. **Free Consent**: Both parties must enter into the contract voluntarily and with a clear understanding of the terms. There should be no coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, or fraud involved.\n\nThese elements ensure that the contract of sale is valid and enforceable. Additionally, the contract can be either absolute or conditional, depending on the terms agreed upon by the parties involved.
