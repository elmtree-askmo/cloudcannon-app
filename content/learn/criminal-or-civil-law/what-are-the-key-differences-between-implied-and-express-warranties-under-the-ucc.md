    What are the key differences between implied and express warranties under the UCC?
answer: >-
    Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), there are two primary types of warranties: express warranties and implied warranties. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Express Warranty**: This is a warranty that is explicitly stated by the seller, either verbally or in writing. It can be created through affirmations of fact, promises, descriptions of the goods, or the provision of samples or models. For example, if a seller states that a product is "waterproof," this constitutes an express warranty.\n   - **Implied Warranty**: This type of warranty is not explicitly stated but is automatically assumed to exist when goods are sold. Implied warranties provide a baseline level of protection for consumers without the need for specific affirmations from the seller.\n\n2. **Creation**:\n   - **Express Warranty**: Created through the seller's explicit representations about the goods. UCC ยง 2-313 outlines how express warranties can be formed.\n   - **Implied Warranty**: Automatically arises under the UCC when goods are sold, particularly under UCC ยง 2-314 (implied warranty of merchantability) and ยง 2-315 (implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose).\n\n3. **Scope of Protection**:\n   - **Express Warranty**: The protection is specific to the claims made by the seller. If the goods do not meet the stated qualities, the buyer may have grounds for a breach of warranty claim.\n   - **Implied Warranty**: Provides a general assurance that the goods are of a certain quality and fit for ordinary use. It protects consumers even if the seller did not make specific claims about the product.\n\n4. **Disclaimers**:\n   - **Express Warranty**: Sellers can disclaim express warranties, but this must be done clearly and explicitly.\n   - **Implied Warranty**: The UCC allows sellers to disclaim implied warranties, but such disclaimers must also be clear and conspicuous.\n\n5. **Legal Framework**:\n   - Both types of warranties are governed by Article 2 of the UCC, which standardizes commercial transactions across the United States, ensuring that consumers have certain rights when purchasing goods.\n\nIn summary, express warranties are specific promises made by the seller, while implied warranties are automatically assumed protections that apply to the sale of goods. Understanding these differences is crucial for both consumers and sellers in navigating commercial transactions.
