    What qualifications are necessary for membership in the Rajya Sabha?
answer: >-
    To be eligible for membership in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, an individual must meet the qualifications outlined in Article 84 of the Indian Constitution. These qualifications are as follows:\n\n1. **Citizenship**: The individual must be a citizen of India.\n2. **Age**: The individual must be at least 30 years old. This is in contrast to the Lok Sabha, where the minimum age requirement is 25 years.\n3. **Oath or Affirmation**: The individual must take an oath or affirmation in front of an authorized person from the Election Commission, as described in the Third Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nAdditionally, the Representation of the People Act of 1951 may prescribe further qualifications or disqualifications for members of the Rajya Sabha. \n\nIt is important to note that the Rajya Sabha is not subject to dissolution like the Lok Sabha; instead, one-third of its members retire every two years, ensuring continuity within the house. The maximum membership of the Rajya Sabha is 250, with 238 members elected by the state and territorial legislatures, and 12 members nominated by the President of India for their expertise in specific fields such as literature, science, art, and social service. \n\nThese qualifications ensure that members of the Rajya Sabha are experienced and capable individuals who can contribute effectively to the legislative process in India.
