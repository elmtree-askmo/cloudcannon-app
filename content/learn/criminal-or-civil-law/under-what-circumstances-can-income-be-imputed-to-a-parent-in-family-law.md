    Under what circumstances can income be imputed to a parent in family law?
answer: >-
    In family law, income can be imputed to a parent under specific circumstances, primarily when the court determines that the parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. Here are the key scenarios where income imputation may occur:\n\n1. **Voluntary Unemployment**: If a parent chooses not to work or has left a job without a valid reason, the court may impute income based on their previous earnings or potential earning capacity. For instance, if a parent previously earned $80,000 annually but is currently not working, the court may assign an income level reflective of their past earnings.\n\n2. **Underemployment**: When a parent is working but earning significantly less than they are capable of, the court may impute income to reflect what they could earn if they were working in a position that matches their skills and experience. For example, if a parent has a history of earning $100,000 but is currently working part-time for $30,000, the court may impute income at the higher level to ensure fair child support obligations.\n\n3. **Failure to Seek Employment**: If a parent is not actively seeking employment or is not making reasonable efforts to find a job that matches their qualifications, the court may impute income. This can include situations where a parent has the ability to work but chooses not to engage in job searches.\n\n4. **Educational Background and Skills**: The court may consider a parent's education, work history, and skills when determining the appropriate level of imputed income. If a parent has a degree or specialized training, the court may expect them to earn a certain income level based on that background.\n\n5. **Economic Conditions**: In some cases, the court may also take into account the current job market and economic conditions when deciding on imputed income. If there are ample job opportunities in the parent's field, the court may be more likely to impute income.\n\nOverall, the imputation of income is a tool used by courts to ensure that child support obligations are met fairly, reflecting a parent's earning potential rather than their actual income when that income is deemed insufficient or artificially low due to voluntary choices.
