    How is 'censure' defined and what is a common example of its use?
answer: >-
    The term 'censure' can function as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it refers to a strong expression of criticism or disapproval, particularly in an official or formal context. As a verb, it means to criticize someone very strongly. \n\nFor example, if a public official engages in misconduct, they may face censure from their peers or the public. A common usage of the word in a sentence is: "The country faces international censure for its alleged involvement in the assassination." This illustrates how censure often pertains to actions that are deemed unacceptable or unethical, especially in a political or public sphere.\n\nIn summary, 'censure' denotes a formal reprimand or strong disapproval, often associated with public figures or policies.
