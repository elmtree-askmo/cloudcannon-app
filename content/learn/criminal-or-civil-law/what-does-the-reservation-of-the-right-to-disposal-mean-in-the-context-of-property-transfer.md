    What does the 'reservation of the right to disposal' mean in the context of property transfer?
answer: >-
    In the context of property transfer, the "reservation of the right to disposal" refers to a provision in a sales contract that allows the seller to retain ownership of the goods until certain specified conditions are fulfilled, typically the payment of the purchase price. This means that even if the buyer takes possession of the goods, the legal ownership remains with the seller until the agreed conditions are met.\n\nAccording to Section 25 of the Sale of Goods Act, when there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, the seller may explicitly reserve the right of disposal. This reservation can be crucial in protecting the seller's interests, especially in credit transactions, as it ensures that the seller retains control over the goods until they receive full payment. The right of disposal can be either explicitly stated in the contract or implied based on the circumstances surrounding the sale.\n\nIn summary, the reservation of the right to disposal is a mechanism that allows sellers to manage the transfer of ownership and mitigate risks associated with non-payment, ensuring that they have recourse to the goods until they are compensated as per the terms of the contract.
