    What types of specialist courts exist in Singapore, and what are their functions?
answer: >-
    In Singapore, specialist courts are designed to handle specific types of cases, providing tailored processes and expertise to resolve disputes efficiently. The main types of specialist courts include:\n\n1. **Family Justice Courts**: These courts focus on family-related matters, including divorce, child custody, and maintenance issues. They aim to provide a supportive environment for families and children involved in legal disputes, emphasizing mediation and alternative dispute resolution where possible.\n\n2. **Employment Claims Tribunals**: This tribunal addresses disputes between employers and employees regarding employment claims, such as wrongful dismissal, salary disputes, and other employment-related issues. The tribunal aims to provide a quicker and more accessible resolution process for employment disputes.\n\n3. **Small Claims Tribunals**: These tribunals handle minor civil disputes involving claims up to a specified monetary limit (currently set at $20,000). The Small Claims Tribunals are designed to provide a simple and informal process for individuals to resolve disputes without the need for legal representation.\n\n4. **Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals**: These tribunals deal with disputes arising from community living, such as noise complaints and other neighborhood issues. They aim to promote harmony and understanding among community members.\n\n5. **Employment Claims Tribunals**: This tribunal specifically addresses disputes related to employment matters, providing a platform for employees to claim against their employers for issues such as unpaid wages or wrongful dismissal.\n\nThese specialist courts and tribunals play a crucial role in the judicial system of Singapore by ensuring that specific types of disputes are handled by judges and adjudicators with relevant expertise, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal process.
