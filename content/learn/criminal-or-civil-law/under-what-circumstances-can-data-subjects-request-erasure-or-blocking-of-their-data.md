    Under what circumstances can data subjects request erasure or blocking of their data?
answer: >-
    Data subjects in the Philippines have the right to request the erasure or blocking of their personal data under specific circumstances as outlined in the Data Privacy Act (DPA). These circumstances include:\n\n1. **Incomplete, Outdated, False, or Unlawfully Obtained Data**: If the personal data held by a personal information controller (PIC) is incomplete, outdated, false, or was obtained unlawfully, the data subject can request its erasure or blocking.\n\n2. **Unauthorized Use**: If the personal data is being used for purposes that were not authorized by the data subject, they have the right to request that it be erased or blocked.\n\n3. **Unlawful Processing**: If the processing of personal data is deemed unlawful, the data subject can request its removal or blocking.\n\n4. **Data No Longer Necessary**: If the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, the data subject can also request its erasure.\n\n5. **Publicly Available Data**: Data subjects can request the erasure of their personal data that is publicly available, such as information found online. The PIC is then required to communicate with other PICs and third-party indexes to ensure that copies or links to the data are also removed.\n\nIt is important to note that while data subjects have these rights, the requests for erasure or blocking must be supported by substantial proof, and there are specific instances where such requests may be denied. The DPA emphasizes the need for PICs to comply with these requests when they are based on unlawful processing or unauthorized use of personal data.
