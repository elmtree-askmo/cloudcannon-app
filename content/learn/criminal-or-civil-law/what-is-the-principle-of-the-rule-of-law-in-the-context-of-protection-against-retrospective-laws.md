    What is the principle of the rule of law in the context of protection against retrospective laws?
answer: >-
    The principle of the rule of law is fundamentally intertwined with the protection against retrospective laws, particularly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Constitution of Singapore. This article explicitly states that no individual can be punished for an act that was not an offense at the time it was committed. This provision is crucial in upholding the rule of law, which asserts that all individuals and institutions are subject to the law, and that laws must be applied equally and fairly.\n\nThe protection against retrospective laws serves several important functions within the framework of the rule of law:\n\n1. **Prevention of Arbitrary Punishment**: By prohibiting retrospective laws, the legal system ensures that individuals are not subjected to arbitrary punishment for actions that were legal at the time they were performed. This is essential for maintaining justice and fairness in the legal system.\n\n2. **Legal Certainty**: The rule of law requires that laws be clear, stable, and accessible. When laws are not applied retrospectively, individuals can have confidence in the legal framework, knowing that they will not be penalized for past actions that were permissible. This certainty is vital for individuals to plan their actions without fear of future legal repercussions.\n\n3. **Equality Before the Law**: The principle of equality before the law, a key aspect of the rule of law, is reinforced by the prohibition of retrospective laws. It ensures that all individuals are treated equally under the law, and that no one can be punished for actions that were not deemed illegal at the time they were committed.\n\n4. **Protection of Individual Rights**: The rule of law is essential for protecting individual rights and freedoms. By safeguarding against retrospective laws, the legal system upholds the rights of individuals, ensuring that they are not unfairly targeted or punished based on changes in the law.\n\nIn summary, the principle of the rule of law, as it relates to the protection against retrospective laws, is vital for ensuring justice, legal certainty, equality, and the protection of individual rights within the legal framework of Singapore. This principle helps to maintain public trust in the legal system and prevents the misuse of legislative power.
