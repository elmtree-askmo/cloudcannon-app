answer: >-
    Under Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal government of Canada is granted a variety of powers that are primarily concerned with matters of national interest. These powers include, but are not limited to, the following key areas:\n\n1. **Public Debt and Property**: The federal government has the authority to manage national debt and federal properties.\n\n2. **Defense**: It is responsible for national defense, including the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\n3. **Trade and Commerce**: The federal government regulates trade and commerce between provinces and with other countries, ensuring a unified economic framework.\n\n4. **Immigration and Naturalization**: The federal government oversees immigration policies and the process of naturalization for new citizens.\n\n5. **Criminal Law**: The federal government has the exclusive power to enact criminal laws, which includes defining offenses and establishing penalties.\n\n6. **Banking and Currency**: The federal government regulates banking and issues currency, ensuring a stable financial system.\n\n7. **Postal Service**: It has the authority to establish and maintain a postal service across the country.\n\n8. **Indigenous Affairs**: The federal government is responsible for matters related to Indigenous peoples, including treaties and rights.\n\n9. **Patents and Copyrights**: It regulates intellectual property rights, including patents and copyrights.\n\n10. **Interprovincial and International Trade**: The federal government has the power to regulate trade and commerce that crosses provincial and international borders.\n\nThese powers are designed to ensure that the federal government can effectively manage issues that affect the entire country, while provincial governments retain powers over local matters as outlined in Section 92 of the same Act. The division of powers between federal and provincial governments is a fundamental aspect of Canada's federal structure, allowing for a balance of authority and responsibility.
