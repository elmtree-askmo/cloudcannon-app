    What are the common methods of data and system interference in cybercrimes?
answer: >-
    Common methods of data and system interference in cybercrimes include several illegal activities that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. Here are the primary methods:\n\n1. **Illegal Access (Hacking)**: Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, often to steal or manipulate data.\n\n2. **Illegal Data Acquisition (Data Espionage)**: Gaining unauthorized access to confidential data for malicious purposes, such as corporate espionage.\n\n3. **Illegal Interception**: Capturing data as it is transmitted over networks, which can include eavesdropping on communications.\n\n4. **Data Interference**: This involves actions that delete, damage, impair, alter, or suppress computer data. It can also render data inaccessible, which may include installing malicious software that facilitates further illegal activities, such as data theft.\n\n5. **System Interference**: Disrupting the normal functioning of a computer system, which can include deploying malware that affects system performance or availability.\n\n6. **Ransomware Attacks**: A specific type of system interference where hackers lock systems and demand a ransom for access restoration.\n\nThese methods are categorized under offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computerized data and systems, as recognized in various legal frameworks, including the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 in the Philippines. This act outlines specific prohibited acts, including illegal access, data interference, and system interference, thereby establishing a legal basis for prosecuting such cybercrimes.
