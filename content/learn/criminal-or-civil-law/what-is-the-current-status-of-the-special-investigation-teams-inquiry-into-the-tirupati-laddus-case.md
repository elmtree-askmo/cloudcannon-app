    What is the current status of the Special Investigation Team's inquiry into the Tirupati Laddus case?
answer: >-
    The current status of the Special Investigation Team's (SIT) inquiry into the Tirupati Laddus case is that the SIT has been constituted following a Supreme Court directive to investigate allegations regarding the use of animal fat in the preparation of the laddus at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple. This five-member SIT includes officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Andhra Pradesh Police, and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).\n\nThe SIT has commenced its investigation into the claims of using adulterated ghee for making the laddu prasad, particularly during the previous YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) regime. However, it is important to note that the investigation by the SIT may be affected by the ongoing legal proceedings, as the matter is currently sub-judice in the Supreme Court. The court has raised questions regarding the validity of the claims made by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu about the use of adulterated ghee, emphasizing the need for evidence to support such allegations.\n\nIn summary, while the SIT has started its probe, the investigation's progress may be influenced by the Supreme Court's oversight and the legal context surrounding the case.
