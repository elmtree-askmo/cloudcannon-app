    What are the main provisions of the Surrogacy Act, 2021?
answer: >-
    The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 is a significant piece of legislation passed by the Indian Parliament to regulate surrogacy practices in India. It received the President's assent on December 25, 2021, and aims to create a structured and ethical framework for surrogacy, addressing concerns related to exploitation and ensuring the rights of all parties involved.\n\n### Main Provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:\n\n1. **Definition of Surrogacy**: The Act defines surrogacy and establishes the legal framework for its practice in India. It specifies the conditions under which surrogacy can occur.\n\n2. **Prohibition of Commercial Surrogacy**: The Act prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. This means that surrogates cannot receive financial compensation beyond medical expenses and insurance coverage.\n\n3. **Establishment of Regulatory Bodies**: The Act provides for the establishment of the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board, as well as State Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Boards. These bodies are responsible for overseeing and regulating surrogacy practices.\n\n4. **Registration of Clinics**: All clinics that provide surrogacy services must be registered under the Act. This ensures that they meet specific criteria and standards for operation.\n\n5. **Eligibility Criteria**: The Act outlines eligibility criteria for intended parents and surrogates. For instance, intended parents must be Indian citizens and married for at least five years, while surrogates must be married and have at least one child of their own.\n\n6. **Rights of Surrogates**: The Act emphasizes the rights of surrogates, ensuring that they are not exploited and that their health and well-being are prioritized throughout the surrogacy process.\n\n7. **Penalties for Violations**: The Act includes provisions for penalties and punishments for those who contravene its regulations, particularly concerning the practice of commercial surrogacy.\n\n8. **Legal Framework for Surrogacy Agreements**: The Act provides a legal framework for surrogacy agreements, ensuring that they are clear and enforceable, thus protecting the interests of all parties involved.\n\n9. **Medical and Psychological Support**: The Act mandates that surrogates receive adequate medical and psychological support during and after the surrogacy process.\n\nThe Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 represents a crucial step towards regulating surrogacy in India, aiming to protect the rights of surrogates and intended parents while preventing exploitation in the surrogacy industry.
