    What are the main objections of the Attorney General to the 'Ratings' Law?
answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information does not provide specific details regarding the objections of the Attorney General to the 'Ratings' Law. It primarily discusses general legal principles, media regulation, and some context about political figures, but lacks direct references to the Attorney General's stance on the 'Ratings' Law itself. If you have more specific information or context regarding the 'Ratings' Law, I would be happy to help analyze that.
