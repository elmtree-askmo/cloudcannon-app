    What are the key registers and documents that need to be maintained under the Companies Act 2013?
answer: >-
    Under the Companies Act, 2013, companies in India are required to maintain several key statutory registers and documents at their registered offices to ensure compliance and transparency. The following are the primary registers and documents mandated by the Act:\n\n1. **Incorporation Documents**: These include all documents and information originally filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) for the incorporation of the company. These documents must be preserved permanently until the dissolution of the company.\n\n2. **Memorandum of Association (MOA)**: This document outlines the company's objectives, scope of activities, and the powers of the company.\n\n3. **Articles of Association (AOA)**: This document contains the rules and regulations governing the internal management of the company.\n\n4. **Register of Members**: This register includes details of all members of the company, such as their names, addresses, and the number of shares held. It must be updated whenever there are changes in membership.\n\n5. **Register of Directors and Key Managerial Personnel**: This register contains information about the directors and key managerial personnel, including their shareholding in the company.\n\n6. **Register of Charges**: This register records all charges created by the company on its assets. It must be updated with relevant forms filed with the RoC.\n\n7. **Register of Significant Beneficial Owners**: This register is required to identify individuals who ultimately own or control the company, ensuring transparency in ownership.\n\n8. **Minutes of Meetings**: Companies must maintain minutes of all meetings, including board meetings and general meetings, to document decisions made and discussions held.\n\n9. **Other Registers**: Depending on the nature of the company, additional registers may be required, such as the register of sweat equity shares and employee stock options.\n\nFailure to maintain these statutory registers can result in penalties, with fines ranging from ₹1 lakh to ₹10 lakh. It is essential for companies to keep these records up to date and in a systematic manner to comply with the legal requirements set forth in the Companies Act, 2013.
