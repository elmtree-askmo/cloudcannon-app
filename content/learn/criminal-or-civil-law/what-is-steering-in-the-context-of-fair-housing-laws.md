    What is steering in the context of fair housing laws?
answer: >-
    In the context of fair housing laws, "steering" refers to the unethical and illegal practice of influencing a buyer's or renter's choice of communities based on one of the protected characteristics outlined in the Fair Housing Act. These protected characteristics include race, color, religion, gender, disability, familial status, and national origin.\n\nSteering occurs when real estate agents or other housing providers guide clients toward or away from certain neighborhoods or properties based on these characteristics. For example, a real estate agent might only show properties in neighborhoods predominantly occupied by individuals of the same race as the buyer, while avoiding areas where they believe the buyer may not feel comfortable due to their race or other protected factors. This practice not only limits the housing options available to individuals but also perpetuates segregation and discrimination in housing.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act, enacted in 1968, prohibits such discriminatory practices, and violations can lead to legal consequences. Individuals who believe they have been subjected to steering can file a private lawsuit, submit an administrative complaint to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or seek assistance from state or local fair housing agencies. \n\nIn summary, steering is a form of discrimination that undermines the principles of fair housing and equal opportunity, and it is actively prohibited by law.
