    In Sessions 7-10 on equal protection, the topics covered likely include a range of critical issues related to the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, focusing on its application in various contexts, including gender discrimination, immigration, and broader civil rights issues. Here are some key themes that may be discussed:\n\n1. **Historical Context and Evolution**: The sessions may explore the historical development of the Equal Protection Clause, particularly its origins in the aftermath of the Civil War and its implications for formerly enslaved individuals. This includes examining landmark cases that have shaped its interpretation over time.\n\n2. **Key Supreme Court Cases**: Important Supreme Court decisions, such as *Sessions v. Morales-Santana* (2017), which invalidated a citizenship statute that discriminated based on gender, are likely to be analyzed. This case is significant as it marked a pivotal moment in applying equal protection principles to immigration law, emphasizing the Court's role in addressing gender-based discrimination.\n\n3. **Legal Standards of Scrutiny**: The sessions may cover the different levels of scrutiny applied in equal protection cases, such as strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Understanding these standards is crucial for analyzing how courts evaluate laws that classify individuals based on race, gender, or other characteristics.\n\n4. **Contemporary Issues**: Discussions may also include current debates surrounding equal protection, such as those related to reproductive rights, affirmative action, and the rights of marginalized groups. This could involve examining how the Equal Protection Clause is invoked in contemporary legal battles and social justice movements.\n\n5. **Intersectionality and Social Justice**: The sessions might address the intersection of various forms of discrimination and how the Equal Protection Clause can be a tool for advocating for social justice. This includes exploring how different identities (race, gender, sexual orientation) interact and the implications for legal protections.\n\nOverall, Sessions 7-10 would provide a comprehensive examination of equal protection, emphasizing its historical roots, legal interpretations, and ongoing relevance in contemporary society.
