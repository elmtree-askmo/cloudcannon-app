    What are specific liens and how do they affect property?
answer: >-
    A specific lien is a legal claim that attaches to a particular asset, as opposed to a general lien, which applies to all of a debtor's property. Specific liens are often used as collateral for the repayment of a debt or obligation that arises from a transaction or agreement related to the specified property. For example, when a mortgage is taken out to finance the purchase of real estate, the lender holds a specific lien on that property. This means that if the borrower fails to make the required payments, the lender has the right to foreclose on the property to recover the owed amount.\n\nSpecific liens can be voluntary or involuntary. A voluntary specific lien is created through an agreement between the debtor and creditor, such as a mortgage. In contrast, an involuntary specific lien may arise from statutory obligations, such as a mechanic's lien, which secures payment for services rendered on a specific property.\n\nThe presence of a specific lien can significantly affect property transactions. For instance, if a property has a specific lien attached to it, the lien must be resolved or cleared before the property can be sold or transferred to a new owner. This can complicate sales and may require the seller to pay off the debt associated with the lien before completing the transaction. Additionally, specific liens often appear on property deeds, which can alert potential buyers to existing financial obligations tied to the property.\n\nIn summary, specific liens are crucial in property transactions as they provide creditors with a legal claim to specific assets, ensuring that debts are repaid while also impacting the transferability and ownership of the property.
