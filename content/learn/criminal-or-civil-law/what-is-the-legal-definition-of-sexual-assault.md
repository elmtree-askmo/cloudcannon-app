    What is the legal definition of sexual assault?
answer: >-
    The legal definition of sexual assault generally refers to any nonconsensual sexual act that is prohibited by Federal, tribal, or State law. This includes situations where the victim lacks the capacity to consent, such as due to age, disability, or the influence of alcohol or drugs. Sexual assault encompasses a wide range of unwanted behaviors, which can include both contact and non-contact activities. For example, it can involve physical acts of sexual violence, such as rape, as well as non-contact offenses like exposing oneself or forcing someone to view sexual images.\n\nLegal definitions of sexual assault can vary slightly from state to state, but the core concept remains consistent: it is any sexual activity or contact that occurs without the consent of the victim. This includes acts that are attempted or completed against a victim's will. The prosecution must demonstrate the absence of consent to prove sexual assault, while the defendant may argue that consent was present to refute the allegations.\n\nIn summary, sexual assault is recognized as a serious crime that affects individuals and society at large, and it is defined by the lack of consent in any sexual act.
