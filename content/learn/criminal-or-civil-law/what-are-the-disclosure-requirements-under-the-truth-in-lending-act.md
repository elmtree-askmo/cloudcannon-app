    What are the disclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act?
answer: >-
    The Truth in Lending Act (TILA), enacted in 1968, mandates that lenders provide borrowers with clear and standardized information regarding the terms and costs associated with consumer credit. This is intended to promote transparency and enable consumers to make informed decisions when borrowing.\n\n### Disclosure Requirements Under the Truth in Lending Act\n\n1. **Loan Amount**: The total amount of credit extended to the borrower.\n\n2. **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The cost of credit expressed as a yearly interest rate, which includes both the interest rate and any associated fees.\n\n3. **Finance Charges**: The total cost of borrowing, including interest and any additional fees that may apply.\n\n4. **Payment Schedule**: Detailed information on the number of payments, the amount of each payment, and when they are due.\n\n5. **Total Amount Payable**: The total sum that the borrower will pay over the life of the loan, including principal, interest, and any fees.\n\n6. **Late Fees and Prepayment Penalties**: Information on any fees that may be charged for late payments and whether there are penalties for paying off the loan early.\n\n7. **Right of Rescission**: For certain types of home loans, borrowers are informed of their right to cancel the loan within a specified period.\n\n8. **Additional Terms**: Any other relevant terms and conditions that may affect the loan, such as variable interest rates or conditions under which the lender may change the terms.\n\nThese disclosures must be provided to borrowers before they sign any loan agreement, ensuring that they have the necessary information to understand the financial implications of their borrowing decisions. The TILA applies to various forms of consumer credit, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, and is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of 2011.\n\nBy standardizing the information that lenders must disclose, the TILA aims to protect consumers from deceptive lending practices and facilitate easier comparison of credit terms across different lenders.
