    How do landmark Supreme Court cases shape the interpretation of the First Amendment?
answer: >-
    Landmark Supreme Court cases have significantly shaped the interpretation of the First Amendment, particularly regarding the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. These cases have established precedents that define the boundaries of religious freedom and government involvement in religious matters.\n\n1. **Establishment Clause**: This clause prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or unduly favoring one religion over another. Cases like *Engel v. Vitale* (1962) ruled that school-sponsored prayer is unconstitutional, reinforcing the separation of church and state. Similarly, in *Stone v. Graham* (1980), the Court held that posting the Ten Commandments in public schools violated the Establishment Clause, as the primary purpose was religious.\n\n2. **Free Exercise Clause**: This clause protects individuals' rights to practice their religion freely. In *Wisconsin v. Yoder* (1972), the Court ruled that Amish children could not be compelled to attend school past the eighth grade, recognizing the importance of religious upbringing. Conversely, in *Reynolds v. United States* (1878), the Court upheld a law against polygamy, stating that religious beliefs do not exempt individuals from compliance with general laws.\n\n3. **Balancing Act**: The Supreme Court has often had to balance the rights protected under the Free Exercise Clause with the government's interest in maintaining a secular state. For instance, in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), the Court ruled that a high school football coach had the right to pray on the field after games, emphasizing the protection of individual religious expression in public spaces.\n\n4. **Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)**: Enacted in 1993, RFRA aims to prevent laws that substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court has interpreted this act in various cases, reinforcing the idea that the government must demonstrate a compelling interest when imposing restrictions on religious practices.\n\n5. **Recent Trends**: Recent decisions indicate a shift towards favoring religious expression, particularly for Christian plaintiffs. Critics argue that this trend may lead to religious favoritism rather than equal treatment for all faiths. For example, the Court's decisions have allowed for more government funding to religious schools under certain conditions, blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nIn summary, landmark Supreme Court cases have played a crucial role in interpreting the First Amendment, establishing a complex relationship between government and religion. These rulings continue to influence the legal landscape surrounding religious freedom and the role of faith in public life.
