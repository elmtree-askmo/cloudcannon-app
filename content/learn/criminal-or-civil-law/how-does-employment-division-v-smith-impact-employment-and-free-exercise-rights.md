    How does Employment Division v. Smith impact employment and free exercise rights?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court case Employment Division v. Smith, decided in 1990, significantly impacted employment and free exercise rights by altering the legal landscape regarding the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The case involved two members of the Native American Church who were denied unemployment benefits after being fired for using peyote, a substance illegal under Oregon law, during a religious ceremony.\n\nThe Court ruled that generally applicable laws that do not specifically target religious practices do not violate the Free Exercise Clause. This decision marked a departure from the previous standard, which required the government to demonstrate a compelling interest when a law substantially burdened religious practices. The ruling effectively stated that individuals could not use their religious beliefs as a justification to bypass neutral laws that apply to everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation.\n\nAs a result, Employment Division v. Smith has had profound implications for employment rights and religious freedom. It has made it more challenging for individuals to claim exemptions from generally applicable laws based on religious beliefs, particularly in employment contexts. This ruling has led to concerns about the potential for religious discrimination, as individuals may find themselves unable to practice their faith freely without facing employment repercussions or legal penalties.\n\nIn summary, Employment Division v. Smith established that the government could enforce neutral laws that may inadvertently affect religious practices, thereby limiting the scope of free exercise rights in the context of employment and other areas of public life.
