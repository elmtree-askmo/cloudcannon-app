    What role has the Indian government played in amending the RTI Act?
answer: >-
    The Indian government has played a significant role in amending the Right to Information (RTI) Act, particularly through the introduction of the Right to Information (Amendment) Act, 2019, and subsequent modifications in 2023.\n\n1. **Right to Information (Amendment) Act, 2019**: This amendment was introduced in the Lok Sabha on July 19, 2019, and passed on July 22, 2019. Key features of this amendment include:\n   - **Tenure and Salaries of Information Commissioners**: The amendment allows the central government to determine the tenure and salaries of the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) at both central and state levels. Previously, the RTI Act, 2005, stipulated that the term for the CIC and ICs was five years or until the age of 65, whichever came first. The amendment removed this provision, granting the government the authority to prescribe the term of office.\n   - **Impact on Autonomy**: Critics argue that this change could dilute the independence of the Information Commissions, potentially affecting their ability to operate without government influence. This has sparked significant debate regarding the implications for transparency and accountability in governance.\n\n2. **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**: More recently, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, has further modified the RTI Act. Specifically, it amended Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act to create an exemption for all personal information from disclosure. This change removes the previously established exceptions that allowed for the release of personal information if it served a larger public interest. Critics of this amendment express concern that it could limit the scope of the RTI Act and hinder transparency.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Political Parties**: The 2019 amendment also removed political parties from the definition of public authorities under the RTI Act, thereby exempting them from its purview. This change applies retrospectively from June 3, 2013, and has been met with criticism as it limits the accountability of political entities.\n\nOverall, the Indian government's amendments to the RTI Act have been controversial, with significant implications for transparency, accountability, and the autonomy of information commissions in India. The ongoing debates reflect the tension between governmental control and the public's right to information.
