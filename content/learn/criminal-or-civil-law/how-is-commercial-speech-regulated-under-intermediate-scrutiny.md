    How is commercial speech regulated under intermediate scrutiny?
answer: >-
    Commercial speech is regulated under intermediate scrutiny, a standard established by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York (1980). This case set forth a four-part test to determine the constitutionality of regulations on commercial speech, which is defined as speech that proposes a commercial transaction or relates solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\n\nThe four-part Central Hudson test is as follows:\n\n1. **Is the speech protected by the First Amendment?** The speech must concern lawful activity and not be misleading or fraudulent.\n2. **Does the government have a substantial interest in regulating the speech?** The government must demonstrate that its interest in regulation is significant.\n3. **Does the regulation directly advance the government’s interest?** The regulation must effectively further the government’s stated interest.\n4. **Is the regulation more extensive than necessary?** The regulation must not be overly broad; it should be narrowly tailored to achieve the government’s interest.\n\nUnder this framework, commercial speech receives less protection than political speech, which is subject to strict scrutiny. However, it is still afforded some level of protection, as the Supreme Court recognizes the importance of commercial speech in promoting economic interests and informing consumers.\n\nAdditionally, while commercial speech can be restricted, it can also be compelled. For instance, in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the Court held that states could require advertisers to disclose certain information without violating First Amendment rights, as long as the disclosure serves a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nOverall, the regulation of commercial speech is a nuanced area of First Amendment law, balancing the interests of free expression with the need for consumer protection and truthful advertising.
