    Who is responsible for delivery expenses in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    Under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the responsibility for delivery expenses primarily lies with the seller. According to Section 36(5) of the Act, the seller is responsible for all expenses related to preparing the goods for delivery unless the contract specifies otherwise. This means that if the goods are not in a deliverable state at the time of the contract, the seller must bear the costs associated with making them deliverable.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the contract can stipulate different arrangements regarding delivery expenses. For instance, if the contract explicitly states that the buyer will bear certain delivery costs, then the buyer would be responsible for those expenses. \n\nIn summary, unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, the seller is generally responsible for the expenses related to the delivery of goods.
