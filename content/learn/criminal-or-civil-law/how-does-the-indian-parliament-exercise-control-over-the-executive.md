    How does the Indian Parliament exercise control over the executive?
answer: >-
    The Indian Parliament exercises control over the executive through a variety of mechanisms that ensure accountability and transparency in governance. Here are the key ways in which this control is implemented:\n\n1. **Question Hour and Zero Hour**: During parliamentary sessions, the Question Hour allows members of Parliament (MPs) to ask questions to the ministers regarding their departments. This is a critical tool for holding the executive accountable. The Zero Hour follows the Question Hour, where MPs can raise urgent matters without prior notice, further enabling them to scrutinize the actions of the executive.\n\n2. **Motions and Debates**: Parliament can introduce various motions, such as adjournment motions and calling attention notices, which compel the government to respond to specific issues. These motions often lead to debates where the executive's policies and actions are critically examined.\n\n3. **Parliamentary Committees**: The committee system in Parliament plays a significant role in oversight. Committees can investigate specific issues, review government expenditures, and assess the implementation of laws. They provide a platform for detailed scrutiny of the executive's functioning.\n\n4. **Financial Control**: Parliament has significant financial powers, including the approval of the budget and expenditure. The government must present its financial proposals to Parliament, which can reject or modify them, thereby exercising control over the executive's financial decisions.\n\n5. **Ministerial Responsibility**: The principle of ministerial responsibility mandates that the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are accountable to Parliament. They must answer to Parliament for their actions and decisions, ensuring that the executive remains answerable to the elected representatives of the people.\n\n6. **Legislative Oversight**: Parliament has the authority to legislate and can pass laws that regulate the functioning of the executive. This legislative power allows Parliament to set the framework within which the executive operates.\n\n7. **Anti-Defection Law**: This law helps maintain stability within the legislature by preventing elected members from switching parties, thereby ensuring that the executive remains accountable to the party that holds the majority in Parliament.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, the Indian Parliament maintains a robust system of checks and balances, ensuring that the executive is held accountable for its actions and policies, which is essential for the functioning of a democratic government.
