    What is the difference between substantive law and procedural law?
answer: >-
    The difference between substantive law and procedural law is fundamental in the legal system, as they serve distinct purposes.\n\n**Substantive Law**:\n- Substantive law defines the rights and duties of individuals and governs specific areas of law. It encompasses the principles that determine how people should behave and what their rights are in various situations. For example, contract law is a substantive area of law that outlines the elements necessary for the formation, performance, and discharge of contracts. It dictates what constitutes a valid contract, the obligations of the parties involved, and the remedies available in case of a breach.\n\n**Procedural Law**:\n- Procedural law, on the other hand, outlines the processes and procedures for enforcing those rights and duties in legal proceedings. It provides the framework for how a lawsuit is initiated, conducted, and resolved. For instance, procedural law specifies the steps a plaintiff must take to file a lawsuit, the rules of evidence, and the conduct of trials. It ensures that legal proceedings are carried out fairly and consistently.\n\nIn summary, while substantive law focuses on the content of the law and the rights and obligations it creates, procedural law focuses on the methods and processes used to enforce those rights and obligations in a court of law.
