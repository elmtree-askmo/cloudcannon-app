    What are the main features of the EU's first law on violence against women?
answer: >-
    The European Union has recently enacted its first comprehensive law aimed at combating violence against women and domestic violence. This landmark legislation introduces several key features designed to address and mitigate these serious issues across EU member states. Here are the main features of the law:\n\n1. **Criminalization of Specific Offenses**: The law mandates that all EU countries criminalize various forms of violence against women, including:\n   - Female genital mutilation\n   - Forced marriage\n   - Online harassment, which encompasses cyber-stalking and cyber-flashing\n\n2. **Minimum Standards for Definitions and Penalties**: The legislation establishes minimum rules regarding the definitions of specific criminal offenses related to violence against women and the corresponding penalties. This uniformity aims to ensure that victims receive consistent legal protection across the EU.\n\n3. **Victim Rights**: The law outlines the rights of victims of all forms of violence against women. This includes access to justice, protection, and support services, ensuring that victims are treated with dignity and respect throughout the legal process.\n\n4. **Focus on Gender-Based Violence**: The directive emphasizes the need to combat gender-based violence, recognizing that such violence affects a significant portion of the populationâ€”approximately one in three women in the EU.\n\n5. **Implementation Timeline**: Member States are required to transpose the new directive (Directive 2024/1385) into their national laws by June 14, 2027. This timeline allows countries to adapt their legal frameworks to comply with the new standards.\n\n6. **Support for Victims**: The legislation is part of a broader EU Gender Equality Strategy (2020-2025), which aims to prevent and combat gender-based violence, support victims, and hold perpetrators accountable.\n\n7. **Decisive Action Against Violence**: The law reflects the EU's commitment to uphold fundamental rights and equality between women and men, taking decisive action to address and reduce instances of violence against women.\n\nThis legislation marks a significant step forward in the EU's efforts to create a safer environment for women and to combat the pervasive issue of violence against women across member states.
