    How is substantive due process defined in the context of U.S. law?
answer: >-
    Substantive due process is a principle in United States constitutional law that protects certain fundamental rights from government interference, even if those rights are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. This principle is derived from the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which state that no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."\n\nThe concept of substantive due process emerged as a way for courts to evaluate the fairness and justice of laws themselves, rather than just the procedures by which they are enforced. It allows courts to strike down laws that infringe upon fundamental rights, asserting that certain rights are so essential that they warrant protection from government action, regardless of the legal processes involved.\n\nHistorically, the Supreme Court's engagement with substantive due process began during the Lochner Era, particularly in the case of *Lochner v. New York* (1905). In this landmark decision, the Court ruled that a New York law regulating bakers' working hours was unconstitutional, emphasizing the bakers' substantive due process right to work under their own terms.\n\nOver time, the doctrine has evolved, with the Court recognizing various rights under substantive due process, including the right to privacy. However, the interpretation of these rights has been subject to change, as evidenced by recent rulings, such as the 2022 decision that indicated a potential retreat from recognizing certain noneconomic substantive due process rights, specifically regarding the right to abortion.\n\nIn summary, substantive due process serves as a critical mechanism for safeguarding fundamental rights against government overreach, ensuring that laws themselves are just and equitable.
