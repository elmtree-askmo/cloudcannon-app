    Which areas in Manipur are affected by the AFSPA extension?
answer: >-
    The extension of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in Manipur affects various areas within the state, particularly focusing on regions experiencing ethnic violence. As of October 1, 2023, AFSPA has been extended for six months in all parts of Manipur, except for 19 police station areas located in the Imphal valley. These excluded areas include Imphal, Bishnupur, Jiribam, and Lamphel.\n\nThe decision to extend AFSPA was made in response to ongoing security concerns and ethnic violence, particularly between the Meitei and Kuki communities. The areas specifically affected by the extension of AFSPA include six police station areas that have been classified as "disturbed" due to the volatile situation. These areas are Sekmai, Lamsang, Lamlai, Moirang, Leimakhong, and Jiribam.\n\nOverall, while the majority of Manipur remains under the provisions of AFSPA, the Imphal valley and certain police station jurisdictions are excluded from this designation, reflecting the government's attempt to balance security needs with local governance.
