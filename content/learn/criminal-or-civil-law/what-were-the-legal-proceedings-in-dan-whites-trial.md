    What were the legal proceedings in Dan White's trial?
answer: >-
    The legal proceedings in Dan White's trial were significant and highly publicized, reflecting the intense socio-political climate of San Francisco in the late 1970s. The trial began on May 1, 1979, and was presided over by Judge Walter F. Calcagno. White was charged with the murders of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, both of whom he shot on November 27, 1978.\n\nThe prosecution, led by Thomas F. Norman, presented a case that characterized the killings as a deliberate act of malice. They argued that White had premeditated the murders, which amounted to a double execution. In contrast, the defense, represented by attorneys Douglas Schmidt and Stephen Scherr, employed what became known as the "Twinkie defense." This defense argued that White was suffering from diminished capacity due to severe depression and a poor diet, which included an excessive intake of junk food, leading to a state where he could not premeditate the murders.\n\nThroughout the trial, the defense called several psychiatrists to testify about White's mental state, asserting that he was so depressed and sleep-deprived that he lacked the capacity to form the intent necessary for a first-degree murder conviction. This argument was controversial and drew significant media attention.\n\nAfter 36 hours of jury deliberation, the verdict was announced on May 21, 1979. The jury found Dan White not guilty of first-degree murder but guilty of two counts of voluntary manslaughter. He was subsequently sentenced to a maximum term of 7 years and 8 months in prison. This lenient sentence sparked outrage and protests, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community and the Castro district, culminating in the White Night riots.\n\nThe trial and its outcome had a lasting impact on the LGBTQ+ rights movement and highlighted the political tensions in San Francisco at the time, as well as the challenges faced by the community in the wake of the assassinations.
