    What are the current mandatory reporting guidelines for child protection in Toronto?
answer: >-
    In Toronto, the current mandatory reporting guidelines for child protection are governed by Section 125 of the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, 2017 (CYFSA). According to this legislation, it is a legal requirement for members of the public, including professionals who work with children, to promptly report any suspicions that a child under the age of 16 is, or may be, in need of protection to a Children's Aid Society (CAS).\n\nKey points regarding the mandatory reporting guidelines include:\n\n1. **Mandatory Reporting for Children Under 16**: Individuals must report any suspicions of child abuse or neglect concerning children under 16 years of age. This includes any reasonable suspicion that a child may be in need of protection.\n\n2. **Reporting for Youth Aged 16 and 17**: While the age of protection was raised to include youth up to 18 years old, reporting for those aged 16 and 17 is not mandatory. However, if there are concerns about a 16- or 17-year-old being in need of protection, individuals are encouraged to contact their local Children's Aid Society, which is required to assess the reported information.\n\n3. **No Delegation of Reporting**: Individuals cannot delegate their responsibility to report; they must make the report themselves.\n\nThese guidelines are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of children and youth in Ontario, and they emphasize the importance of vigilance and prompt action in cases of suspected abuse or neglect.
