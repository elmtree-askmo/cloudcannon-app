    What amendments have been suggested for the POSH Act?
answer: >-
    The proposed amendments to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (commonly known as the POSH Act) were introduced in a Bill before the Rajya Sabha on February 2, 2024. The key amendments suggested in the Amendment Bill 2024 focus on two main areas:\n\n1. **Timeline for Filing Complaints**: The current provision allows complainants to file a complaint within three months from the date of the incident. The proposed amendment seeks to extend this timeline to one year, providing victims with more time to come forward.\n\n2. **Conciliation Process**: The Amendment Bill proposes the elimination of the conciliation process, which is currently part of the complaint resolution mechanism. This change aims to streamline the process and ensure that complaints are addressed more directly and effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the Bill suggests substituting Section 13(4) of the POSH Act, indicating that the employer or the District Judge shall act upon the directions of the Employment Tribunal. This aligns with recommendations from the J.S. Verma Committee, which emphasized the establishment of an Employment Tribunal to handle such cases.\n\nThese amendments are part of ongoing efforts to enhance the efficacy of the POSH Act and address existing loopholes in the law, ensuring better protection for women in the workplace against sexual harassment.
