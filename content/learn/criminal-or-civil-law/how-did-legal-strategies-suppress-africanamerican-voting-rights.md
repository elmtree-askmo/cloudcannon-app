    How did legal strategies suppress African-American voting rights?
answer: >-
    Legal strategies to suppress African-American voting rights emerged prominently after the Civil War, particularly during the Reconstruction Era and continued into the Jim Crow period. These strategies were designed to circumvent the protections afforded by the 15th Amendment, which was ratified in 1870 to guarantee African American men the right to vote. However, many Southern states implemented various discriminatory laws and practices that effectively disenfranchised Black voters.\n\n1. **Grandfather Clauses**: This legal mechanism allowed individuals to bypass literacy tests and poll taxes if their grandfathers had been eligible to vote before the Civil War. This effectively exempted many white voters from these requirements while disenfranchising African Americans, whose ancestors had been enslaved and thus could not vote prior to 1867.\n\n2. **Literacy Tests**: These tests were ostensibly designed to ensure that voters could read and write, but in practice, they were often applied subjectively and discriminatorily. Many African Americans were subjected to rigorous and confusing tests, while white voters were often exempted or given easier tests, if they were tested at all.\n\n3. **Poll Taxes**: Southern states imposed fees that voters had to pay in order to cast a ballot. This disproportionately affected African Americans and poor whites, effectively limiting their ability to participate in elections. The requirement to pay a tax to vote was a significant barrier, especially for those who were economically disadvantaged.\n\n4. **Intimidation and Violence**: Beyond legal measures, extralegal strategies such as intimidation, threats, and violence were employed to suppress African American voting. Organizations like the Ku Klux Klan used terror tactics to discourage Black citizens from voting or even registering to vote.\n\n5. **Voter Registration Restrictions**: States implemented various bureaucratic hurdles that made it difficult for African Americans to register. This included requiring documentation that many Black citizens did not possess, or imposing arbitrary deadlines and requirements that were not enforced uniformly.\n\nThese legal strategies were part of a broader effort by Southern Democrats to regain control over state legislatures and maintain white supremacy in the political system. The culmination of these efforts led to widespread disenfranchisement of African Americans until the civil rights movement and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which aimed to eliminate these discriminatory practices and protect the voting rights of all citizens.
