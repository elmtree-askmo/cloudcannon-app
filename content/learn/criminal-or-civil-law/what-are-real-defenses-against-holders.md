    What are real defenses against holders?
answer: >-
    Real defenses, also known as universal defenses, are those that can be asserted against any holder of a negotiable instrument, including holders in due course (HDCs). These defenses are significant because they provide a means for obligors to contest their liability on an instrument, regardless of the holder's status. The primary real defenses include:\n\n1. **Forgery or Fraud in the Execution**: If a signature on the instrument is forged or if the instrument was executed under fraudulent circumstances, this defense is valid against all holders.\n\n2. **Material Alteration**: If the terms of the instrument have been materially altered without the consent of the obligor, this can serve as a defense. Material alterations change the rights and obligations of the parties involved.\n\n3. **Discharge in Bankruptcy**: If the obligor has been discharged from their debts through bankruptcy proceedings, they can assert this as a defense against claims on the negotiable instrument.\n\n4. **Minority**: Contracts entered into by minors are generally voidable. If a minor signs a negotiable instrument, they may assert their minority status as a defense.\n\n5. **Illegality**: If the underlying transaction is illegal, the obligor can use this as a defense against enforcement of the instrument.\n\n6. **Mental Incapacity**: If the obligor was mentally incapacitated at the time of signing the instrument, this can be a valid defense.\n\n7. **Extreme Duress**: If the obligor was forced to sign the instrument under extreme duress, they can assert this as a defense.\n\nThese defenses are crucial in commercial law as they protect individuals from being held liable for obligations that are fundamentally flawed or unjust. Understanding these defenses is essential for both holders and obligors in the context of negotiable instruments.
