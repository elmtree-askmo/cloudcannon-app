answer: >-
    Section 20 of The Sale of Goods Act, 1930, specifically addresses the passing of property in ascertained goods that are in a deliverable state. The key provisions of this section are as follows:\n\n1. **Unconditional Contract**: Section 20 applies when there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods. This means that the contract does not have any conditions that need to be fulfilled before the transfer of ownership can occur.\n\n2. **Deliverable State**: The goods must be in a deliverable state at the time the contract is made. A deliverable state refers to the condition of the goods being ready for delivery to the buyer without any further action required by the seller.\n\n3. **Time of Transfer**: The property in the goods passes to the buyer at the moment the contract is made. This transfer of ownership occurs regardless of the timing of payment or delivery. In other words, it is immaterial whether the buyer has paid for the goods or whether the goods have been physically delivered at that time.\n\n4. **Implications**: This provision emphasizes that once the contract is established under the specified conditions, the buyer assumes ownership of the goods, which can have significant implications for both parties, particularly in terms of risk and liability.\n\nIn summary, Section 20 establishes that for specific goods in a deliverable state, ownership transfers to the buyer at the time of contract formation, independent of payment or delivery timing. This provision is crucial for understanding the rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers in commercial transactions involving ascertained goods.
