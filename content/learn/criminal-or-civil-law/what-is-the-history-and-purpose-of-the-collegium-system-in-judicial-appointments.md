    What is the history and purpose of the Collegium System in judicial appointments?
answer: >-
    The Collegium System in India is a mechanism for the appointment and transfer of judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts. Its origins can be traced back to a series of landmark Supreme Court judgments known as the "Three Judges Cases," which established the framework for judicial appointments without any explicit mention in the Constitution of India.\n\n### History of the Collegium System\n\n1. **Initial Development**: The Collegium System emerged from the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution, particularly through the judgments in the Second Judges Case (1993) and the Third Judges Case (1998). These rulings emphasized the "primacy" of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in judicial appointments, asserting that the executive's role should be limited to consultation rather than decision-making.\n\n2. **Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC)**: In 2013, the Indian Parliament passed the Constitution (120th Amendment) Bill, which aimed to establish a Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) to recommend appointments to the higher judiciary. However, this amendment was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, reaffirming the Collegium System as the constitutional method for judicial appointments.\n\n3. **Current Structure**: Under the Collegium System, the CJI, along with the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, recommends appointments and transfers of judges. For High Courts, the Collegium consists of the CJI and the two senior-most judges. This system is designed to ensure that the judiciary maintains control over its own appointments, thereby safeguarding its independence.\n\n### Purpose of the Collegium System\n\nThe primary purpose of the Collegium System is to uphold the independence of the judiciary by allowing judges to appoint their successors. This is intended to prevent political interference in judicial appointments and to ensure that only qualified and competent individuals are appointed to the higher judiciary. The system aims to maintain a balance of power between the judiciary and the executive, ensuring that judicial appointments are made based on merit rather than political considerations.\n\n### Criticisms and Challenges\n\nDespite its intentions, the Collegium System has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability. Critics argue that the process can be opaque, leading to allegations of favoritism and nepotism. There have been calls for reform, including the reintroduction of the JAC or other mechanisms to enhance transparency in judicial appointments.\n\nIn summary, the Collegium System is a significant aspect of India's judicial framework, designed to protect the independence of the judiciary while also facing ongoing debates regarding its effectiveness and transparency.
