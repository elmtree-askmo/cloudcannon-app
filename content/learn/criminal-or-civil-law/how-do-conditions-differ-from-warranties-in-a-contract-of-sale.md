    How do conditions differ from warranties in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of the Sale of Goods Act, conditions and warranties are two distinct types of stipulations that play crucial roles in a contract of sale. Understanding the differences between them is essential for determining the rights and remedies available to the parties involved in the event of a breach.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Condition**: A condition is defined as a stipulation that is essential to the main purpose of the contract. The breach of a condition gives the aggrieved party the right to treat the contract as repudiated, meaning they can terminate the contract and seek damages. Conditions are fundamental to the contract's validity and performance.\n   - **Warranty**: A warranty, on the other hand, is a stipulation that is collateral to the main purpose of the contract. Breaching a warranty does not allow the aggrieved party to terminate the contract; instead, they can only claim damages for the breach. Warranties are considered secondary promises that do not affect the overall enforceability of the contract.\n\n2. **Legal Implications**:\n   - Breach of a **condition** allows the innocent party to terminate the contract and seek extensive legal remedies, including damages. This reflects the condition's integral role in the contract.\n   - Breach of a **warranty** typically results in compensatory damages but does not invalidate the contract. The contract remains in force, and the aggrieved party can only seek damages for the loss incurred due to the breach.\n\n3. **Examples**:\n   - An example of a condition might be a stipulation that the goods sold must meet certain quality standards. If the goods fail to meet these standards, the buyer can reject the goods and terminate the contract.\n   - An example of a warranty could be a promise that a product will function for a specified period. If the product fails during that period, the buyer can claim damages but must still fulfill their obligations under the contract.\n\nIn summary, conditions are fundamental to the contract's purpose and allow for termination upon breach, while warranties are secondary assurances that permit claims for damages without affecting the contract's validity. Understanding these distinctions is vital for both buyers and sellers in commercial transactions.
