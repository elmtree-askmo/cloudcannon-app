    What is escheat and when does it occur?
answer: >-
    Escheat is a legal doctrine that allows the government to take ownership of property when an individual dies without leaving a will or legal heirs. This process ensures that property does not remain unclaimed or in a state of "limbo" without recognized ownership. Escheat can occur in various scenarios, including:\n\n1. **Death Without Heirs**: When a person dies without any beneficiaries or heirs, their property may be transferred to the state. This is the most common situation in which escheat occurs.\n\n2. **Unclaimed Property**: Escheat can also happen when property, such as bank accounts or other assets, remains unclaimed for a prolonged period. Financial institutions are required to turn over these unclaimed assets to the state after a specified dormancy period.\n\n3. **Abandonment**: If a property is deemed abandoned, the government may claim it through escheat. This can include real estate or personal property that the owner has failed to claim or transfer legally.\n\n4. **Seizure for Non-Payment**: In some cases, escheat can occur when the government seizes property due to non-payment of taxes, fines, or other debts.\n\nThe escheatment process is enacted at the state level and serves to manage unclaimed property effectively, ensuring that it is not left without ownership.
