    What were the details of Madison Rutherford's life insurance policies?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford, a financial advisor from Connecticut, was involved in a notorious case of insurance fraud where he faked his own death to collect on life insurance policies totaling $7 million. At the time of the incident, he had two life insurance policies, one valued at $5 million and the other at $2 million. \n\nIn July 1998, Rutherford went on a trip to Mexico under the pretense of acquiring a rare breed of dog. He allegedly died in a car accident when his rental car struck an embankment and caught fire. However, suspicions arose when his widow attempted to claim the insurance money, prompting an investigation by the Kemper Life insurance company. \n\nDuring the investigation, it was revealed that Rutherford had desecrated a grave to place human remains in the car to support his fraudulent claim. The forensic evidence collected indicated inconsistencies with the remains found in the vehicle, leading to further scrutiny of his supposed death. Ultimately, prosecutors concluded that he had orchestrated the entire scheme to defraud the insurance companies.\n\nRutherford's case highlights the intersection of forensic investigation and financial crime, showcasing the role of forensic science in uncovering deception and fraud.
