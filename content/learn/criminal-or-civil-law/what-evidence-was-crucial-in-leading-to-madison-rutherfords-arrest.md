    What evidence was crucial in leading to Madison Rutherford's arrest?
answer: >-
    The evidence that was crucial in leading to Madison Rutherford's arrest included several key elements:\n\n1. **Faked Death and Insurance Fraud**: Madison Rutherford, who had taken out a $7 million life insurance policy, was initially declared dead in Mexico. His widow attempted to collect the insurance money shortly after the supposed accident, which raised suspicions and prompted an investigation by one of the insurance companies.\n\n2. **Desecration of a Grave**: During the investigation, it was revealed that Rutherford had desecrated a grave to place human remains in the car that was supposedly involved in the accident. This act was a significant piece of evidence against him, indicating the lengths he went to in order to fake his death.\n\n3. **DNA Evidence**: A DNA test conducted on blood found at the scene confirmed that it belonged to Madison Rutherford. This evidence was pivotal in linking him to the fraudulent scheme.\n\n4. **Identity Confirmation**: Investigators were able to connect Rutherford to another identity he was using, that of Thomas Bay Hamilton. A private investigator, Michael Garrigan, discovered that Hamilton and Rutherford were the same person while conducting a background check for a potential CFO position at a Boston company.\n\n5. **Fingerprints**: When Rutherford was arrested in Boston, he had his fingerprints on file, which further confirmed his identity as Madison Rutherford.\n\nThese pieces of evidence collectively led to his arrest and subsequent conviction for insurance fraud.
