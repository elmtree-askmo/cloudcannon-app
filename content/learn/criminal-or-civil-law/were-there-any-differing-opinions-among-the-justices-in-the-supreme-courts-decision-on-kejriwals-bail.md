answer: >-
    Yes, there were differing opinions among the justices in the Supreme Court's decision regarding Arvind Kejriwal's bail. The Division Bench, consisting of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan, granted bail to Kejriwal but had contrasting views on the legality of his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nJustice Surya Kant upheld the validity of the arrest, while Justice Ujjal Bhuyan expressed dissent, stating that the CBI's arrest "raises more questions than it seeks answers." Justice Bhuyan noted that the CBI had not deemed it necessary to arrest Kejriwal for over 22 months prior to his arrest, which occurred shortly after he was granted regular bail in a related case by a special judge in June 2024. This divergence in opinions highlights the complexities surrounding the legal interpretations of the arrest and the circumstances leading to it.
