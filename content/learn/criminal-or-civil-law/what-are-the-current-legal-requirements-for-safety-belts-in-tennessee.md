    What are the current legal requirements for safety belts in Tennessee?
answer: >-
    In Tennessee, the legal requirements for safety belts are outlined in Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 55-9-603. Here are the key points regarding safety belt laws in the state:\n\n1. **Primary Safety Belt Law**: Tennessee is classified as a primary safety belt state, meaning that law enforcement can stop and ticket a driver solely for not wearing a seat belt.\n\n2. **Driver and Front Seat Passenger Requirements**: All drivers and front seat passengers are required to wear safety belts at all times when the vehicle is in motion. This law mandates that the seat belt must be properly fastened around their bodies.\n\n3. **Child Restraint Requirements**: Children under the age of 18 must also be secured by a seat belt or a child restraint system, regardless of where they are seated in the vehicle. This includes the use of appropriate child safety seats for younger children.\n\n4. **Back Seat Passengers**: While Tennessee law does not require adult back seat passengers to wear seat belts, all children under 18 are still required to be secured by a seat belt or child restraint system.\n\n5. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with the seat belt law can result in a fine of $50.\n\n6. **Child Passenger Safety**: Tennessee has specific laws regarding child passenger safety, which include requirements for rear-facing car seats for children under one year of age or weighing less than 20 pounds, as well as booster seats for older children who do not meet the height and weight requirements for standard seat belts.\n\nThese laws are designed to enhance the safety of all vehicle occupants and reduce the risk of injury in the event of a crash. For more detailed information on child restraint laws, refer to T.C.A. 55-9-602.
