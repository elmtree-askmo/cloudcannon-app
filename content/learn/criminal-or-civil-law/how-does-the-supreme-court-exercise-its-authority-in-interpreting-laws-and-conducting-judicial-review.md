    How does the Supreme Court exercise its authority in interpreting laws and conducting judicial review?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of the United States exercises its authority in interpreting laws and conducting judicial review through several key mechanisms and principles that are foundational to the American legal system.\n\n1. **Judicial Review**: The power of judicial review allows the Supreme Court to evaluate the constitutionality of legislative acts and executive actions. This authority was established in the landmark case of *Marbury v. Madison* (1803), where Chief Justice John Marshall articulated that it is the duty of the judiciary to say what the law is. If a law or action is found to be in conflict with the Constitution, the Court has the power to invalidate it. This function is crucial for maintaining the rule of law and ensuring that all branches of government operate within their constitutional limits.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Laws**: The Supreme Court interprets laws by examining the text of statutes, the intent of the lawmakers, and the broader context of the law within the framework of the Constitution. Judicial interpretation is influenced by various factors, including historical context, precedent (stare decisis), and contemporary societal values. For instance, the Court's decisions on civil rights issues, such as desegregation and same-sex marriage, demonstrate how judicial interpretation can evolve to reflect changing societal norms.\n\n3. **Checks and Balances**: The Supreme Court plays a vital role in the system of checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution. By reviewing the actions of the legislative and executive branches, the Court ensures that no branch exceeds its authority. This balance is essential for protecting individual rights and maintaining democratic governance.\n\n4. **Landmark Cases**: The Supreme Court's authority is further exemplified through its rulings in landmark cases that have shaped American law and society. These cases often address fundamental issues of rights and liberties, and the Court's interpretations can lead to significant legal and social changes. For example, decisions like *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) illustrate the Court's role in advancing civil rights through its interpretations of the Constitution.\n\n5. **Final Arbiter of the Law**: As the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court serves as the final arbiter of legal disputes. Its decisions are binding on all lower courts, and its interpretations of the Constitution set precedents that guide future cases. This authority reinforces the Court's role as a guardian of the Constitution and protector of individual rights.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court exercises its authority through judicial review, interpretation of laws, and its role within the system of checks and balances. Its decisions not only resolve specific legal disputes but also shape the broader landscape of American law and civil rights.
