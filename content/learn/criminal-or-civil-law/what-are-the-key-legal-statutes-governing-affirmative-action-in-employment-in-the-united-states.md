    What are the key legal statutes governing affirmative action in employment in the United States?
answer: >-
    The key legal statutes governing affirmative action in employment in the United States primarily stem from the following sources:\n\n1. **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**: This is the foundational statute that prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. It provides the legal framework for affirmative action by allowing for voluntary affirmative action plans under certain conditions. Title VII has been amended by subsequent legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which further strengthen protections against discrimination.\n\n2. **Rehabilitation Act of 1973**: Specifically, Section 501(b) of this Act requires federal agencies to develop affirmative action plans for the employment and advancement of individuals with disabilities, including disabled veterans. This statute mandates that federal contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to recruit and advance qualified minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans.\n\n3. **Executive Order 11246**: This order prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunities. It is enforced by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).\n\n4. **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Guidelines**: The EEOC provides guidelines that interpret and enforce Title VII, including the establishment of affirmative action plans. These guidelines outline the obligations of employers to ensure that their employment practices are free from discrimination and promote equal opportunity.\n\n5. **State and Local Laws**: Many states and localities have their own affirmative action laws that may impose additional requirements on employers. These laws can vary significantly and may include specific mandates for affirmative action plans or programs.\n\n6. **Judicial Decisions**: Various Supreme Court rulings have shaped the legal landscape of affirmative action in employment, clarifying the conditions under which voluntary affirmative action plans can be implemented. For instance, the Court has ruled that such plans must be designed to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalances and cannot rely on quotas or blanket "plus factors."\n\nThese statutes and regulations collectively create a complex legal framework that governs affirmative action in employment, balancing the need for equal opportunity with the prohibition of discrimination.
