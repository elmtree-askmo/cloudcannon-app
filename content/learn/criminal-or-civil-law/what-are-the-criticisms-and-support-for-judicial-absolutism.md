    What are the criticisms and support for judicial absolutism?
answer: >-
    Judicial absolutism, the belief that judicial decisions are final and not subject to challenge, has garnered both support and criticism within legal and political discourse. Here are some key points regarding the criticisms and support for this doctrine:\n\n### Support for Judicial Absolutism\n1. **Finality of Decisions**: Proponents argue that judicial absolutism provides a necessary finality to legal decisions, ensuring that once a court has ruled, the matter is settled. This is seen as essential for maintaining order and predictability in the law.\n2. **Protection of Rights**: Supporters contend that an absolutist approach can protect individual rights against the whims of the majority or legislative bodies. By having the judiciary as a final arbiter, fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution can be safeguarded from potential infringement.\n3. **Judicial Independence**: Advocates believe that judicial absolutism reinforces the independence of the judiciary, allowing judges to make decisions based on legal principles rather than political pressures. This independence is crucial for upholding the rule of law.\n\n### Criticisms of Judicial Absolutism\n1. **Lack of Accountability**: Critics argue that judicial absolutism can lead to a lack of accountability for judges, as their decisions are not subject to review or challenge. This can result in judicial overreach, where courts impose their interpretations without regard for democratic processes.\n2. **Conflict with Other Constitutional Principles**: Many critics advocate for a balancing approach, suggesting that the First Amendment and other rights should be interpreted in the context of the entire Constitution. They argue that rights can conflict, and resolving these conflicts requires a more nuanced approach than absolutism allows.\n3. **Historical Context**: Historical examples, such as the Dred Scott decision, illustrate the dangers of treating judicial decisions as infallible. Critics like Abraham Lincoln have pointed out that the Supreme Court's rulings should not be considered settled law if they are fundamentally unjust or contrary to evolving societal values.\n4. **Judicial Restraint**: Opponents of judicial absolutism often support the concept of judicial restraint, which encourages judges to limit their own power and avoid striking down laws unless they are clearly unconstitutional. This approach promotes a more collaborative relationship between the judiciary and the legislative branches.\n\nIn summary, while judicial absolutism is supported for its potential to protect rights and ensure legal finality, it faces significant criticism for its implications on accountability, the potential for judicial overreach, and its historical consequences. The debate continues as to the appropriate role of the judiciary in a democratic society, balancing the need for judicial independence with the principles of accountability and democratic governance.
