    What rationale did the Supreme Court provide for dismissing the arms export petition?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India dismissed the petition seeking to halt arms exports to Israel during its ongoing conflict in Gaza, primarily on the grounds that it is beyond the court's jurisdiction to interfere in matters of foreign policy. The court emphasized that such decisions are the prerogative of the government, not the judiciary. The petition, which was a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), argued that supplying military equipment to Israel could potentially violate international obligations under the UN Convention. However, the court's bench, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, stated that it cannot grant directions to cancel existing licenses or prevent the issuance of new licenses for arms exports, reinforcing the principle that foreign policy decisions are to be made by the executive branch of the government.
