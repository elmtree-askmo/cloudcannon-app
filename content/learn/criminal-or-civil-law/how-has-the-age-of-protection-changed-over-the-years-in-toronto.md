    How has the age of protection changed over the years in Toronto?
answer: >-
    The age of protection in Toronto has undergone significant changes, particularly with the amendments to the Child and Family Services Act (CFSA) that took effect on January 1, 2018. Prior to this change, the age of protection was set at 16 years. However, in 2018, Ontario raised the age of protection to include youth up to 18 years of age. This means that youth who are 16 and 17 years old are now eligible to receive protection services from Children's Aid Societies.\n\nThe change was a result of advocacy efforts by the Ontario Association of Children's Aid Societies (OACAS) and various Children's Aid Societies, which had been pushing for this adjustment for over two decades. The new regulations allow for a more tailored approach to service delivery for older youth, recognizing that they may require different support compared to younger children.\n\nWhile reporting concerns regarding 16- and 17-year-olds is not mandatory, it is encouraged for professionals or members of the public who believe that these youth may be in need of protection to contact their local Children's Aid Society. The agency is then required to assess the reported information.\n\nOverall, this change reflects a broader understanding of the needs of older youth in the child protection system and aims to provide them with the necessary support and services.
