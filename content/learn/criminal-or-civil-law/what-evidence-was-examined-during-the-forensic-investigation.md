    What evidence was examined during the forensic investigation?
answer: >-
    During forensic investigations, a variety of evidence is examined to establish connections between suspects and crime scenes, as well as to reconstruct the events surrounding a crime. The types of evidence typically collected and analyzed include:\n\n1. **Physical Evidence**: This encompasses a wide range of items that can be found at a crime scene, such as fingerprints, footprints, tire tracks, blood, body fluids, hairs, fibers, and fire debris. Each of these can provide critical information about the individuals involved and the circumstances of the crime.\n\n2. **DNA Evidence**: Forensic examiners often analyze DNA profiles from samples found at the crime scene. This involves comparing the DNA of suspects to that found in biological samples (e.g., blood, saliva) to determine if there is a match.\n\n3. **Skeletal Remains**: In cases involving human remains, forensic anthropologists examine bones to assess various characteristics such as age at death, sex, stature, and ancestry. They can also identify injuries and estimate the time since death, which can be crucial for investigations.\n\n4. **Dental Evidence**: Forensic odontologists analyze dental records and the condition of teeth to identify individuals. This can include examining the development and anatomy of teeth, as well as any restorative work that has been done.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Crime scene investigators document the scene through photographs and physical measurements, which helps in re-creating the sequence of events. Proper documentation is essential for maintaining the chain of custody of the evidence.\n\n6. **Latent Prints**: Investigators may also look for latent fingerprints, which require specific techniques to reveal and collect.\n\nIn the case of Madison Rutherford, forensic evidence included the analysis of skeletal remains, which revealed inconsistencies in the identity of the remains compared to what was expected, leading to further investigation into his true identity and activities. This comprehensive approach to evidence collection and analysis is vital in forensic investigations to ensure that all relevant information is considered in solving crimes.
