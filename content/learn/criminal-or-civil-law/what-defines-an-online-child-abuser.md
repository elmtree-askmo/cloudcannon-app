    What defines an online child abuser?
answer: >-
    An online child abuser is typically defined as an individual who engages in the sexual exploitation or abuse of children through the use of information and communication technology. This can include a variety of harmful behaviors, such as:\n\n1. **Coercion and Manipulation**: Online child sexual exploitation often involves coercing or manipulating a child into creating, viewing, or sharing sexually explicit images or videos. This can occur through deceptive conversations or pressure tactics.\n\n2. **Grooming**: Grooming is a process where an abuser builds a relationship with a child to gain their trust with the intent of sexually abusing them. This can happen through online platforms where the abuser may pose as a peer or a trusted adult.\n\n3. **Image-Based Abuse**: This includes the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse material, which has seen a significant increase in reports. For instance, in 2023, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received 36 million reports of such material, highlighting the scale of the issue.\n\n4. **Peer-on-Peer Abuse**: Online child sexual abuse can also occur between children, often referred to as child-on-child or peer-on-peer abuse. This can involve one child coercing another into sexual activities or sharing explicit content.\n\n5. **Technology Facilitation**: The online environment can obscure abusive dynamics that might be more apparent in face-to-face interactions. This anonymity can make it easier for perpetrators to exploit children without immediate detection.\n\nOverall, online child abusers exploit the vulnerabilities of children and teens, using technology as a means to perpetrate their crimes. The consequences of such abuse can be profound and long-lasting, affecting the mental and emotional well-being of victims.
