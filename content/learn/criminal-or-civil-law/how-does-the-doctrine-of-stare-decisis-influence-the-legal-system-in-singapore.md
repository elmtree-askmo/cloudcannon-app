    How does the doctrine of stare decisis influence the legal system in Singapore?
answer: >-
    The doctrine of stare decisis plays a crucial role in the legal system of Singapore, ensuring consistency and predictability in the application of the law. This principle mandates that courts are bound to follow the legal reasoning (ratio decidendi) established in previous decisions, particularly those from higher courts. Here are some key aspects of how stare decisis influences the legal framework in Singapore:\n\n1. **Binding Precedents**: In Singapore, the decisions of higher courts, especially the Court of Appeal, are binding on lower courts. This means that if a higher court has ruled on a legal issue, lower courts must adhere to that ruling in future cases with similar facts. This practice promotes legal certainty and stability, which are essential for the rule of law.\n\n2. **Influence of English Law**: Singapore's legal system is rooted in English common law, and the doctrine of stare decisis extends to English judicial precedents. The ratio decidendi of English cases can be binding on Singaporean courts, particularly in areas where local case law is not well developed. This reliance on English precedents is significant in shaping the legal landscape, although there is a gradual shift towards developing a more localized legal framework.\n\n3. **Abolition of Privy Council Appeals**: The abolition of appeals to the Privy Council in 1994 marked a turning point in Singapore's legal system. While earlier decisions from the Privy Council remain binding, those made after this date do not have binding authority. This change has encouraged Singaporean courts to rely more on local precedents and to develop legal principles that reflect Singaporean values and societal norms.\n\n4. **Horizontal and Vertical Stare Decisis**: The doctrine encompasses both horizontal and vertical aspects. Vertical stare decisis refers to the obligation of lower courts to follow the decisions of higher courts, while horizontal stare decisis pertains to a court's obligation to follow its own previous decisions. This dual structure reinforces the stability of legal interpretations over time.\n\n5. **Persuasive Precedents**: In the absence of local case law, Singaporean courts may also consider judicial precedents from other common law jurisdictions, such as India and Australia, as persuasive authority. This practice allows for a broader interpretation of legal principles and helps to fill gaps in the local legal framework.\n\nIn summary, the doctrine of stare decisis is fundamental to the legal system in Singapore, ensuring that similar cases are treated consistently and that the law evolves in a stable and predictable manner. While the influence of English law remains significant, the ongoing development of local legal principles reflects Singapore's unique societal context.
