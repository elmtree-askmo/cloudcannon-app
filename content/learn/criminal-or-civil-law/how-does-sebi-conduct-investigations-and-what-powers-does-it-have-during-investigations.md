    How does SEBI conduct investigations and what powers does it have during investigations?
answer: >-
    The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducts investigations under the authority granted by the SEBI Act, 1992, specifically through Section 11C. This section empowers SEBI to initiate investigations into transactions in securities or the conduct of intermediaries if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such actions are detrimental to investors or violate the provisions of the SEBI Act, rules, or regulations.\n\n### Powers of SEBI During Investigations\n\n1. **Summoning Individuals**: Under Section 11C(3), SEBI has the authority to summon and examine any individual or intermediary under oath. This is crucial for gathering information and evidence necessary for the investigation.\n\n2. **Access to Documents**: Section 11C(2) mandates that all books, registers, and documents related to the company must be preserved and produced to the investigating authority. This includes records from directors, officers, and employees of the firm, ensuring that SEBI can access all relevant information.\n\n3. **Search and Seizure**: SEBI possesses powers akin to those of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which includes the ability to conduct searches and seizures of documents and records that may be pertinent to the investigation.\n\n4. **Conducting On-Site Inspections**: SEBI can conduct on-site inspections to gather evidence of misconduct, which is essential for thorough investigations.\n\n5. **Issuing Directions**: Under Section 11B, SEBI can issue directions to protect the interests of investors and the securities market. This includes the ability to pass ad-interim orders when urgent action is required.\n\n6. **Reporting and Recommendations**: After conducting an investigation, SEBI can direct individuals to report on their findings, which aids in the regulatory process and ensures accountability.\n\n7. **Enforcement Actions**: If violations are found, SEBI has the authority to take punitive actions, including imposing penalties and initiating prosecution for non-compliance with securities laws.\n\nThese powers enable SEBI to effectively regulate the securities market, protect investors, maintain transparency, and prevent fraudulent practices. The investigative process is designed to be comprehensive, allowing SEBI to function in a quasi-judicial capacity when examining investigation reports and taking necessary actions based on findings.
