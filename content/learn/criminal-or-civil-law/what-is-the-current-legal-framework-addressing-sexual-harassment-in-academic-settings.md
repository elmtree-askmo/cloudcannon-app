    What is the current legal framework addressing sexual harassment in academic settings?
answer: >-
    The current legal framework addressing sexual harassment in academic settings in India is primarily governed by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. This legislation was enacted following the foundational Vishaka Guidelines, which recognized sexual harassment as a violation of fundamental rights. The Act aims to provide a safe working environment for women and includes provisions for the prevention and redressal of complaints of sexual harassment.\n\nKey aspects of the legal framework include:\n\n1. **Definition of Sexual Harassment**: The Act defines sexual harassment in various forms, including physical, verbal, and non-verbal harassment. It recognizes that such conduct can severely impact the safety, dignity, and academic success of students and employees.\n\n2. **Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)**: Educational institutions are required to establish Internal Complaints Committees to address complaints of sexual harassment. These committees are tasked with investigating complaints and ensuring that appropriate actions are taken.\n\n3. **Reporting Mechanisms**: The Act encourages reporting of incidents of sexual harassment and mandates that institutions take necessary steps to protect complainants from retaliation.\n\n4. **Amendments and Updates**: The Act has undergone amendments, with the most recent updates in 2020, which further clarify the procedures and responsibilities of institutions in handling complaints.\n\n5. **Comparative Framework**: The legal framework in India is often compared with that of other countries, such as Pakistan, where similar issues of sexual harassment in educational settings are addressed, albeit with noted deficiencies.\n\nOverall, while the legal framework in India has made significant strides in addressing sexual harassment in academic settings, challenges remain in terms of reporting, enforcement, and the effectiveness of the mechanisms in place. The issue continues to be a major concern, necessitating ongoing efforts to improve the safety and dignity of individuals in educational institutions.
