    What are the rights of an unpaid seller against the goods?
answer: >-
    Under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, an unpaid seller has specific rights against the goods that help protect their financial interests when the buyer fails to fulfill payment obligations. These rights are outlined primarily in Sections 46 to 52 of the Act. Here are the key rights of an unpaid seller against the goods:\n\n1. **Right of Lien (Sections 47-49)**: The unpaid seller has the right to retain possession of the goods until the payment is made. This right allows the seller to hold onto the goods as security for the payment of the price. If the seller is in possession of the goods, they can exercise this right even if the property in the goods has passed to the buyer.\n\n2. **Right of Stoppage in Transit (Section 50)**: If the buyer becomes insolvent, the unpaid seller has the right to stop the goods in transit. This means that the seller can reclaim the goods from the carrier or any intermediary before they reach the buyer, provided the goods are still in transit.\n\n3. **Right to Resell (Section 54)**: The unpaid seller has the right to resell the goods if the buyer defaults on payment. This right can be exercised after giving reasonable notice to the buyer. The proceeds from the resale can be used to cover the unpaid price.\n\n4. **Right to Sue for Price or Damages (Section 55)**: The unpaid seller can take legal action against the buyer to recover the price of the goods or seek damages for non-acceptance of the goods.\n\nThese rights are designed to provide sellers with effective remedies to secure their financial interests in commercial transactions. Understanding these rights is crucial for sellers to navigate situations where buyers default on payment.
