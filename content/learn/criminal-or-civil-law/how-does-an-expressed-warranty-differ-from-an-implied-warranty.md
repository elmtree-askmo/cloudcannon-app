    How does an expressed warranty differ from an implied warranty?
answer: >-
    An express warranty and an implied warranty are two distinct types of guarantees that a seller provides to a buyer regarding the quality and performance of goods sold.\n\n1. **Express Warranty**: This is a specific promise made by the seller to the buyer, which can be communicated either orally or in writing. An express warranty clearly outlines the terms and conditions of the warranty, and it is a form of contractual agreement that the buyer relies on when making a purchase. For example, if a seller states that a product is guaranteed to last for two years, that statement constitutes an express warranty. The seller is legally bound to fulfill this promise.\n\n2. **Implied Warranty**: In contrast, an implied warranty is not explicitly stated but is automatically assumed to exist based on the nature of the transaction and the expectations of the buyer. Implied warranties are established by law and provide a baseline level of protection for consumers. For instance, under the Sale of Goods Act, there are implied warranties that goods sold are of satisfactory quality and fit for the purpose intended. These warranties exist even if the seller does not make any specific promises about the product.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in how they are established: express warranties are explicitly stated by the seller, while implied warranties are automatically provided by law based on the circumstances of the sale.
