answer: >-
    The short-swing profit rule is a federal statute established under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule mandates that corporate insiders—such as executives, directors, and large shareholders—must forfeit any profits made from the purchase and sale of their company's stock if both transactions occur within a six-month period. \n\nThe primary purpose of the short-swing profit rule is to prevent insiders from exploiting their access to non-public, material information for short-term trading gains, thereby promoting fair trading practices in the securities market. By restricting the ability of insiders to profit from rapid buying and selling, the rule aims to mitigate the risks associated with insider trading, which can undermine investor confidence and market integrity.\n\nIn essence, if an insider buys shares of their company and then sells them within six months, any profits realized from that transaction must be returned to the company. This regulatory measure serves as a deterrent against potential abuses of insider information, ensuring that all investors have a level playing field when it comes to trading in a company's securities.
