    What ethical guidelines must judges follow in their conduct?
answer: >-
    Judges are required to adhere to a set of ethical guidelines that ensure their conduct promotes the integrity and independence of the judiciary. The primary framework for these guidelines in the United States is the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which has been in place since 1973. This Code outlines several key canons that govern judges' behavior, including:\n\n1. **Judicial Integrity and Independence**: Judges must maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary, ensuring that their decisions are made based on the law and facts, free from external influences.\n\n2. **Judicial Diligence and Impartiality**: Judges are expected to perform their duties diligently and impartially, treating all parties with fairness and respect.\n\n3. **Permissible Extra-Judicial Activities**: While judges are allowed to engage in certain outside activities, they must avoid any that could compromise their impartiality or the appearance of impropriety.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Impropriety**: Judges must avoid not only actual impropriety but also the appearance of impropriety in all activities, both professional and personal.\n\n5. **Disqualification**: Judges are required to disqualify themselves from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, such as in situations involving personal relationships or financial interests.\n\nIn addition to these canons, the recently adopted Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, issued on November 13, 2023, further emphasizes ethical standards for Supreme Court justices, including guidelines on receiving gifts and disqualification.\n\nOverall, these ethical guidelines are designed to uphold the public's trust in the judicial system by ensuring that judges act with integrity, impartiality, and professionalism in all aspects of their conduct.
