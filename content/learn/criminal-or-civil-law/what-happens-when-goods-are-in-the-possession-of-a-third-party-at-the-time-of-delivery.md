    What happens when goods are in the possession of a third party at the time of delivery?
answer: >-
    When goods are in the possession of a third party at the time of delivery, the Sale of Goods Act stipulates specific conditions regarding the delivery of those goods. According to Section 36(3) of the Act, there is no delivery of the goods until the third party acknowledges that they are holding the goods on behalf of the buyer. This means that the mere physical possession of the goods by the third party does not constitute delivery to the buyer.\n\nIn practical terms, for the delivery to be recognized, the third party must explicitly confirm to the buyer that they are acting on the buyer's behalf. Until such acknowledgment occurs, the goods remain in the custody of the third party, and the buyer does not have the right to exercise control over them.\n\nThis provision highlights the importance of constructive delivery in commercial transactions, where the intention of the parties and the acknowledgment of the third party play crucial roles in the transfer of ownership and rights associated with the goods. Thus, the legal framework ensures that the buyer's entitlement to the goods is effectively established only when the third party recognizes their role in the transaction.
