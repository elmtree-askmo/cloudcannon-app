answer: >-
    Yes, there have been notable recent cases of demolitions that have reached the Supreme Court of India. The Court has been actively addressing the issue of unlawful demolitions, particularly those referred to as "bulldozer justice," where state authorities have demolished properties of individuals accused of crimes without following due legal processes.\n\nOn October 1, 2024, a Division Bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan reserved judgment on a batch of petitions challenging these unlawful demolitions. The Supreme Court has been hearing these petitions since 2022, with significant hearings occurring in September 2024. The Court has expressed strong opposition to arbitrary demolitions, emphasizing the need for adherence to the rule of law and due process.\n\nIn a landmark ruling on November 13, 2024, the Supreme Court observed that such demolitions violate the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers, asserting that only the judiciary can determine guilt. The Court laid down comprehensive guidelines for legal demolitions, mandating that authorities provide at least 15 days' notice before any demolition and allowing individuals to challenge these orders. The guidelines also require accountability measures for officials involved in the demolition process.\n\nAdditionally, the Court's ruling specifically excludes unauthorized structures in public places and cases with existing court demolition orders, thereby ensuring that due process is followed in all demolition actions. This series of rulings and guidelines reflects the Supreme Court's commitment to curbing illegal demolitions and protecting citizens' rights.
