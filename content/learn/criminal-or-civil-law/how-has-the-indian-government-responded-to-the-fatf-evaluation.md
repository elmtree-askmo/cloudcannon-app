    How has the Indian government responded to the FATF evaluation?
answer: >-
    The Indian government's response to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) evaluation has been notably positive, reflecting significant progress in its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) measures. In the recent Mutual Evaluation Report adopted during the FATF plenary held in Singapore from June 26 to June 28, 2024, India was recognized for achieving a "high level of technical compliance" with FATF recommendations. This places India in the 'regular follow-up' category, a distinction shared by only four other G20 countries.\n\nThe evaluation highlighted India's effective measures in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including the transition from a cash-based to a digital economy, the implementation of the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) Trinity, and strict enforcement of cash transaction regulations. The FATF's assessment also noted positive results in international cooperation, asset recovery, and the implementation of targeted financial sanctions for proliferation financing.\n\nFurthermore, the FATF-APG-EAG joint assessment concluded that India has established an AML/CFT framework that is yielding good results, particularly in understanding risks, accessing beneficial ownership information, and depriving criminals of their assets. The Indian government has acknowledged the need for continuous improvement in its systems to address money laundering and terrorist financing effectively, especially as the economy and financial system evolve.\n\nOverall, the Indian government's proactive approach and the positive evaluation from FATF underscore its commitment to enhancing its financial integrity and compliance with international standards.
