    What was the impact of the Lochner era on modern constitutional law?
answer: >-
    The impact of the Lochner era on modern constitutional law is profound and multifaceted, shaping the landscape of judicial review and the interpretation of individual rights, particularly economic liberties. The era, which spanned from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, is characterized by the Supreme Court's use of substantive due process to invalidate numerous laws that were seen as infringing on the freedom of contract. This judicial approach was exemplified in the landmark case of *Lochner v. New York* (1905), where the Court struck down a New York law that limited the working hours of bakers, asserting that such regulations violated the 14th Amendment's due process clause.\n\nDuring the Lochner era, the Supreme Court invalidated 159 statutes under the due process and equal protection clauses, reflecting a strong commitment to protecting economic liberties. This period is often viewed as a time when the Court exercised what some scholars term "judicial absolutism," prioritizing individual economic rights over legislative efforts to regulate labor conditions and protect workers. The legacy of this era has led to ongoing debates about the role of the judiciary in economic regulation and the balance between state interests and individual rights.\n\nIn contemporary constitutional discourse, the Lochner era serves as a cautionary tale regarding the potential dangers of judicial review. It has influenced modern interpretations of substantive due process, particularly in cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), where the Court began to recognize unenumerated rights under the Due Process Clause. This shift indicates a broader understanding of constitutional protections that extend beyond mere procedural rights to include substantive rights, which has implications for various areas of law, including privacy and personal autonomy.\n\nMoreover, the Lochner era has prompted a reevaluation of constitutional theory, with some scholars arguing for a more nuanced understanding of judicial power and its limits. While Lochner is often criticized for its overreach, it also laid the groundwork for the expansion of rights that continue to evolve in modern jurisprudence. The era's legacy is evident in ongoing discussions about the balance between individual freedoms and state interests, particularly in the context of economic regulation, health and labor conditions, and civil rights.\n\nIn summary, the Lochner era has left an indelible mark on modern constitutional law, influencing judicial methodologies, the interpretation of substantive due process, and the ongoing dialogue about the role of the judiciary in protecting individual rights against state encroachment. Its historical context continues to resonate in contemporary legal debates, making it a pivotal reference point in the evolution of American constitutional jurisprudence.
