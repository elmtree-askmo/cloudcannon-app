    What recommendations have been made by expert panels regarding drug driving legislation?
answer: >-
    Expert panels have made several recommendations regarding drug driving legislation, particularly in the context of improving road safety and addressing the challenges posed by drug-impaired driving. Here are some key recommendations derived from various reports and expert analyses:\n\n1. **Drug Classification and Limits**: The Expert Panel on Drug Driving has recommended specific drugs to be included in new drug driving offenses, along with proposed limits for each substance. This aims to create a clearer framework for enforcement and prosecution.\n\n2. **High-Risk Offender Schemes**: Recommendations have been made for implementing a high-risk offender scheme specifically for drug drivers. This would involve stricter monitoring and rehabilitation measures for individuals identified as high-risk due to repeated drug driving offenses.\n\n3. **Improved Detection Methods**: The North Review, published in June 2010, emphasized the need for improved methods of detecting drug driving. This includes the development of more effective roadside testing and laboratory analysis to ensure accurate identification of drug impairment.\n\n4. **Legislative Adjustments**: Expert panels have suggested that existing drug-impaired driving laws should be modified to better reflect the realities of drug use and its effects on driving. This includes considering the pharmacokinetics of substances like cannabis, which can remain detectable long after their impairing effects have worn off.\n\n5. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: There is a call for enhanced public education campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of drug driving and the legal consequences associated with it. This is particularly important in light of changing attitudes towards substances like cannabis.\n\n6. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**: Recommendations include fostering better collaboration between law enforcement agencies and public health organizations to address drug driving comprehensively. This could involve training for officers on recognizing drug impairment and understanding the nuances of drug-related offenses.\n\n7. **Research and Data Collection**: Ongoing research into the effects of various substances on driving behavior is crucial. Expert panels have recommended that data collection efforts be strengthened to inform future legislation and public health initiatives.\n\nThese recommendations reflect a comprehensive approach to tackling drug driving, focusing on prevention, detection, and enforcement to enhance road safety.
