    What is the background of the NCP symbol dispute?
answer: >-
    The NCP symbol dispute centers around a significant political conflict within the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in India, primarily between two factions led by Sharad Pawar and his nephew Ajit Pawar. The dispute escalated following a decision by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on February 6, which recognized the Ajit Pawar faction as the "real" NCP and granted them the party's official symbol, the 'clock'. This decision was a major setback for Sharad Pawar, the party's founder.\n\nThe conflict has its roots in a split within the party, with Ajit Pawar leading a breakaway faction. The ECI's ruling not only allocated the 'clock' symbol to Ajit Pawar's group but also assigned a different symbol, 'man blowing turha', to Sharad Pawar's faction. This division has led to confusion among voters, particularly during elections, as both factions claim legitimacy over the NCP's identity and symbols.\n\nIn response to the ECI's decision, Sharad Pawar filed a petition with the Supreme Court, contesting the allocation of the 'clock' symbol to Ajit Pawar's faction. The Supreme Court has since intervened, instructing both factions to adhere to its orders regarding the use of party symbols and names. It has also mandated that the Ajit Pawar faction publicly declare that the allocation of the 'clock' symbol is sub judice, meaning it is under judicial consideration.\n\nThe Supreme Court's involvement highlights the ongoing legal and political battle over the control of the NCP, with significant implications for both factions as they prepare for upcoming elections. The court's rulings aim to clarify the status of the party and its symbols amidst the ongoing factional dispute.
