    What constitutes a quorum in the Indian Parliament?
answer: >-
    In the Indian Parliament, the quorum required to constitute a meeting of either House is defined by Article 100 of the Indian Constitution. Specifically, the quorum is set at one-tenth of the total number of members of that House. This means that for the Lok Sabha, which has a total membership of 545, at least 55 members must be present to conduct any business. Similarly, for the Rajya Sabha, which has a total membership of 250, a minimum of 25 members must be present.\n\nIf a quorum is not met, it is the responsibility of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Vice-President (who acts as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) to adjourn the House or suspend the meeting until a quorum is achieved. This quorum requirement is crucial as it ensures that decisions are made with adequate representation, thereby upholding the democratic legitimacy of the legislative process and preventing the influence of small groups on significant legislative matters.
