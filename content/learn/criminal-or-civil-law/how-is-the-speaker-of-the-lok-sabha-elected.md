    How is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha elected?
answer: >-
    The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected from among its members shortly after the first sitting of the Lok Sabha, typically during the first session following general elections. The election process requires a simple majority of the members present and voting in the House. This means that only sitting members of the Lok Sabha are eligible to be elected as Speaker.\n\nThe date for the election of the Speaker is determined by the President of India and is scheduled as soon as possible after the first sitting of the House. The Speaker does not have a fixed term and remains in office during the life of the Lok Sabha, subject to the pleasure of the House. Additionally, the Speaker can be removed from office by a resolution passed by a majority of all current members of the Lok Sabha, as stipulated in Article 94 of the Constitution of India.\n\nIn summary, the election of the Speaker is a crucial procedure in the functioning of the Lok Sabha, ensuring that the legislative process is conducted smoothly and impartially.
