    What were the findings of the recent FATF evaluation of India's compliance?
answer: >-
    The recent evaluation of India's compliance by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for the 2023-24 period has yielded significant findings. India has achieved an "outstanding outcome" in its Mutual Evaluation, which was adopted during the FATF plenary held in Singapore from June 26 to June 28, 2024. This evaluation highlights India's effective measures in combating money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF).\n\nKey findings from the evaluation include:\n\n1. **High Level of Technical Compliance**: India has been recognized for achieving a high level of technical compliance with the FATF Recommendations. This indicates that the country has implemented robust frameworks and measures to address issues related to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-Up Category**: India has been placed in the "regular follow-up" category, a distinction shared by only four other G20 countries. This category reflects the FATF's acknowledgment of India's ongoing efforts and commitment to improving its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) systems.\n\n3. **Effective Measures**: The evaluation report emphasizes India's transition from a cash-based economy to a digital economy, the implementation of the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) Trinity, and the enforcement of strict cash transaction regulations as effective measures in combating illicit finance.\n\n4. **Continued Improvement Needed**: Despite the positive evaluation, the FATF report stresses the importance of continued improvements in India's systems, particularly as the economy and financial system grow. It highlights the need for timely completion of money laundering and terrorist financing trials and appropriate sanctions for offenders.\n\n5. **Good Results in Risk Understanding**: The FATF-APG-EAG assessment indicates that India has made good progress in understanding risks, accessing beneficial ownership information, and depriving criminals of their assets.\n\nOverall, the FATF's evaluation underscores India's commitment to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, while also pointing out areas for further enhancement to ensure the effectiveness of its financial systems.
