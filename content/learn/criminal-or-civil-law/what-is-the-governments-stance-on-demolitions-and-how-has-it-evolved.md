    What is the government's stance on demolitions and how has it evolved?
answer: >-
    The government's stance on demolitions in India has evolved significantly, particularly in response to the Supreme Court's recent rulings aimed at curbing arbitrary demolitions often referred to as "bulldozer justice." This term describes the practice where local state governments use bulldozers to demolish properties of individuals accused of crimes, frequently bypassing established legal procedures.\n\nIn a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court declared that demolishing a person's property without adhering to due process is unconstitutional. The court emphasized the right to shelter and mandated that authorities must provide a 15-day notice before any demolition action is taken. This notice allows occupants the opportunity to challenge the demolition order or make necessary arrangements before eviction. The guidelines issued by the Supreme Court also require video recording of the demolition process and public display of the demolition notice, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThe Supreme Court's guidelines are intended to establish a uniform legal framework for property demolitions across the country, ensuring that such actions are conducted in accordance with legal procedures. However, these guidelines do not apply in cases where the unauthorized structure is located on public roads, railway lines, footpaths, or water bodies, or if a demolition has been ordered by a court.\n\nDespite these judicial interventions, the practice of "bulldozer justice" has continued in some states, particularly those governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), indicating a gap between the Supreme Court's directives and the actions of local authorities. The court's rulings reflect a broader commitment to uphold the rule of law and protect individual rights against arbitrary state actions.\n\nIn summary, the government's stance on demolitions has shifted towards a more regulated approach, emphasizing due process and legal compliance, largely influenced by the Supreme Court's efforts to curb the misuse of demolition as a punitive measure.
