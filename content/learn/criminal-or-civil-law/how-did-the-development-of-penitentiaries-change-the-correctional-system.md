    How did the development of penitentiaries change the correctional system?
answer: >-
    The development of penitentiaries significantly transformed the correctional system by introducing a structured approach to incarceration that emphasized rehabilitation over mere punishment. Initially conceived as an alternative to the death penalty, penitentiaries aimed to reform prisoners through isolation and reflection. This shift marked a departure from earlier punitive measures, which often included corporal punishment and public humiliation.\n\nThe evolution of penitentiaries can be traced through two primary models: the Pennsylvania system and the Auburn system. The Pennsylvania system, exemplified by the Eastern Penitentiary in Philadelphia, focused on separate and solitary confinement, where inmates performed labor in their cells and had minimal interaction with others. This model was based on the belief that isolation would lead to penitence and moral reform.\n\nIn contrast, the Auburn system, developed later, allowed inmates to work together during the day but required silence and solitary confinement at night. This approach aimed to balance the need for labor and social interaction while still promoting discipline and reform.\n\nThe reform movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries further influenced the correctional landscape, as advocates pushed for changes that prioritized rehabilitation. This period saw the establishment of reformatories and the introduction of programs designed to address the underlying causes of criminal behavior, such as poverty and mental health issues. The legacy of these reforms continues to shape contemporary correctional practices, fostering ongoing debates about the balance between punishment and rehabilitation in the criminal justice system.\n\nOverall, the development of penitentiaries marked a pivotal shift in correctional philosophy, laying the groundwork for modern approaches that seek to integrate rehabilitation and mental health treatment into the correctional process. This evolution reflects a broader understanding of crime as a complex social issue, necessitating a compassionate and rehabilitative response.
