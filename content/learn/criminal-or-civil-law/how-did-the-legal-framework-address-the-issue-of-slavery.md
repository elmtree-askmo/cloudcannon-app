    How did the legal framework address the issue of slavery?
answer: >-
    The legal framework addressing the issue of slavery has evolved significantly over time, particularly through various international conventions and national laws aimed at eradicating slavery in all its forms. Key legal documents that have shaped this framework include:\n\n1. **1926 Slavery Convention**: This was one of the first international treaties to explicitly prohibit slavery. It established a legal definition of slavery and called for the suppression of the slave trade.\n\n2. **1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery**: This treaty expanded upon the 1926 Convention by addressing not only slavery but also practices similar to slavery, such as servitude and forced labor. It aimed to strengthen international accountability for violations related to slavery.\n\n3. **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)**: This foundational document asserts the inherent dignity and equal rights of all individuals, implicitly condemning slavery and servitude.\n\n4. **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966)**: This covenant further reinforces the prohibition of slavery and servitude, emphasizing the protection of individual rights.\n\n5. **UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons (2000)**: Commonly known as the Palermo Protocol, this document addresses modern forms of slavery, particularly human trafficking, and aims to enhance international cooperation in combating these practices.\n\nIn the United States, the legal framework evolved through significant legislative actions and constitutional amendments. The **13th Amendment**, ratified in 1865, formally abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. This amendment marked a pivotal moment in U.S. history, legally ending the institution of slavery.\n\nAdditionally, historical legislative efforts, such as the **Compromise of 1850**, attempted to address the contentious issue of slavery in new territories acquired after the Mexican-American War. This compromise included provisions that allowed for the continuation of slavery in certain areas while attempting to balance the interests of free and slave states.\n\nOverall, the legal framework addressing slavery has been shaped by a combination of international treaties and national laws, reflecting a growing consensus against slavery and a commitment to human rights. The evolution of these laws demonstrates an ongoing effort to confront and rectify the legacies of slavery and ensure accountability for violations.
