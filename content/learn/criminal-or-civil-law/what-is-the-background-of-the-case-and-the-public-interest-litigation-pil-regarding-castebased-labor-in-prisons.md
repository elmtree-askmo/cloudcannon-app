    What is the background of the case and the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) regarding caste-based labor in prisons?
answer: >-
    The case regarding caste-based labor in Indian prisons has its roots in the historical context of caste discrimination, which can be traced back to colonial India. The enactment of the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871 by the British Raj laid the groundwork for systemic caste-based discrimination, which has persisted in various forms within the prison system.\n\nIn December 2023, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed by journalist Sukanya Shantha, highlighting the prevalence of caste-based segregation and labor rules in Indian prisons. This litigation was prompted by a detailed investigation conducted by The Wire, which revealed that prison manuals in multiple states, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, contained provisions that sanctioned caste-based discrimination and forced labor. The investigation underscored that these manuals perpetuated a caste hierarchy, violating the prisoners' right to life with dignity.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India took note of the PIL and issued notices to 13 Indian states regarding the allegations of caste-based discrimination in prisons. In a landmark ruling, the Court declared that caste-based discrimination and the division of labor based on caste hierarchy were unconstitutional. The Court found that such practices not only contravened Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law, but also amounted to a form of untouchability, which is prohibited under Article 17.\n\nThe ruling marked a significant step towards addressing institutional biases within India's correctional system, as the Supreme Court invalidated several provisions in state prison manuals that upheld caste distinctions. This decision is seen as a crucial move towards ensuring that the rights and dignity of all prisoners are respected, regardless of their caste background.
