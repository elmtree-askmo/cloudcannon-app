    What measures has Hezbollah taken in response to the airstrikes?
answer: >-
    In response to the airstrikes conducted by Israel, Hezbollah has taken several measures, primarily characterized by retaliatory actions. Following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rocket strikes against Israeli positions, particularly targeting the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms. This escalation was framed by Hezbollah as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, Hezbollah expanded its military operations, firing rockets, missiles, and drones into Israel. This marked a significant increase in hostilities, as Hezbollah aimed to respond to Israeli airstrikes that targeted its assets in southern Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah sites in retaliation for the rocket fire, leading to a cycle of attacks between the two parties.\n\nThe situation escalated further, with Hezbollah's actions being part of a broader regional conflict involving Iran's support for both Hezbollah and Hamas. The ongoing exchanges of fire and airstrikes have resulted in significant destruction and casualties on both sides, particularly affecting civilian areas in Lebanon.\n\nIn summary, Hezbollah's measures in response to Israeli airstrikes have included launching retaliatory rocket attacks, increasing military engagement, and framing its actions within the context of regional solidarity with Palestinian groups.
