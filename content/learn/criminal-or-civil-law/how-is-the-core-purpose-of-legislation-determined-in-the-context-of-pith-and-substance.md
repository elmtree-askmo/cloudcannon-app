    How is the core purpose of legislation determined in the context of pith and substance?
answer: >-
    The core purpose of legislation in the context of the Doctrine of Pith and Substance is determined by examining the true nature and character of the law, rather than its superficial label or title. This doctrine is essential in constitutional law, particularly in federal systems, where jurisdictional overlaps may occur between different levels of government.\n\nTo ascertain the core purpose of legislation, courts engage in a careful analysis of the law's dominant purpose and its effects. This involves looking beyond the form of the legislation to understand its essence. The key steps in this process include:\n\n1. **Identifying the Dominant Purpose**: Courts assess what the primary aim of the legislation is. This requires a thorough examination of the legislative text, its context, and the issues it seeks to address.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Effects**: The impact of the legislation is also considered. Even if a law touches upon matters outside the jurisdiction of the enacting authority, it may still be valid if its core purpose falls within the legislative competence of that authority.\n\n3. **Ensuring Harmonious Interpretation**: The doctrine promotes a harmonious interpretation of legislative powers, ensuring that laws are evaluated based on their substantive intent rather than merely their formal categorization. This helps maintain the constitutional balance of powers between federal and provincial or state authorities.\n\n4. **Judicial Precedents**: Courts often rely on previous rulings and interpretations to guide their analysis. Significant cases where the doctrine has been applied provide a framework for understanding how to approach similar legislative challenges.\n\nIn summary, the Doctrine of Pith and Substance serves as a vital tool for courts to determine the true nature and purpose of legislation, ensuring that laws are evaluated based on their core intent and maintaining the integrity of the constitutional distribution of powers.
