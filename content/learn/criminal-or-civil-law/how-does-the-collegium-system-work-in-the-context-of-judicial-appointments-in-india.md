    How does the collegium system work in the context of judicial appointments in India?
answer: >-
    The collegium system in India is a method for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts. It is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but has evolved through a series of Supreme Court judgments, collectively known as the Three Judges Cases. Hereâ€™s how the system works:\n\n1. **Composition of the Collegium**: The Supreme Court Collegium is composed of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. For High Courts, the collegium consists of the Chief Justice of the respective High Court and the two senior-most judges of that court.\n\n2. **Recommendation Process**: The collegium recommends candidates for judicial appointments and transfers. The names of candidates for appointment to the Supreme Court are forwarded to the President of India, who formally appoints the judges. For High Courts, the recommendations are sent to the state government after approval from the Supreme Court Collegium.\n\n3. **Appointment of the Chief Justice**: The outgoing CJI typically recommends his successor, and this appointment is generally made based on seniority, a practice that has been followed since the supersession controversy of the 1970s.\n\n4. **Judicial Independence**: The collegium system is designed to maintain the independence of the judiciary by allowing existing judges to appoint their successors. However, it has faced criticism for lack of transparency and potential caste bias, as it does not adequately represent marginalized communities.\n\n5. **Challenges and Criticism**: The system has been criticized for its opacity and the lengthy process involved in judicial appointments, which can lead to delays. There have been calls for reform, including the introduction of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) through the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014, which aimed to create a more transparent selection process. However, the NJAC was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, reinstating the collegium system.\n\n6. **Current Status**: As of now, the collegium system remains the primary method for judicial appointments in India, despite ongoing debates about its effectiveness and calls for reform.\n\nIn summary, the collegium system is a significant aspect of India's judicial framework, aimed at preserving judicial independence while also facing scrutiny regarding its processes and inclusivity.
