    What are the different methods of acquiring title to territory?
answer: >-
    In international law, there are several recognized methods by which a state can acquire title to territory. These methods, often referred to as "modes of acquisition of territory," include:\n\n1. **Cession**: This is the transfer of territory from one state to another through mutual consent, typically formalized by a treaty. Cession is one of the most common and lawful methods of acquiring territory in contemporary international law.\n\n2. **Occupation**: This method involves a state taking control of territory that is not currently claimed or occupied by another state. The occupation must be effective and demonstrate the intention to establish sovereignty over the territory.\n\n3. **Accretion**: This refers to the gradual and natural addition of land to a stateâ€™s territory, often through processes such as sediment deposition by rivers or the emergence of land from the sea.\n\n4. **Subjugation**: Historically, this method involved the acquisition of territory through conquest or military force. While it was once a common practice, modern international law generally prohibits the acquisition of territory by force, emphasizing the principle of non-use of force.\n\n5. **Prescription**: This method allows a state to acquire territory through continuous and peaceful possession over a period of time, which can lead to the recognition of sovereignty by other states.\n\nThese methods reflect the evolution of international law and the increasing emphasis on lawful and consensual means of acquiring territory, moving away from the more aggressive practices of the past. Understanding these modes is crucial for resolving territorial disputes and recognizing state sovereignty in the international arena.
