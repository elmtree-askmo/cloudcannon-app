    What were the key reasons behind Arvind Kejriwal's bail case reaching the Supreme Court?
answer: >-
    The key reasons behind Arvind Kejriwal's bail case reaching the Supreme Court primarily revolve around his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the alleged corruption linked to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. Here are the significant factors that contributed to this legal development:\n\n1. **Duration of Custody**: Kejriwal had been in custody for over 90 days, which the Supreme Court noted as a significant factor in its decision to grant bail. The court emphasized that "mere interrogation does not justify arrest," indicating that the length of his detention was a concern.\n\n2. **Judicial Scrutiny of Arrest**: The Supreme Court's ruling highlighted a split opinion among the justices regarding the validity of Kejriwal's arrest. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan expressed that the CBI's actions raised more questions than answers, particularly noting that the agency had not deemed it necessary to arrest him for over 22 months prior to his detention.\n\n3. **Conditions for Bail**: The Supreme Court granted bail but imposed five conditions, including barring Kejriwal from entering his office and signing files. This reflects the court's attempt to balance the need for accountability with the rights of an elected official.\n\n4. **Ongoing Legal Proceedings**: The court acknowledged that the completion of the trial was unlikely to occur in the immediate future, which further justified the decision to grant bail. This consideration is crucial in cases where prolonged detention may not be warranted.\n\n5. **Political Context**: The case has significant political implications, as Kejriwal is a prominent political figure and the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The timing of his arrest, particularly in relation to his previous bail in a separate case, raised suspicions about the motivations behind the CBI's actions.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to Arvind Kejriwal was influenced by the duration of his custody, the nature of the arrest, the ongoing legal proceedings, and the political context surrounding the case.
