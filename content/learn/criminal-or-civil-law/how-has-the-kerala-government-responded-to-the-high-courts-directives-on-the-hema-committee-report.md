    How has the Kerala government responded to the High Court's directives on the Hema Committee report?
answer: >-
    The Kerala government has faced significant criticism from the Kerala High Court regarding its response to the Justice Hema Committee report, which addresses allegations of sexual harassment and abuse within the Malayalam film industry. The High Court has described the government's response as "alarmingly lethargic" and has expressed frustration over the lack of legal action taken based on the report's findings.\n\nIn recent directives, the High Court has instructed the state government to present the entire Hema Committee report, including any redacted portions, in a sealed cover. Additionally, the court has mandated that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) involved in probing the allegations submit a report detailing the actions taken by a nominated nodal officer by the next hearing, scheduled for December 11. This indicates a push for accountability and a more proactive approach from the state government in addressing the serious issues highlighted in the report.\n\nThe court's involvement has also extended to the Kerala State Women's Commission, which is now part of the proceedings, emphasizing the importance of addressing the concerns raised in the Hema Committee report comprehensively. The High Court has made it clear that if any cognizable offenses are disclosed in the report, it will be the court's responsibility to determine whether criminal action is warranted.\n\nOverall, the Kerala government's response has been characterized by inaction, prompting the High Court to take a more active role in ensuring that the findings of the Hema Committee are thoroughly investigated and addressed.
