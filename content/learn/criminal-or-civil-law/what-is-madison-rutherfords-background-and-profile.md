    What is Madison Rutherford's background and profile?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford, also known by the aliases John Patrick Sankey and Thomas Bay Hamilton, is a notable figure in the realm of financial crime, particularly for his involvement in an elaborate insurance fraud scheme. He was a financial adviser based in Bethel, Connecticut, who gained notoriety for faking his own death in a bid to collect $7 million in insurance funds.\n\nIn 1998, news broke that Rutherford had died in a fiery automobile accident, which was later revealed to be part of his fraudulent plan. Following the incident, forensic investigations uncovered skeletal remains and other evidence that contradicted the narrative of his death. Notably, forensic expert William M. Bass analyzed the remains and found inconsistencies, such as teeth that did not match those of a Caucasian person and skull fragments belonging to someone older than 34, raising suspicions about the authenticity of the supposed accident.\n\nRutherford's scheme involved not only faking his death but also identity theft, as he assumed a new identity after serving time in federal prison for his fraud convictions. He was sentenced to five years for his actions, which included the use of a dead body and a truck fire to stage his demise. After his release, he adopted the name "Bey" and opened a sports bar in Columbia, South Carolina, seemingly attempting to start anew.\n\nThe case of Madison Rutherford serves as a stark reminder of the lengths to which individuals may go driven by greed and the complexities involved in forensic investigations of financial crimes. His story highlights the intersection of identity deception, forensic anthropology, and the impact of financial fraud on victims and society at large.
