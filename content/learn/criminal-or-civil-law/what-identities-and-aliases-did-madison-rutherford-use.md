    What identities and aliases did Madison Rutherford use?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford, whose real name was John Patrick Sankey, used several identities and aliases throughout his life, particularly during his fraudulent activities. After serving a prison sentence for larceny in 1993, he legally changed his name to Madison Rutherford. In addition to this name, he also adopted the alias "Bey" after his release from prison, which he used when he opened Bey's Sports Bar in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nRutherford's use of presidential-sounding names, such as Madison Rutherford and Hamilton, was noted by investigators, highlighting his tendency to create identities that conveyed a sense of authority or respectability. This pattern of adopting new identities was part of his broader strategy to defraud clients and evade legal consequences. His actions culminated in a scheme where he faked his own death in an attempt to collect $7 million in insurance money, further demonstrating his deceptive practices.
