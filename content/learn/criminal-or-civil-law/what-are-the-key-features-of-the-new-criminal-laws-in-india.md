    What are the key features of the new criminal laws in India?
answer: >-
    The new criminal laws in India, which include the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) 2023, represent a significant overhaul of the Indian criminal justice system. These laws are set to come into effect on July 1, 2024, replacing the colonial-era Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) of 1973, and the Indian Evidence Act of 1872. Here are the key features of these new laws:\n\n1. **Modernization of Legal Framework**: The new laws aim to modernize the criminal justice system to address contemporary challenges and streamline judicial processes.\n\n2. **Fast-Track Investigations**: There is a strong emphasis on timely investigations, particularly for offenses against women and children, which must be completed within two months of recording information.\n\n3. **Electronic Evidence**: The BSA acknowledges the importance of electronic evidence, allowing for the inclusion of information produced or transmitted by devices that can store or recover data.\n\n4. **People-Friendly Police Procedures**: The laws introduce provisions such as Zero FIR (First Information Report), online registration of police complaints, and electronic summonses. These changes are designed to make the police investigation process more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n5. **Mandatory Forensic and Videography Protocols**: For all heinous crimes, there is a requirement for mandatory videography and forensic team visits to crime scenes, enhancing the quality of evidence collected.\n\n6. **Plea Bargaining**: The new laws include time-bound provisions for plea bargaining, allowing applications to be made within 30 days from the date of framing of charges, which aims to reduce overcrowding in jails.\n\n7. **Technological Integration**: The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) software has undergone modifications to align with the new laws, and several mobile applications have been developed to facilitate the transition, including e-Sakshya for electronically capturing evidence and e-Summons for electronic delivery of court summonses.\n\n8. **Victim-Centric Approach**: The new laws prioritize the rights and needs of victims, aiming to enhance their experience within the criminal justice system.\n\nThese reforms are a landmark move in India's legal history, reflecting a shift towards a more efficient, modern, and victim-oriented criminal justice system.
