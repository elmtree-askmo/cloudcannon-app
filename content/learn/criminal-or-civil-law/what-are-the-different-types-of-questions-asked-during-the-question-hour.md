    What are the different types of questions asked during the Question Hour?
answer: >-
    During the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, which is the first hour of a sitting session, Members of Parliament (MPs) can raise questions regarding various aspects of administrative activities. There are four distinct types of questions that can be asked during this time:\n\n1. **Starred Questions**: These questions are marked with an asterisk and require an oral answer from the minister. MPs can ask supplementary questions based on the minister's response.\n\n2. **Unstarred Questions**: Unlike starred questions, unstarred questions do not require an oral answer. Instead, they receive a written response from the minister. These questions are typically used for inquiries that do not necessitate immediate discussion.\n\n3. **Short Notice Questions**: These questions are asked with less than fifteen days' notice and require an oral answer. MPs must provide reasons for the urgency of these questions, allowing for immediate attention to pressing issues.\n\n4. **Questions to Private Members**: These questions are directed towards private members of the Parliament rather than government ministers. They can also be asked during the Question Hour, although they are less common.\n\nThese types of questions serve as a vital tool for parliamentary oversight, holding the government accountable for its actions and decisions.
