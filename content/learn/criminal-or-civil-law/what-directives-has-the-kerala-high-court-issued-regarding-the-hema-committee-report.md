    What directives has the Kerala High Court issued regarding the Hema Committee report?
answer: >-
    The Kerala High Court has issued several directives regarding the Hema Committee report, which was formed to investigate allegations of sexual harassment and abuse within the Malayalam film industry. Here are the key directives:\n\n1. **Submission of the Report**: The Kerala High Court has directed the State Government to present the entire Justice Hema Committee Report, including any redacted portions, before the court in a sealed cover. This directive emphasizes the court's intention to review the full report to determine if any cognizable offenses are disclosed.\n\n2. **Involvement of the Kerala State Women's Commission**: The court has taken steps to involve the Kerala State Women's Commission in the proceedings, indicating a collaborative approach to addressing the issues raised in the report.\n\n3. **Special Investigation Team (SIT) Directives**: The court has instructed the SIT, which is probing offenses related to the report, to nominate a nodal officer. This officer is tasked with preventing alleged intimidation of individuals involved in the investigation.\n\n4. **Reporting Requirements**: The SIT is also required to submit a report detailing the actions taken by the nominated nodal officer at the next hearing, which is scheduled for December 11, 2024. This requirement aims to ensure accountability and transparency in the investigation process.\n\n5. **Criticism of Government Response**: The Kerala High Court has criticized the state government for its "alarmingly lethargic" response to the Hema Committee report, highlighting the need for prompt action in addressing the serious allegations of sexual misconduct within the film industry.\n\nThese directives reflect the court's commitment to ensuring that the findings of the Hema Committee are thoroughly examined and that appropriate actions are taken in response to the allegations of sexual exploitation and harassment.
