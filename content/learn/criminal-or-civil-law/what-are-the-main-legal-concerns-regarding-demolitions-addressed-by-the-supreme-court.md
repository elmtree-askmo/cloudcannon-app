    What are the main legal concerns regarding demolitions addressed by the Supreme Court?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India has addressed significant legal concerns regarding property demolitions, particularly in the context of what has been termed "bulldozer justice." This term refers to the practice where state authorities demolish the homes of individuals accused of crimes, often without following due legal processes. Here are the main legal concerns highlighted by the Supreme Court:\n\n1. **Violation of Due Process**: The Supreme Court has ruled that demolishing a person's home based solely on their alleged criminal history is unlawful and unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that the state cannot act as a vigilante, replacing legal processes with arbitrary punitive measures. This practice undermines the principle of due process, which is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, guaranteeing the right to life, dignity, and shelter.\n\n2. **Separation of Powers**: The Court pointed out that such demolitions violate the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers. Only the judiciary has the authority to determine guilt, and state authorities cannot assume this role by demolishing properties of accused individuals.\n\n3. **Guidelines for Demolitions**: In response to these concerns, the Supreme Court has laid down comprehensive guidelines to regulate the exercise of demolition powers by authorities. These guidelines include:\n   - A mandatory notice period of at least 15 days before any demolition.\n   - The requirement for video recording of the demolition process.\n   - Public display of demolition orders to ensure transparency.\n   - Accountability measures for officials involved in the demolition process.\n\n4. **Exemptions**: The guidelines do not apply to unauthorized structures on public roads, railway lines, footpaths, or water bodies, nor to cases where there are existing court orders for demolition. However, the Court has mandated that individuals must have the opportunity to challenge demolition orders.\n\n5. **Accountability of Officials**: The Supreme Court has stressed the importance of holding public officials accountable for arbitrary demolitions, which can render families homeless and destitute overnight.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court's rulings aim to curb the misuse of demolition powers by state authorities and ensure that individuals' rights are protected in accordance with the law.
