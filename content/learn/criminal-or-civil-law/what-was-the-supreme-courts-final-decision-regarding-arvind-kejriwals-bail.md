    What was the Supreme Court's final decision regarding Arvind Kejriwal's bail?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India granted bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a corruption case related to the alleged excise policy scam. This decision was made by a two-judge bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan. The court's ruling came after Kejriwal had been in custody for nearly six months, following his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\n\nWhile Justice Surya Kant upheld the validity of Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan described it as "unjustified," indicating a split in the bench's opinion regarding the circumstances of the arrest. The Supreme Court's decision to grant bail was based on the observation that the completion of the trial was unlikely to occur in the immediate future and that Kejriwal met the necessary conditions for bail.\n\nHowever, the court imposed several conditions on his bail, including a prohibition on entering the Chief Minister's office and signing official documents. This ruling reflects the ongoing legal challenges faced by Kejriwal in connection with the excise policy case, which has been a significant political issue in Delhi.
