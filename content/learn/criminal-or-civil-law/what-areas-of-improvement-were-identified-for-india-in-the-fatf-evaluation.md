    What areas of improvement were identified for India in the FATF evaluation?
answer: >-
    The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducted a mutual evaluation of India for the period 2023-24, which resulted in a report adopted during the FATF plenary held in Singapore in June 2024. While India was recognized for achieving a "high level of technical compliance" and was placed in the "regular follow-up" category, there were still areas identified for improvement.\n\nThe key areas requiring improvement included:\n\n1. **Public Consultation on Money Laundering National Risk Assessment**: India was found to be partially compliant in this area. It is essential for the country to enhance its public consultation processes regarding the updates to the national risk assessment guidance related to money laundering.\n\n2. **Completion of Trials and Sanctions**: The FATF emphasized the need for India to ensure that money laundering and terrorist financing trials are completed efficiently and that offenders face appropriate sanctions. This is crucial for the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) framework.\n\n3. **Risk-Based Approach with Non-Profit Organizations**: The FATF recommended that India adopt a more risk-based and educative approach when dealing with non-profit organizations to prevent misuse for money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nOverall, while India has made significant strides in its AML/CFT framework, these areas highlight the need for ongoing improvements to adapt to the evolving financial landscape and to ensure compliance with international standards.
