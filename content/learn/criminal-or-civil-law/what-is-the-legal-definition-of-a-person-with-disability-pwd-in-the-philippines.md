    What is the legal definition of a 'Person With Disability' (PWD) in the Philippines?
answer: >-
    In the Philippines, the legal definition of a "Person With Disability" (PWD) is outlined in the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities, also known as Republic Act No. 7277, which was enacted on March 24, 1992. This law aims to protect and promote the rights and welfare of individuals with disabilities in the country.\n\nAccording to the Magna Carta, a PWD is defined as "any person who has a physical, mental, or sensory impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." This definition encompasses a wide range of disabilities, ensuring that individuals who experience various forms of impairment are recognized and entitled to specific rights and benefits.\n\nThe law has been amended by Republic Act No. 10754, which further expands the benefits and privileges available to PWDs, including discounts and exemptions in various sectors such as education, health, and transportation. The legislation emphasizes the importance of integrating PWDs into society and ensuring their full participation in all aspects of life.\n\nOverall, the legal framework in the Philippines aims to uplift and empower persons with disabilities, counter discrimination, and promote equality within the community.
