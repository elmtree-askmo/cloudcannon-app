    What is the difference between a deed and a title in real estate?
answer: >-
    The difference between a deed and a title in real estate is fundamental to understanding property ownership and transfer. \n\nA **deed** is a legal document that serves as evidence of the transfer of ownership of real property from one party (the grantor) to another (the grantee). It contains essential information such as the names of the parties involved, a legal description of the property, and the signatures of the individuals transferring the property. The deed is the physical instrument that conveys the title, and it must be filed with the appropriate government authority to be legally recognized.\n\nOn the other hand, a **title** refers to the legal right to own and use a property. It is a concept that signifies ownership rather than a physical document. When a property is sold, the title is transferred from the seller to the buyer through the deed. The person who holds the title has the legal ownership and the right to possess the property.\n\nIn summary, while a deed is the document that facilitates the transfer of ownership, the title represents the actual ownership rights to the property. Understanding this distinction is crucial for anyone involved in real estate transactions.
