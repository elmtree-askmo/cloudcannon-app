    What is high-low mediation, and how does it differ from other mediation techniques?
answer: >-
    High-low mediation is a specific technique used in the mediation process that establishes a predetermined range for settlement amounts. In a high-low agreement, the parties involved agree on a minimum recovery amount for the plaintiff (the "low") and a maximum payout amount for the defendant (the "high"). This arrangement allows the parties to proceed with mediation or further dispute resolution (such as litigation or arbitration) while ensuring that the final settlement will fall within this agreed range.\n\nThe key features of high-low mediation include:\n\n1. **Risk Control**: By setting a minimum and maximum amount, both parties can limit their exposure to extreme outcomes. The plaintiff is guaranteed a minimum recovery, while the defendant knows they will not have to pay more than a certain amount, which can help in managing financial risks.\n\n2. **Partial Settlement**: High-low agreements represent a form of partial settlement, allowing the parties to agree on certain terms while still leaving other aspects of the dispute unresolved. This can facilitate negotiations and encourage parties to reach a resolution.\n\n3. **Binding Mediation Context**: In some cases, high-low agreements can be used in binding mediation, where the mediator has the authority to make decisions if the parties cannot reach an agreement. This adds an additional layer of certainty to the process.\n\nHigh-low mediation differs from other mediation techniques, such as facilitative, evaluative, or transformative mediation, in that it explicitly defines the financial parameters of a settlement. While traditional mediation focuses on facilitating communication and negotiation between parties without imposing solutions, high-low mediation provides a structured framework that can help parties feel more secure in their negotiations.\n\nOverall, high-low mediation is a valuable tool for parties looking to manage risk and reach a settlement while still allowing for the possibility of further dispute resolution if necessary.
