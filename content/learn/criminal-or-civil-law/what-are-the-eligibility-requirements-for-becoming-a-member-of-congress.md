    What are the eligibility requirements for becoming a member of Congress?
answer: >-
    To become a member of the United States Congress, individuals must meet specific eligibility requirements as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. These requirements differ for the two chambers of Congress: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n### House of Representatives\nAccording to Article I, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution, the qualifications to serve as a U.S. Representative are as follows:\n- **Age**: Must be at least 25 years old.\n- **Citizenship**: Must have been a citizen of the United States for at least 7 years.\n- **Residency**: Must be an inhabitant of the state from which they are elected at the time of election.\n\n### Senate\nFor the Senate, the requirements are more stringent, as specified in Article I, Section 3, Clause 2:\n- **Age**: Must be at least 30 years old.\n- **Citizenship**: Must have been a citizen of the United States for at least 9 years.\n- **Residency**: Must be an inhabitant of the state from which they are elected at the time of election.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- The post-Civil War Fourteenth Amendment prohibits any person who has taken an oath to support the Constitution and later engaged in rebellion or aided an enemy of the U.S. from serving in either chamber of Congress.\n- It is important to note that while residency is required at the time of election, Congress has interpreted the qualifications to mean that age and citizenship must be met when the member-elect is sworn in.\n\nThese constitutional qualifications ensure that members of Congress possess a certain level of maturity and experience, reflecting the Framers' intent to create a legislative body that is both representative and capable of making informed decisions.
