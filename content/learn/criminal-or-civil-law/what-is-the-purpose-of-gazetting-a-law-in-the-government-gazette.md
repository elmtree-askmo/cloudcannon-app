    What is the purpose of gazetting a law in the Government Gazette?
answer: >-
    The purpose of gazetting a law in the Government Gazette is to officially publish and notify the public about newly enacted laws. This process is crucial because an Act does not come into operation until it is gazetted, meaning that the public is formally informed of the new law and its provisions. The Government Gazette serves as the official publication of the Singapore government, containing important legal documents, notices, and announcements.\n\nWhen a Bill is gazetted, it includes essential information such as the date the law takes effect, which is typically the date of publication unless specified otherwise in the Act. This ensures that citizens are aware of their rights and obligations under the law, as the gazetting process makes the law legally binding and enforceable. Furthermore, the Gazette provides a record of legislative history, including the commencement date of the Act, which is published just below its Long Title.\n\nIn summary, gazetting is a vital step in the legislative process that ensures transparency and public awareness of legal changes, thereby reinforcing the principle that ignorance of the law is not an excuse for non-compliance.
