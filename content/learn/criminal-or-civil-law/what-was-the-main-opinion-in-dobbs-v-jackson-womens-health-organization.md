    What was the main opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization?
answer: >-
    In the landmark case of **Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization**, decided on June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. This decision effectively overruled both **Roe v. Wade** (1973) and **Planned Parenthood v. Casey** (1992), which had previously established and affirmed a constitutional right to obtain an abortion prior to fetal viability.\n\nThe Court's majority opinion emphasized that the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the states and their elected representatives. The justices argued that linking abortion to a right to personal autonomy could lead to the recognition of other rights that might be deemed controversial, such as those related to illicit drug use or prostitution. As a result, the Court determined that abortion is not a fundamental right, and thus, state regulations regarding abortion would be evaluated under a rational-basis review standard.\n\nThe ruling was based on the historical context of abortion laws in the United States, noting that at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, a significant majority of states had criminalized abortion at any stage of pregnancy. The Court acknowledged that different states may weigh the interests of "potential life" against a woman's desire for an abortion differently than the federal judiciary.\n\nOverall, the **Dobbs** decision marked a significant shift in the legal landscape surrounding reproductive rights in the United States, allowing states to impose stricter regulations or outright bans on abortion, thereby altering the rights and access to reproductive healthcare for women across the country.
