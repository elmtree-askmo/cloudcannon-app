    What fundamental rights are violated by caste-based labor in Indian prisons?
answer: >-
    Caste-based labor in Indian prisons violates several fundamental rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution. The primary rights affected include:\n\n1. **Right to Equality (Article 14)**: Caste-based discrimination inherently violates the principle of equality before the law. The segregation of prisoners and the allocation of work based on caste hierarchy create an unequal environment that discriminates against lower-caste individuals.\n\n2. **Prohibition of Untouchability (Article 17)**: The practice of caste-based labor in prisons is tantamount to untouchability, which is explicitly prohibited under Article 17 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has recognized that caste-based discrimination and the treatment of inmates from marginalized communities as "habitual offenders" are oppressive to human dignity.\n\n3. **Right to Dignity (Article 21)**: The Supreme Court has ruled that caste-based discrimination in prisons violates the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to live with dignity. The imposition of degrading tasks on lower-caste prisoners undermines their dignity and humanity.\n\n4. **Protection from Forced Labor (Article 23)**: Caste-based labor practices can be seen as a form of forced labor, which is prohibited under Article 23 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has mandated an end to such practices, recognizing them as a violation of this right.\n\n5. **Right to Freedom from Discrimination (Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955)**: This act specifically addresses discrimination based on caste and reinforces the constitutional mandate against caste-based discrimination.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent rulings have highlighted the need to abolish caste-based segregation and discriminatory work allocation in prisons, emphasizing that such practices not only violate fundamental rights but also perpetuate systemic inequalities rooted in the caste system.
