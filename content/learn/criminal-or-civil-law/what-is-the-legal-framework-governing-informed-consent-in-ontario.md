    What is the legal framework governing informed consent in Ontario?
answer: >-
    The legal framework governing informed consent in Ontario is primarily established by the **Health Care Consent Act, 1996 (HCCA)** and the **Mental Health Act (MHA)**. These pieces of legislation outline the rights of individuals regarding their healthcare decisions and the processes that healthcare professionals must follow to obtain consent.\n\n1. **Health Care Consent Act, 1996**: This act emphasizes the principle of autonomy, asserting that every person has the right to determine what will be done to their body. Informed consent requires that a client be capable of providing consent, which means they must understand the information provided to them regarding their treatment options. The act mandates that consent must be obtained from the client or their authorized representative on an ongoing basis. If a healthcare practitioner determines that a person is incapable of making a decision about treatment, consent must be obtained from a substitute decision-maker (SDM).\n\n2. **Mental Health Act**: This act governs the treatment of individuals with mental health issues and includes specific provisions for voluntary, informal, and involuntary admissions to psychiatric care. It also outlines the rights of patients in mental health settings, including the requirement for informed consent.\n\n3. **Substitute Decision-Makers**: If a patient is deemed incapable of providing informed consent, the healthcare provider must seek consent from an SDM. The HCCA provides a hierarchy of who can act as an SDM, which includes family members and legally appointed representatives.\n\n4. **Ongoing Process**: Informed consent is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. Healthcare professionals are required to ensure that patients are continuously informed about their treatment options and any changes in their condition that may affect their decisions.\n\n5. **Legal Implications**: Healthcare practitioners must ensure that they respect the rights of patients to refuse treatment when capable. In emergency situations, if a patient is incapable and has previously expressed a wish to refuse treatment, healthcare providers must honor that wish unless immediate action is necessary to prevent serious harm.\n\nIn summary, the legal framework for informed consent in Ontario is designed to protect patient autonomy while ensuring that healthcare providers follow a structured process to obtain consent, particularly when patients are incapable of making decisions for themselves. For more detailed information, the full text of the Health Care Consent Act can be accessed through Ontario's legislative resources.
