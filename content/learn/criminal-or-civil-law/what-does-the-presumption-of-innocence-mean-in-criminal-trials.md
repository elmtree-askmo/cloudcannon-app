    What does the presumption of innocence mean in criminal trials?
answer: >-
    The presumption of innocence is a fundamental legal principle in criminal law that asserts that every person accused of a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty. This principle is crucial for ensuring a fair trial and protecting individuals from wrongful convictions. \n\nUnder the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. This means that it is the responsibility of the prosecution to present compelling evidence to convince the judge or jury of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecution fails to meet this burden, the defendant must be acquitted of the charges.\n\nThe presumption of innocence is not merely a formality; it is a substantive legal doctrine that underpins the justice system. It serves to protect individuals from arbitrary punishment and ensures that the state must substantiate its accusations with credible evidence. The principle is enshrined in various legal systems and has been affirmed in numerous court cases, including landmark decisions by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nWhile the presumption of innocence is a cornerstone of criminal justice, it is important to note that it does not guarantee that a defendant will remain free while awaiting trial. Defendants may be held in pre-trial detention, depending on the circumstances of their case.\n\nIn summary, the presumption of innocence is a vital legal safeguard that upholds the rights of the accused and reinforces the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty.
