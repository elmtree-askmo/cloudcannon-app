    What charges were brought against Madison Rutherford and what was the sentencing?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford faced serious charges for his involvement in an elaborate insurance fraud scheme. He was accused of faking his own death in order to collect approximately $7 million in insurance benefits. Specifically, he conspired with his wife to claim $4 million in death benefits from the Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company and an additional $3 million from other insurance policies. \n\nThe investigation revealed that the human remains found in the car that was supposedly involved in his death did not belong to him, but rather to a 50-year-old Native American. This led to further scrutiny and ultimately to his arrest.\n\nIn federal court, Rutherford pleaded guilty to the charges against him. As a result, he was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the fraud. This case highlights the severe legal consequences of financial crimes and the lengths to which individuals may go to deceive insurance companies.
