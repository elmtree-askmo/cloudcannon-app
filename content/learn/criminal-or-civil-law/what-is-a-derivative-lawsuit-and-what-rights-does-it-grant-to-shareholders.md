    What is a derivative lawsuit, and what rights does it grant to shareholders?
answer: >-
    A derivative lawsuit, also known as a derivative action, is a legal mechanism that allows shareholders to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the corporation against third parties, typically when the corporation's directors or management fail to take action against wrongdoing that harms the corporation. This type of lawsuit is essential for holding directors accountable and ensuring that they act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.\n\n### Rights Granted to Shareholders in a Derivative Lawsuit\n\nTo initiate a derivative lawsuit, shareholders must meet specific criteria, which include:\n\n1. **Shareholder Status**: The individual must have been a shareholder of the corporation at the time of the alleged wrongdoing. This ensures that the person bringing the lawsuit has a vested interest in the corporation's welfare.\n\n2. **Adequate Representation**: The shareholder must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the corporation. This means that the shareholder should act in a manner that benefits the corporation as a whole, rather than pursuing personal interests.\n\n3. **Written Demand**: The shareholder must make a written demand on the corporation to take suitable action regarding the alleged wrongdoing. This demand is a formal request for the corporation to address the issue, and it must be made regardless of whether the complaint is against a third party or insiders, such as directors or corporate officers.\n\n4. **Response Time**: If the corporation rejects the demand or fails to respond within 90 days, the shareholder may proceed with the derivative lawsuit. This timeframe allows the corporation an opportunity to investigate and potentially rectify the situation before litigation ensues.\n\n5. **Futility Exception**: In some cases, a shareholder may be excused from making a demand if it would be futile. For example, if the directors themselves are accused of wrongdoing, it may be unreasonable to expect them to take action against themselves. In such cases, the futility exception applies, allowing the shareholder to bypass the demand requirement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDerivative lawsuits serve as a critical tool for shareholders to protect their interests and ensure that corporate governance is upheld. By allowing shareholders to take action when directors fail to do so, derivative lawsuits help maintain accountability within the corporation and safeguard the rights of shareholders.
