    What legal precedents were set by the cases Tape v. Hurley and United States v. Wong Kim Ark?
answer: >-
    The cases of **Tape v. Hurley** (1884) and **United States v. Wong Kim Ark** (1898) are significant legal precedents in the context of Chinese-American history and immigration law.\n\n### Tape v. Hurley (1884)\nIn **Tape v. Hurley**, the California Supreme Court ruled that a Chinese-American child, Mamie Tape, had the right to attend a public school in San Francisco. The case arose when the school denied her admission based on her race. The court held that the exclusion of Mamie Tape from the public school violated the California Constitution, which mandated that public schools be open to all children regardless of race. This case set a precedent for the rights of Asian American children to access public education and highlighted the legal challenges against racial discrimination in educational institutions.\n\n### United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898)\n**United States v. Wong Kim Ark** was a landmark Supreme Court case that affirmed the principle of birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. Wong Kim Ark, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant parents, was denied re-entry into the United States after a trip to China, based on the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Supreme Court ruled that he was a U.S. citizen by birthright, as the Fourteenth Amendment grants citizenship to all persons born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' nationality. This decision established a crucial legal precedent affirming the citizenship rights of individuals born in the U.S., including those of Chinese descent, and countered the restrictive immigration policies of the time.\n\n### Summary\nBoth cases played pivotal roles in shaping the legal landscape for Chinese Americans and contributed to the broader discourse on civil rights and immigration in the United States. Tape v. Hurley emphasized the importance of educational access free from racial discrimination, while United States v. Wong Kim Ark reinforced the principle of birthright citizenship, challenging the exclusionary practices of the era. Together, they laid foundational legal precedents that would influence future civil rights cases and the treatment of Asian Americans in the U.S. legal system.
