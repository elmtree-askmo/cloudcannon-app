    What is meant by collective responsibilities in a parliamentary government?
answer: >-
    In a parliamentary government, "collective responsibility" refers to a constitutional convention whereby all members of the cabinet are required to publicly support decisions made by the government, even if they do not personally agree with those decisions. This principle is a cornerstone of the Westminster system and serves to ensure that the government presents a united front to the legislature, the monarch, and the public.\n\nKey aspects of collective responsibility include:\n\n1. **Unified Support**: Cabinet members must support government decisions in public forums, including Parliament. This means that even if a minister disagrees with a decision, they are expected to uphold it publicly.\n\n2. **Confidential Discussions**: While ministers can express their views and disagreements during cabinet meetings, they must present a unified stance once a decision is made. This allows for open discussion within the cabinet while maintaining a cohesive public image.\n\n3. **Accountability**: Collective responsibility binds the cabinet together, making all members accountable for the actions and decisions of the government. If the government loses the confidence of the legislature, it may lead to a vote of no confidence, which can result in the resignation of the entire cabinet.\n\n4. **Legal vs. Conventional**: In some countries, such as India, collective responsibility is enshrined in law (Article 75 of the Indian Constitution), whereas in others, like the United Kingdom, it is primarily a convention without legal backing.\n\n5. **Ministerial Code**: In the UK, the Ministerial Code and the Cabinet Manual outline the expectations and rules regarding collective responsibility, reinforcing the importance of this principle in maintaining government integrity and accountability.\n\nOverall, collective responsibility is essential for the functioning of a parliamentary system, as it fosters unity and accountability within the government, ensuring that it operates effectively and maintains public trust.
