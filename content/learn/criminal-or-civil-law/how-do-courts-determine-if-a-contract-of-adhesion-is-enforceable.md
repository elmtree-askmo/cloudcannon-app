    How do courts determine if a contract of adhesion is enforceable?
answer: >-
    Courts determine the enforceability of contracts of adhesion through a careful examination of their terms and the circumstances under which they were formed. Here are the key factors that courts consider:\n\n1. **Bargaining Power**: Adhesion contracts are typically formed between parties of unequal bargaining power, where one party (usually the consumer) has little to no ability to negotiate the terms. Courts assess whether this imbalance is significant enough to warrant scrutiny of the contract.\n\n2. **Unconscionability**: Courts look for terms that may be deemed unconscionable, meaning they are excessively one-sided or oppressive to the adhering party. If a contract contains such terms, a court may refuse to enforce those specific provisions or the entire contract.\n\n3. **Reasonable Expectations**: The doctrine of reasonable expectations plays a crucial role. This doctrine states that a party should not be bound by terms that they would not have reasonably expected to be included in the contract. If the adhering party could not have anticipated certain terms, those terms may be deemed unenforceable.\n\n4. **Transparency and Clarity**: The clarity and transparency of the contract terms are also critical. Courts scrutinize whether the terms are presented in a clear and understandable manner. Hidden or ambiguous clauses can lead to a finding of unenforceability.\n\n5. **Judicial Review for Fairness**: Courts conduct a substantive review of adhesion contracts to ensure fairness. This review may involve striking out particularly egregious terms or voiding the contract entirely if it does not meet standards of fair play.\n\n6. **Context of Use**: The context in which the adhesion contract is used can also influence its enforceability. For example, online contracts, such as browse-wrap agreements, may be less likely to be enforced if the terms are not clearly presented or easily accessible.\n\nIn summary, while contracts of adhesion are generally enforceable, courts apply a rigorous standard to ensure that the terms are fair and that the adhering party had a meaningful choice in accepting them. If the terms are found to be unconscionable or if the adhering party's reasonable expectations are not met, the court may rule the contract or specific provisions within it as unenforceable.
