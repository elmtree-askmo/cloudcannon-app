    How does the NJAC differ from the collegium system?
answer: >-
    The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) and the Collegium system represent two distinct approaches to the appointment of judges in India.\n\n1. **Composition**:\n   - **Collegium System**: This system is composed of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. They recommend appointments and transfers of judges to the higher judiciary.\n   - **NJAC**: Proposed to be a six-member body, the NJAC would include the CJI as the ex officio Chairperson, two senior-most Supreme Court judges as ex officio members, the Union Minister of Law and Justice as an ex officio member, and two eminent persons from civil society. One of these civil society members would be nominated by a committee consisting of the CJI, Prime Minister, and the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, while the other would be nominated from underrepresented communities or women.\n\n2. **Criteria for Recommendations**:\n   - **Collegium System**: The recommendations for appointments are primarily based on seniority and the discretion of the judges within the collegium.\n   - **NJAC**: The NJAC was intended to recommend judges based on ability, merit, and other criteria specified in regulations, thus introducing a more structured approach to the selection process.\n\n3. **Judicial Independence**:\n   - **Collegium System**: This system is often defended as a means to maintain judicial independence, as it limits political influence in judicial appointments.\n   - **NJAC**: Critics of the NJAC argued that it could undermine judicial independence by allowing political figures to have a significant role in the appointment process, as it included members from the executive branch.\n\n4. **Legal Status**:\n   - The NJAC was established through the 99th Constitutional Amendment and the NJAC Act in 2014. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, reaffirming the Collegium system as the law of the land. The court's decision emphasized the need to preserve the independence of the judiciary from political interference.\n\nIn summary, the NJAC aimed to create a more inclusive and merit-based system for judicial appointments, while the Collegium system emphasizes judicial independence and the primacy of senior judges in the selection process. The Supreme Court's rejection of the NJAC underscores the ongoing debate about the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive in India.
