    How did the Supreme Court respond to the allegations regarding Tirupati Laddus?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India responded to the allegations regarding the Tirupati Laddus by questioning the credibility of the claims made by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. During hearings related to a batch of petitions seeking a court-monitored investigation into the alleged use of adulterated ghee, the Supreme Court criticized Naidu for making public statements about the use of animal fat in the preparation of the laddus without providing conclusive evidence. The court emphasized that "at least the Gods should be kept out of politics" and sought proof for the allegations made.\n\nIn response to the controversy, the Supreme Court ordered the formation of an independent Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the claims. The court highlighted the need for the investigation to address the concerns and sentiments of millions of devotees, stating that the issue should not be politicized. The SIT was tasked with conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations of adulteration in the preparation of the famous prasadam offered at the Tirumala Tirupati Temple.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court's intervention aimed to ensure that the investigation was conducted fairly and transparently, while also protecting the religious sentiments of devotees associated with the Tirupati Laddus.
