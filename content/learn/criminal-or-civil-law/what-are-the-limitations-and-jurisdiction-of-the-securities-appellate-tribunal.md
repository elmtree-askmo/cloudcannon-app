    What are the limitations and jurisdiction of the Securities Appellate Tribunal?
answer: >-
    The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) is a statutory body established under Section 15K of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. It is tasked with hearing and disposing of appeals against orders passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or by an adjudicating officer under the Act. \n\n### Limitations of SAT\n1. **Time Limit for Appeals**: An appeal must be filed within 45 days from the date on which a copy of the order made by SEBI or the adjudicating officer is received by the appellant. This limitation is prescribed under Section 15W of the SEBI Act, 1992.\n\n2. **Scope of Jurisdiction**: The SAT has jurisdiction over matters specifically conferred upon it by the SEBI Act or any other law in force. This means that it can only hear appeals related to orders made by SEBI or adjudicating officers under the provisions of the SEBI Act.\n\n3. **No Civil Court Jurisdiction**: No civil court has jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter that an adjudicating officer or the SAT is empowered to determine. This limits the ability of parties to seek redress outside the SAT for matters that fall within its jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Appeal to Supreme Court**: Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the SAT can file an appeal to the Supreme Court, which indicates that the SAT's decisions can be further challenged, but only within the framework established by law.\n\n### Jurisdiction of SAT\n- The SAT exercises the same powers as a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, while trying a suit. This includes the ability to enforce attendance, require the discovery and production of documents, and other powers necessary for the adjudication of appeals.\n- The SAT is also empowered to hear appeals against orders made by other regulatory bodies, such as the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), under certain conditions.\n\nIn summary, the limitations of the Securities Appellate Tribunal primarily revolve around the time frame for filing appeals and the specific jurisdiction granted to it under the SEBI Act and related laws. Its decisions can be further appealed to the Supreme Court, ensuring a layer of judicial oversight.
