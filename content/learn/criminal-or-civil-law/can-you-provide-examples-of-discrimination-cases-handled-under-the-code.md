answer: >-
    The Ontario Human Rights Code (the Code) provides a framework for addressing discrimination and harassment in various contexts, including employment, housing, and services. Here are some notable examples of discrimination cases handled under the Code:\n\n1. **A.B. v. C.D. (2022 HRTO 890)**: In this case, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) found that the applicant experienced discrimination based on sex. The applicant's work environment was deemed poisoned by repeated acts of discrimination and harassment perpetrated by the company's owner, which ultimately led to her resignation. The HRTO ruled that the employer was responsible for the owner's actions as he was a directing mind of the organization.\n\n2. **Zurich Insurance Case**: The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Zurich Insurance did not discriminate against Michael Bates by charging him higher premiums for automobile insurance based on his age, sex, and marital status. This case highlights the complexities involved in proving discrimination under the Code, as the court found that the insurance company's practices were not discriminatory.\n\n3. **Age Discrimination in Employment**: A scenario was presented where a 50-year-old employee was terminated, and a 32-year-old job applicant was turned away due to not fitting the workplace culture. Both individuals could potentially file human rights claims based on age discrimination, which is often linked to ageism in the workplace.\n\n4. **Hucsko v. A.O. Smith Enterprises Limited (2021 ONCA 728)**: This case involved the refusal of an employer to participate in remedial action following a workplace sexual harassment investigation. The tribunal found that such refusal constituted just cause for dismissal, emphasizing the employer's obligation to maintain a discrimination-free workplace for all employees, including those who are gender queer, non-binary, and trans.\n\nThese examples illustrate the various forms of discrimination that can occur and the legal complexities involved in proving such cases under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Each case is unique and often hinges on the specific facts and evidence presented.
