    What is the government's role in the judicial appointment process in India?
answer: >-
    The government's role in the judicial appointment process in India has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting a complex interplay between the executive and the judiciary. The Constitution of India, particularly Articles 124(2) and 217, outlines the framework for judicial appointments, aiming to balance the powers of both branches.\n\nInitially, the appointment of judges was a collaborative process involving both the President (executive) and the judiciary. However, this changed with a series of landmark Supreme Court rulings known as the First, Second, and Third Judges cases. These rulings established the primacy of the judiciary in judicial appointments, leading to the creation of the collegium system, where a group of senior judges is responsible for recommending appointments and transfers of judges in the higher judiciary.\n\nIn 2014, the Indian government attempted to reform this system by introducing the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) through the Ninety-ninth Amendment Act. The NJAC was designed to include members from both the judiciary and the executive, specifically comprising the Chief Justice of India, two senior-most Supreme Court judges, the Union Minister of Law and Justice, and two eminent persons from civil society. However, the Supreme Court declared the NJAC unconstitutional in 2015, asserting that it undermined the independence of the judiciary.\n\nDespite the government's diminished role in the current system, there remains an ongoing debate about the balance of power in judicial appointments. Critics argue that the executive's involvement could lead to a compromise in judicial independence, while some advocate for a more inclusive approach that allows for shared responsibilities between the two branches.\n\nIn summary, while the government has a role in the judicial appointment process, particularly through the constitutional framework, the judiciary currently holds the primary authority in these appointments, reflecting a commitment to maintaining judicial independence in India.
