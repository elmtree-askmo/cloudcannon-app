    How does the principle of 'just deserts' relate to retributive justice?
answer: >-
    The principle of 'just deserts' is fundamentally intertwined with the concept of retributive justice. It posits that offenders should receive punishments that are proportionate to the severity of their crimes, emphasizing fairness and moral accountability. This principle asserts that individuals deserve to be punished in a manner that reflects the moral blameworthiness of their actions, thereby serving as a foundational notion for retributive justice systems.\n\nIn retributive justice, the focus is primarily on the punishment itself rather than on deterrence or rehabilitation. The severity of the punishment is expected to correspond directly to the seriousness of the offense committed. This alignment with the 'just deserts' principle ensures that justice is perceived as being served when the punishment accurately reflects the moral culpability of the offender. \n\nThe 'just deserts' approach was notably endorsed by the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which highlighted seriousness and proportionality as key concepts in sentencing. This framework has been subject to scrutiny and debate, particularly regarding how subsequent legislative changes may have affected its application. Critics argue that while the principle aims to uphold justice, it can sometimes lead to overly harsh penalties that do not consider the broader social and systemic issues at play.\n\nIn summary, 'just deserts' is a critical element of retributive justice, advocating for a punishment system that is fair and proportionate, thereby reinforcing the moral foundations of justice within society.
