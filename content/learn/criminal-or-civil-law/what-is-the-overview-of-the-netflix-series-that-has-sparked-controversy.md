    What is the overview of the Netflix series that has sparked controversy?
answer: >-
    The Netflix series that has sparked significant controversy is "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story." This series has faced backlash primarily for its perceived glamorization of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and its insensitivity towards the families of his victims. Critics argue that the dramatization and fictionalization of Dahmer's real-life crimes re-traumatizes the victims' families and glorifies criminal behavior, which raises ethical concerns about the portrayal of such sensitive subjects.\n\nMany families of Dahmer's victims have expressed outrage, noting that they were not consulted about the series prior to its release. This lack of engagement has contributed to feelings of hurt and anger among those directly affected by Dahmer's actions. Additionally, the way Netflix categorized the show—using labels such as "Horror," "Ominous," "Dark," "Vintage crime," "Psychological," and "LGBTQ"—has also drawn criticism, as it seems to trivialize the serious nature of the events depicted.\n\nDespite the controversy, "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story" has achieved remarkable viewership, recording the highest first-week viewing figures for a new series on Netflix since the platform began tracking ratings in June 2021. This juxtaposition of high viewership against the backdrop of ethical concerns highlights the complex nature of true crime entertainment in contemporary media.
