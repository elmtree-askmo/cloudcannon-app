    What are some landmark cases related to the Free Exercise Clause?
answer: >-
    Several landmark cases have significantly shaped the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from interfering with individuals' rights to practice their religion. Here are some key cases:\n\n1. **Reynolds v. United States (1878)**: This case established the precedent that while the government cannot interfere with religious beliefs, it can regulate religious practices. The Supreme Court ruled that the Free Exercise Clause protects beliefs but not actions, leading to the conclusion that laws can restrict practices that conflict with public policy.\n\n2. **Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940)**: This case was pivotal in incorporating the Free Exercise Clause against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that a state law requiring a permit for religious solicitation violated the Free Exercise rights of the Cantwell family, emphasizing the importance of religious freedom.\n\n3. **Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)**: The Supreme Court ruled that the state could not compel Amish children to attend school past the eighth grade, as it violated their parents' rights to direct their children's religious upbringing. This case highlighted the balance between state interests and individual religious rights.\n\n4. **Employment Division v. Smith (1990)**: In this case, the Court ruled that the Free Exercise Clause does not provide a right to religious exemptions from generally applicable laws. The case involved two Native Americans who were denied unemployment benefits after being fired for using peyote in a religious ceremony. This decision limited the scope of religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n5. **Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah (1993)**: The Supreme Court found that the city’s ordinances prohibiting animal sacrifice were unconstitutional as they targeted the Santería religion specifically. This case reinforced the idea that laws must be neutral and not specifically aimed at religious practices.\n\n6. **Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021)**: This recent case involved a Catholic foster care agency that was barred from placing children with same-sex couples. The Supreme Court ruled that the city’s actions violated the Free Exercise Clause, emphasizing that the government must provide religious exemptions when it burdens religious practices.\n\n7. **Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022)**: This case involved a high school football coach who prayed on the field after games. The Court ruled in favor of the coach, stating that his actions were protected under the Free Exercise Clause, further expanding the interpretation of religious expression in public settings.\n\nThese cases illustrate the evolving interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause and the ongoing balancing act between individual religious rights and government authority.
