    What security measures have been implemented in Manipur following recent violence?
answer: >-
    Following the recent violence in Manipur, particularly after the tragic Jiribam massacre, authorities have implemented several significant security measures to restore order and ensure public safety. Here are the key actions taken:\n\n1. **Establishment of Checkpoints**: The Manipur Police have intensified their security presence by setting up 94 checkpoints across the state. This includes both hill and valley districts, aimed at controlling movement and preventing further violence.\n\n2. **Search Operations**: Alongside the checkpoints, the police are conducting extensive search operations to locate and apprehend individuals involved in the violence, particularly those believed to be affiliated with militant groups.\n\n3. **Internet Suspension**: The government has extended the suspension of mobile internet services to curb the spread of misinformation and prevent the organization of violent protests. This measure is part of a broader strategy to maintain peace in the region.\n\n4. **Deployment of Additional Forces**: In response to the escalating violence, the Indian government has deployed over 10,000 additional soldiers to Manipur. This move is intended to bolster the existing security forces and provide a stronger presence in areas affected by unrest.\n\n5. **Investigation by National Agencies**: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has been tasked with investigating the recent violence, including the Jiribam incident. This indicates a serious approach to addressing the underlying issues and holding perpetrators accountable.\n\n6. **Government Directives**: The Ministry of Home Affairs has directed all security forces in Manipur to take necessary measures to restore order and peace, highlighting the urgency of the situation.\n\nThese measures reflect the government's commitment to addressing the ongoing violence and restoring stability in Manipur, which has been marred by ethnic tensions and conflict between the Kuki and Meitei communities.
