    What led to the resignation of the Delhi Chief Minister?
answer: >-
    Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, resigned from his position on September 17, 2024, shortly after being granted bail in a bribery case related to a controversial liquor policy. His resignation came as a strategic political move, aimed at distancing himself from the corruption allegations that had surrounded him and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Kejriwal had been arrested earlier in March on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor, which he has consistently denied.\n\nThe decision to resign was seen as an effort to reclaim moral credibility and to mitigate the impact of the corruption narrative that had been building against him and his party. Kejriwal expressed that he did not enter politics for personal gain but to change the political landscape of the country. He indicated that he could not continue under the cloud of corruption allegations and wanted to return to the public with a clean slate.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Atishi, a senior AAP leader, was appointed as the new Chief Minister of Delhi. The party indicated that Atishi would serve in this role until the next assembly elections, at which point they anticipated that Kejriwal would be re-elected with a strong mandate from the public. This transition was framed as a way to maintain continuity in governance while addressing the political challenges posed by the ongoing legal issues surrounding Kejriwal.
