    What are the basic rules of the road that drivers must follow in Tennessee?
answer: >-
    In Tennessee, drivers must adhere to several basic rules of the road to ensure safety and compliance with state laws. Here are some key regulations:\n\n1. **Obedience to Traffic Laws**: All drivers are required to obey traffic laws and regulations as outlined in the Tennessee Code Title 55, Chapter 8. This includes following the instructions of police officers directing traffic.\n\n2. **Driving on Roadways Laned for Traffic**: When a roadway is divided into clearly marked lanes, drivers must stay within their designated lane unless it is safe to change lanes (TCA 55-8-123).\n\n3. **Speed Limits**: The maximum speed limit on interstate highways is 70 mph, while other public roads may have a maximum of 65 mph. Local municipalities can set lower speed limits, but they cannot exceed 55 mph (TCA 55-8-152).\n\n4. **Seat Belt Law**: Tennessee is a primary safety belt state, meaning that all drivers and passengers are required to wear seat belts at all times while the vehicle is in operation (TCA 55-9-603).\n\n5. **Texting While Driving**: It is illegal to text while driving in Tennessee, which aims to reduce distractions and enhance road safety (TCA 55-8-199).\n\n6. **Move Over Law**: Drivers must yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles with activated lights by moving into the closest available lane when safe (TCA 55-8-132).\n\n7. **Open Container Law**: Drivers are prohibited from consuming or possessing an open container of alcohol while operating a vehicle (TCA 55-10-416).\n\n8. **Traffic Control Devices**: Drivers must obey all traffic control devices, including stop signs and traffic signals (TCA 55-8-109).\n\n9. **Child Passenger Restraint**: Tennessee law requires the use of child passenger restraint systems for children under a certain age, ensuring their safety while traveling (TCA 55-9-602).\n\nThese rules are designed to promote safe driving practices and reduce the risk of accidents on Tennessee roads. For more detailed information, drivers can refer to the Tennessee Comprehensive Driver License Manual and the Tennessee Department of Safety resources.
