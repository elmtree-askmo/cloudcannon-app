    What is the legal definition of disability under the ADA?
answer: >-
    The legal definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is outlined in 42 U.S. Code ยง 12102. According to the ADA, a person is considered to have a disability if they meet one of the following criteria:\n\n1. **A physical or mental impairment** that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\n2. **A record of such an impairment**, meaning that the individual has a history of a disability that previously limited their major life activities.\n3. **Being regarded as having such an impairment**, which means that an individual is perceived by others as having a disability, regardless of whether they actually have one.\n\nMajor life activities include essential functions such as walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. The ADA emphasizes that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity should be made without considering the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, such as medication or assistive devices, except for ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.\n\nIt is important to note that the ADA's definition of disability is a legal term and differs from definitions used in other laws, such as those related to Social Security Disability benefits. The ADA aims to provide broad protections against discrimination for individuals with disabilities in various areas, including employment, public accommodations, and government services.
