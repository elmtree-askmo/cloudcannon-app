    What criteria must be met for the bona fide insurance plan defense to be valid?
answer: >-
    To establish a valid bona fide insurance plan defense under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an employer must meet two key criteria:\n\n1. **The Benefit Plan is Bona Fide**: The employer must demonstrate that the insurance plan in question is a legitimate, operational plan that provides actual benefits. This means that the plan must exist, pay benefits, and have terms that are clearly defined and adhered to. The plan should not be merely a facade or a pretext for discriminatory practices.\n\n2. **The Plan is Not a Subterfuge to Evade the Purposes of the ADA**: The employer must show that the plan is not designed to circumvent the protections afforded by the ADA. This involves proving that the distinctions made by the plan are justified and not intended to discriminate against individuals with disabilities. The plan should comply with applicable laws and not be structured in a way that specifically targets or disadvantages individuals based on their disabilities.\n\nThese criteria are outlined in 42 U.S.C. Section 12201 and 29 C.F.R. 1630.16(f), which provide guidance on how the bona fide insurance plan defense can be applied in ADA litigation. The intent behind these requirements is to ensure that benefit plans genuinely serve their purpose without undermining the rights of individuals with disabilities.
