    How are absolute and conditional discharges applied in the legal system?
answer: >-
    In the legal system, absolute and conditional discharges are two types of non-custodial sentences that a court can impose, primarily for less serious offenses. \n\n### Absolute Discharge\nAn absolute discharge is the most lenient form of sentencing available. It occurs when a court finds that a crime has technically been committed but determines that imposing any punishment would be inappropriate. As a result, the case is closed without a conviction being recorded against the defendant. This means that the individual will not be on probation or bound by any court orders, and their record will not show a conviction. Absolute discharges are typically reserved for cases where the court believes that the circumstances do not warrant punishment, considering factors such as the nature of the offense and the character of the offender.\n\n### Conditional Discharge\nIn contrast, a conditional discharge allows the offender to avoid a conviction on their record, provided they meet certain conditions set by the court. These conditions are usually outlined in a probation order and can include requirements such as community service, regular meetings with a probation officer, or payment of fines and restitution. The probation period for a conditional discharge can last from six months to three years. If the offender fails to comply with the conditions, the court may impose a sentence, which could include a conviction.\n\n### Application in the Legal System\nBoth types of discharges are applicable under specific circumstances, as outlined in legal statutes such as section 730(1) of the Criminal Code in Canada. They are generally used for offenses that do not carry mandatory minimum sentences or are not punishable by imprisonment for extended periods. For instance, in the year leading up to June 2019, there were significantly more conditional discharges (20,222) compared to absolute discharges (2,106) for non-motoring summary offenses, indicating that conditional discharges are more commonly applied.\n\nIn summary, absolute discharges result in no record of conviction and no conditions, while conditional discharges require compliance with specific conditions for a set period to avoid a conviction. Both serve as alternatives to more severe penalties, reflecting the legal system's approach to minor offenses and the rehabilitation of offenders.
