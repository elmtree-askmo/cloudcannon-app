    How did the police respond to the White Night Riot?
answer: >-
    The police response to the White Night Riot, which occurred on May 21, 1979, was marked by significant tension and violence. The riots erupted following the announcement of a lenient verdict for Dan White, who had assassinated San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. The initial spark for the riot was a confrontation between police and protesters, which escalated when a drag queen threw coffee at an officer.\n\nAs the riots unfolded, police attempted to control the situation, but their efforts were met with resistance from the crowd. The police waded into the fray, and the violence quickly escalated, leading to substantial damage in the Civic Center and Castro districts. Reports indicate that numerous arrests were made during the chaos, and the estimated cost of the damage reached around $1 million.\n\nOne notable aspect of the police response was what became known as "Mullen's Retreat," where officers withdrew from the Castro district, a move that some officers reportedly preferred over further confrontation. This retreat highlighted the chaotic nature of the events and the challenges faced by law enforcement in managing the unrest.\n\nThe aftermath of the riots saw police resting on the steps of City Hall, reflecting the exhaustion and turmoil of the night. The White Night Riot is remembered as one of the most violent protests in San Francisco's history and has since become a significant event in the narrative of LGBTQ+ activism and community resilience in the city.
