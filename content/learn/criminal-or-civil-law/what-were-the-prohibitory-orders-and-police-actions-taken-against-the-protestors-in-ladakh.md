    What were the prohibitory orders and police actions taken against the protestors in Ladakh?
answer: >-
    In response to the protests in Ladakh, several prohibitory orders and police actions were implemented to manage the situation. The Ladakh administration imposed an indefinite prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which restricts gatherings and rallies. This order was justified by authorities citing potential breaches of peace, particularly in light of planned protests demanding statehood for Ladakh and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.\n\nIn addition to the prohibitory orders, the administration also reduced internet speeds in the region, limiting mobile data services to 2G within a 10-kilometer radius of Leh city for 24 hours. This action was taken to hinder the planned 'border march' organized by the Apex Body, which aimed to highlight issues such as shrinking pasturelands.\n\nOn a national level, the Delhi Police detained around 125 protesters, including prominent climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, at the Singhu border as they attempted to march into the capital. This detention occurred under the prohibitory orders that were in effect in Delhi until October 6. The police actions sparked significant backlash, with many protesters in Leh expressing their anger over the detentions and the perceived overreach of the authorities.\n\nOverall, the combination of prohibitory orders, internet restrictions, and police detentions reflects a broader strategy by the authorities to control dissent and manage protests in the region.
