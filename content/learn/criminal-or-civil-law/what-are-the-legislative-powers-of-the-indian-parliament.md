    What are the legislative powers of the Indian Parliament?
answer: >-
    The legislative powers of the Indian Parliament are extensive and are primarily vested in its two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). Here are the key aspects of these powers:\n\n1. **Supreme Legislative Authority**: The Indian Parliament is the supreme legislative body of the Republic of India, and it has the authority to make laws on a wide range of subjects enumerated in the Constitution. This includes laws that are applicable throughout the country.\n\n2. **Bicameral Structure**: The Parliament consists of two houses:\n   - **Lok Sabha**: Members are directly elected by the people and have a tenure of five years. The Lok Sabha has significant powers, especially concerning financial matters, as it is the only house that can introduce money bills.\n   - **Rajya Sabha**: This is a permanent house with members serving staggered six-year terms. While it has fewer powers than the Lok Sabha, it can still participate in the legislative process, including the passage of regular laws (except money bills).\n\n3. **Legislative Procedures**: The legislative process is governed by Articles 79-122 of the Indian Constitution, which outline the organization, composition, and functioning of Parliament. This includes the procedures for introducing bills, debating them, and voting.\n\n4. **Types of Legislation**: The Parliament can enact various types of legislation, including:\n   - **Ordinary Laws**: These require approval from both houses.\n   - **Money Bills**: These can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and must be passed by it before being sent to the Rajya Sabha.\n   - **Constitutional Amendments**: These require a special majority and must be passed by both houses.\n\n5. **Exclusive Powers**: The Lok Sabha has certain exclusive powers, such as:\n   - The power to initiate and pass money bills.\n   - The authority to approve the budget and financial proposals.\n   - The ability to pass a no-confidence motion against the government.\n\n6. **Rajya Sabha's Role**: While the Rajya Sabha has the same authority to pass regular laws, it plays a crucial role in representing the states and Union Territories, thus protecting their interests at the national level.\n\n7. **Amendment Powers**: The Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, which requires a specific procedure and majority, reflecting its role in shaping the constitutional framework of the country.\n\n8. **Judicial Powers**: The Parliament also has the authority to define the jurisdiction of various courts and to legislate on matters related to the judicial system.\n\nIn summary, the Indian Parliament holds comprehensive legislative powers that enable it to enact laws, amend the Constitution, and oversee the financial and judicial frameworks of the country, thereby playing a crucial role in the governance of India.
