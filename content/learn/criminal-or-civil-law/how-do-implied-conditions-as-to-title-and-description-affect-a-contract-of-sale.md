    How do implied conditions as to title and description affect a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    Implied conditions regarding title and description play a crucial role in contracts of sale under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. These conditions are automatically included in the contract, even if they are not explicitly stated, and they serve to protect the interests of both buyers and sellers.\n\n1. **Implied Condition as to Title**: According to Section 14(a) of the Sale of Goods Act, there is an implied condition that the seller has the right to sell the goods. This means that the seller must have ownership or the authority to sell the goods at the time the property is to pass to the buyer. If the seller does not have this right, the buyer may reject the goods and claim damages.\n\n2. **Implied Condition as to Description**: Section 15 of the Act stipulates that when goods are sold by description, there is an implied condition that the goods must correspond with that description. This means that if a buyer purchases goods based on a specific description provided by the seller, the goods delivered must match that description. If they do not, the buyer has the right to reject the goods and seek a remedy.\n\n3. **Impact on Contracts**: The presence of these implied conditions ensures that buyers receive what they expect based on the seller's representations. If either condition is breached, it can lead to significant legal consequences, including the potential for the contract to be voided. For instance, if a buyer receives goods that do not match the description, they can claim a refund or compensation.\n\n4. **Legal Framework**: The implied conditions are part of the legal framework governing commercial transactions, ensuring fairness and accountability in the sale of goods. They help to establish trust between parties and provide a basis for legal recourse in case of disputes.\n\nIn summary, implied conditions as to title and description are fundamental to the integrity of contracts of sale, safeguarding the rights of buyers and ensuring that sellers fulfill their obligations.
