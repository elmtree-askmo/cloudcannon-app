    How is the unified command structure being implemented in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The unified command structure in Manipur was established to enhance coordination among various security forces and agencies in response to the ongoing ethnic violence and instability in the state. On May 30, 2023, Kuldiep Singh, the security adviser to the Manipur government, was appointed as the chairperson of this unified command. This structure aims to integrate efforts from multiple central agencies, security forces, and local administration to maintain law and order.\n\nThe unified command includes personnel from the Indian Army, Assam Rifles, Border Security Force, and Central Reserve Police Force, all of which are stationed in Manipur. The initiative was announced by Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his visit to the state, emphasizing the need for an unbiased approach to restore stability.\n\nDespite the establishment of this command, there are concerns regarding its efficacy. Critics argue that the command has shown reactive responses to violent conflicts, as evidenced by the spread of ethnic violence to areas like Jiribam District, despite prior warnings. Additionally, some local organizations, such as the Kuki Inpi Manipur, have expressed skepticism about the command's intentions, suggesting that it may serve to consolidate political power rather than effectively restore order.\n\nOverall, the unified command structure is a significant step taken by the government to address the complex security challenges in Manipur, but its effectiveness remains under scrutiny amid ongoing tensions.
