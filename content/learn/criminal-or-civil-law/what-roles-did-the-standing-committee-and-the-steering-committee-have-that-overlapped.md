    What roles did the Standing Committee and the Steering Committee have that overlapped?
answer: >-
    The Standing Committee and the Steering Committee in the context of governance and project management have distinct roles, but there are areas where their functions may overlap.\n\n1. **Purpose and Scope**:\n   - **Standing Committees** are permanent committees established by the Parliament to address specific areas of public policy or administration. They operate continuously and are involved in legislative oversight, budget review, and policy formulation.\n   - **Steering Committees**, on the other hand, are typically formed for specific projects or initiatives. They provide strategic direction, align projects with broader organizational goals, and ensure that projects are executed effectively.\n\n2. **Composition**:\n   - Standing Committees consist of Members of Parliament (MPs) and are structured to represent various political parties and interests within the legislative framework.\n   - Steering Committees are composed of experts, senior stakeholders, and authoritative figures relevant to the specific project or initiative they oversee.\n\n3. **Functions**:\n   - Both committees may engage in advocacy for their respective areas. Standing Committees advocate for legislative changes or budget allocations, while Steering Committees advocate for project initiatives and resource allocation.\n   - Both types of committees are involved in setting strategies and goals. Standing Committees may set legislative priorities, while Steering Committees establish project objectives and milestones.\n\n4. **Decision-Making**:\n   - Standing Committees play a crucial role in the legislative process, making recommendations that can influence laws and policies.\n   - Steering Committees make decisions regarding project direction, budget approvals, and resource allocation, which can impact the success of specific initiatives.\n\nIn summary, while Standing Committees focus on legislative oversight and public policy, and Steering Committees concentrate on project management and strategic direction, they both share responsibilities in advocacy, strategy setting, and decision-making, which can lead to overlapping functions in certain contexts.
