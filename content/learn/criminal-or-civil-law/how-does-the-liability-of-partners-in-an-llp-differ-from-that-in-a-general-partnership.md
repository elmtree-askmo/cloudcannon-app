    How does the liability of partners in an LLP differ from that in a general partnership?
answer: >-
    The liability of partners in a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) significantly differs from that in a general partnership. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Personal Liability**:\n   - **General Partnership**: In a general partnership, all partners are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. This means that if the partnership incurs debt or is sued, the personal assets of all partners can be at risk to satisfy those obligations.\n   - **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**: In contrast, partners in an LLP enjoy limited liability protection. They are not personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the LLP beyond their capital contributions. This means that their personal assets are generally protected from claims against the partnership, except in cases where a partner is personally at fault for wrongful acts.\n\n2. **Liability for Other Partners' Actions**:\n   - **General Partnership**: Each partner can be held liable for the actions of other partners. For example, if one partner commits a wrongful act in the course of business, all partners can be held liable for that act.\n   - **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**: Partners in an LLP are not personally liable for the negligence or misconduct of other partners. This is a significant advantage of the LLP structure, as it protects partners from being held accountable for the actions of their co-partners, provided those actions occur within the ordinary course of business.\n\n3. **Legal Framework**:\n   - The liability protections in an LLP are often codified in state laws, such as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), which outlines the limited liability provisions for partners in an LLP. For instance, RUPA Section 305A specifies that partners in an LLP are generally not personally liable for the wrongful acts or omissions of other partners or employees of the partnership, as long as these acts occur within the scope of the partnership's business.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference lies in the level of personal liability: partners in a general partnership face unlimited personal liability, while partners in an LLP benefit from limited liability, protecting their personal assets from the partnership's debts and the wrongful acts of other partners. This makes LLPs a more attractive option for many professionals, particularly in fields such as law and accounting, where the risk of liability can be significant.
