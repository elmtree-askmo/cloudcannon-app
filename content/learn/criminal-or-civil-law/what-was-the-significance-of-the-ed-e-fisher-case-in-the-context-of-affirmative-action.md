    What was the significance of the Ed E. Fisher case in the context of affirmative action?
answer: >-
    The significance of the Fisher v. University of Texas case, particularly in its two iterations (Fisher I in 2013 and Fisher II in 2016), lies in its profound impact on affirmative action policies in higher education and the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn Fisher I, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated a Fifth Circuit ruling that had upheld the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action admissions policy. The Court remanded the case, emphasizing that the lower court had not applied the strict scrutiny standard required for evaluating race-conscious admissions policies. This decision underscored the necessity for universities to demonstrate that their affirmative action programs are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity, thereby setting a higher bar for such policies.\n\nFisher II, decided in 2016, further affirmed the university's admissions policy, with the Supreme Court ruling 4-3 in favor of the university. This ruling validated the use of limited affirmative action in admissions, allowing institutions to consider race as one factor among many in a holistic review process. The decision was significant as it reaffirmed the legality of affirmative action in higher education, while also highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding the use of race in admissions and the broader implications for equal protection under the law.\n\nOverall, the Fisher cases are pivotal in shaping the legal landscape of affirmative action, influencing how universities construct their admissions policies and reinforcing the contentious nature of race-conscious policies in the United States. The rulings have implications not only for higher education but also for the interpretation of civil rights laws and the ongoing discourse on equality and diversity in various sectors.
