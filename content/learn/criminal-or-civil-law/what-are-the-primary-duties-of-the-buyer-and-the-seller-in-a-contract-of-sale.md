This includes ensuring that the goods are delivered at the agreed time and place.\n2. **Conformity to Contract**: The goods delivered must conform to the specifications outlined in the contract, including quality, quantity, and description.\n3. **Documentation**: The seller must provide any necessary documentation that accompanies the goods, such as invoices or certificates of authenticity.\n4. **Right to Payment**: The seller has the right to receive payment for the goods delivered, as stipulated in the contract.\n\n### Duties of the Buyer:\n1. **Payment for Goods**: The primary duty of the buyer is to pay the agreed price for the goods delivered. This payment must be made at the time and place specified in the contract.\n2. **Acceptance of Delivery**: The buyer must accept the delivery of goods when the seller is ready to deliver them, provided that the goods conform to the contract.\n3. **Examination of Goods**: The buyer has the right to examine the goods upon delivery to ensure they meet the contractual specifications.
