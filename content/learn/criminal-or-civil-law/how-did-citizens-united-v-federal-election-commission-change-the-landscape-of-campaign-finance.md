    How did Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission change the landscape of campaign finance?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* (2010) significantly transformed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. This landmark ruling arose from a dispute over a politically charged film critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign. The Court ultimately ruled that the government could not restrict independent expenditures for political communications by corporations and unions, equating such spending with free speech protected under the First Amendment.\n\nKey changes resulting from the *Citizens United* decision include:\n\n1. **Lifting Restrictions on Corporate and Union Spending**: The ruling struck down previous prohibitions on corporate and union independent expenditures, allowing these entities to spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates. This fundamentally altered the dynamics of campaign financing, enabling a surge in spending from corporate and union sources.\n\n2. **Creation of Super PACs**: Following the decision, the emergence of Super Political Action Committees (Super PACs) became a notable consequence. These organizations can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations, and unions, provided that their spending is independent of any candidate's campaign. This has led to a significant increase in the influence of wealthy donors in political campaigns.\n\n3. **Rise of Dark Money**: The ruling also facilitated the growth of "dark money" in politics, where nonprofit organizations can engage in political spending without disclosing their donors. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in undisclosed contributions, with dark money spending rising from $129 million in the decade prior to the ruling to approximately $963 million in the following decade.\n\n4. **Impact on Political Equality**: Critics argue that *Citizens United* has exacerbated wealth inequality in political influence, reinforcing the notion that the democratic process primarily serves the interests of the wealthy few. Polls indicate that a significant majority of Americans believe that wealthy political donors contribute to political dysfunction and that reducing their influence is crucial for a healthy democracy.\n\n5. **Legislative Responses and Reforms**: In response to the ruling, various state-level initiatives have emerged to counteract the effects of unlimited political spending. Advocates for campaign finance reform continue to push for stronger disclosure requirements and other measures to enhance transparency in political donations.\n\nOverall, *Citizens United v. FEC* has had profound implications for campaign finance, reshaping the political landscape by enabling greater financial influence from corporations and wealthy individuals, while raising concerns about the integrity and equality of the democratic process.
