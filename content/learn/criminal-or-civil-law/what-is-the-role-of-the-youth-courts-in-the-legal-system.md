    What is the role of the Youth Courts in the legal system?
answer: >-
    The Youth Courts play a crucial role in the legal system, particularly within the context of the Family Justice Courts. Their primary function is to handle criminal cases involving children and young persons, specifically those under the age of 16. Here are the key aspects of their role:\n\n1. **Focus on Rehabilitation**: The Youth Courts emphasize rehabilitation over punishment. The aim is to reform young offenders rather than impose harsh penalties. This approach recognizes the developmental differences between young individuals and adults, and the belief that young offenders can change their behavior with appropriate support and guidance.\n\n2. **Jurisdiction**: Youth Courts have original jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters involving children (under 14 years old) and young persons (ages 14 to below 16 years old). This means they are the first court to hear these cases, and they can impose sentences that take into account the age and circumstances of the offender.\n\n3. **Types of Cases**: The Youth Courts deal with a variety of cases, including criminal offenses committed by minors. However, in certain serious cases, such as murder, the law allows for these cases to be tried in regular courts, such as the High Court.\n\n4. **Alternative Justice Processes**: Judges and prosecutors in Youth Courts often consider alternative justice processes or non-carceral sentences. This is particularly important in youth cases, where the intentions behind actions can vary significantly, and where young individuals may not fully understand the legal implications of their actions.\n\n5. **Additional Matters**: Beyond criminal cases, Youth Courts may also address issues related to children beyond parental control and child protection cases, ensuring a holistic approach to the welfare of young individuals.\n\nIn summary, the Youth Courts are designed to provide a supportive and rehabilitative environment for young offenders, focusing on their potential for reform while ensuring that justice is served in a manner appropriate to their age and circumstances.
