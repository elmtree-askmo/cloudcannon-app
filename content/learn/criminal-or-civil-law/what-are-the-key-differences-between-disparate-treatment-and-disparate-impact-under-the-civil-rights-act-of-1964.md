    What are the key differences between disparate treatment and disparate impact under the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
answer: >-
    The key differences between disparate treatment and disparate impact under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 primarily revolve around the intent and effects of discriminatory practices.\n\n1. **Disparate Treatment**: This form of discrimination occurs when an individual is treated less favorably than others because of a protected characteristic, such as race, gender, or religion. Disparate treatment involves intentional discrimination, meaning that the employer's actions are motivated by a discriminatory intent. For example, if an employer refuses to hire a qualified candidate solely because of their race, this would constitute disparate treatment.\n\n2. **Disparate Impact**: In contrast, disparate impact refers to policies or practices that, while seemingly neutral on the surface, disproportionately affect a particular group of individuals based on their protected characteristics. This type of discrimination does not require proof of intent; rather, it focuses on the consequences of the employer's policies. For instance, if a company implements a hiring test that is not directly related to job performance and results in significantly lower pass rates for a specific racial group, this could be considered disparate impact.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction lies in the intent behind the discriminatory action: disparate treatment is about intentional discrimination, while disparate impact concerns the unintentional consequences of neutral policies that adversely affect protected groups.
