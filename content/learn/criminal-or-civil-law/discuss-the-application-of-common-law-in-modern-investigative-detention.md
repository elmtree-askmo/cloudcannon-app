    Discuss the application of common law in modern investigative detention.
answer: >-
    The application of common law in modern investigative detention is a nuanced area of law that balances individual rights against the needs of law enforcement. The common law power of investigative detention was notably recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in the landmark case *R v Mann* (2004 SCC 52). This case established that police officers have the authority to detain individuals for investigative purposes when they have reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity.\n\n### Key Aspects of Investigative Detention\n\n1. **Reasonable Suspicion**: The foundation of investigative detention is the concept of reasonable suspicion. Police must have specific and articulable facts that lead them to believe that a person is involved in criminal activity. This standard is less stringent than the probable cause required for an arrest but must be based on more than a mere hunch.\n\n2. **Duration and Scope**: Investigative detentions are intended to be brief and limited in scope. The police may ask questions and conduct a limited search for weapons if they have concerns for their safety. However, the detention should not last longer than necessary to confirm or dispel the suspicion.\n\n3. **Rights of the Detainee**: Under Section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained. Section 10(a) further stipulates that individuals must be informed promptly of the reasons for their detention. If the detention is found to be unreasonable, any evidence obtained may be excluded under the Charter remedies.\n\n4. **Common Law Development**: The common law power of investigative detention has evolved incrementally. It is rooted in the need for police to address time-sensitive issues and gather information that may prevent crime or apprehend suspects. The courts have emphasized that this power must be exercised in a manner that respects individual rights and is consistent with the principles of justice.\n\n5. **Confusion with Other Powers**: There can be confusion between investigative detention and other police powers, such as search incident to arrest. The distinction is important because the legal standards and implications for the rights of individuals differ significantly. Courts have noted the need for clarity in how these powers are applied to avoid infringing on privacy rights.\n\n6. **Exigent Circumstances**: In some cases, exigent circumstances may justify a detention without a warrant. This means that if there is an immediate need to act to prevent harm or the destruction of evidence, police may detain individuals without prior authorization.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the application of common law in modern investigative detention is characterized by a careful balance between law enforcement's need to investigate and the protection of individual rights. The principles established in *R v Mann* continue to guide how police conduct investigative detentions, ensuring that they are based on reasonable suspicion and are executed in a manner that respects the legal rights of individuals. As this area of law continues to evolve, ongoing judicial scrutiny will be essential to maintain this balance.
