    What defines an 'Impact Pattern' in bloodstain analysis?
answer: >-
    An 'Impact Pattern' in bloodstain analysis is defined as a bloodstain pattern that results from an object striking liquid blood. This definition is supported by guidelines from the Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) and is further elaborated in forensic literature, such as "Bloodstain Pattern Analysis, Third Edition." \n\nCharacteristics of an impact pattern include the shape of the stains, where the minor axis of the stain is narrower than the major axis. This distinctive shape can help forensic analysts determine the nature of the impact and the circumstances surrounding the bloodshed.\n\nImpact patterns are crucial in bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA), which is a forensic discipline that examines the physical aspects of bloodstains to reconstruct the events of a crime. Understanding the characteristics of impact patterns allows investigators to draw conclusions about the actions that led to the bloodshed, thereby providing valuable insights into the sequence of events during violent crimes.
