    What are the specific rules for left and right turns?
answer: >-
    When making left and right turns, there are specific rules and guidelines that drivers should follow to ensure safety and compliance with traffic laws. Hereâ€™s an overview of the rules for both types of turns:\n\n### Left Turn Rules\n1. **Positioning**: When making a left turn from a two-way street, start the turn in the left lane closest to the middle of the street. If there is a center left turn lane available, use it. You may also turn from other lanes if permitted by signs or arrows.\n2. **Yielding**: The driver intending to turn left must yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction that is within the intersection or close enough to pose an immediate hazard.\n3. **Signal**: Always signal your intent to turn left well in advance (at least 30 meters before the intersection).\n4. **Clearance**: Ensure that oncoming lanes are clear before making the turn. As a general rule, do not turn if oncoming vehicles are less than 200 feet (60 meters) away.\n5. **Completion**: Complete the turn into either the left or right-hand lane of the cross street, depending on the lane markings.\n\n### Right Turn Rules\n1. **Positioning**: Begin the right turn in the lane nearest to the right-hand curb and end the turn in the lane nearest the right-hand curb. Approach the intersection in the right-hand lane, staying as close to the curb as possible.\n2. **Signal**: Give the proper turn signal at least 100 feet before making the turn.\n3. **Yielding**: Yield to pedestrians who may be crossing your path and check for any cyclists in your vicinity.\n4. **Avoiding Wide Turns**: Avoid making wide, sweeping turns into other lanes; instead, keep the turn tight to the curb.\n5. **Speed**: Reduce your speed to about 10 to 15 miles per hour as you approach the turn.\n\n### General Considerations\n- **Intersection Navigation**: Ensure that you are in the correct lane for the turn and that you are aware of any traffic signals or signs that may affect your turn.\n- **Safety**: Always prioritize safety by scanning for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles before executing the turn.\n\nBy adhering to these rules, drivers can navigate intersections safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of accidents.
