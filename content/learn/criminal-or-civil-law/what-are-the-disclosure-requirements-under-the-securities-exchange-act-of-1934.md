    What are the disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934?
answer: >-
    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 establishes several key disclosure requirements for companies with publicly traded securities. Here are the main points regarding these requirements:\n\n1. **Registration of Securities**: Under Sections 12(a) and 12(b) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 78l(a)-(b)), all securities traded on exchanges must be registered. This registration process requires issuers to disclose comprehensive information about themselves.\n\n2. **Periodic Reporting**: Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 78m) mandates that "reporting companies" (those with registered publicly held securities or certain sizes) must file periodic reports. This includes:\n   - **Annual Reports**: Companies must file Form 10-K, which provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance.\n   - **Quarterly Reports**: Companies must file Form 10-Q, which includes unaudited financial statements and provides updates on the company's financial condition.\n\n3. **Disclosure Controls and Procedures**: New rules (13a-15 and 15d-15) require issuers to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure accurate reporting.\n\n4. **Insider Reporting**: Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders (those holding more than 10% of a company's stock) to report their transactions and holdings of company securities through Forms 3, 4, and 5.\n\n5. **Ongoing Disclosure for Foreign Private Issuers**: The Act also includes ongoing disclosure requirements for foreign private issuers to keep investors informed about material changes in their financial condition or operations.\n\n6. **Prohibition of Fraudulent Activities**: The Act prohibits insider trading and other fraudulent activities, ensuring that all material information is disclosed to investors.\n\nThese requirements are designed to promote transparency and protect investors by ensuring they have access to essential information about the companies in which they invest.
