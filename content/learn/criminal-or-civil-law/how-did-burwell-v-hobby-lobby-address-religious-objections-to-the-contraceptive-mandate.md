    How did Burwell v. Hobby Lobby address religious objections to the contraceptive mandate?
answer: >-
    In the landmark case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., decided in 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of religious objections to the contraceptive mandate under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that closely held for-profit corporations could refuse to provide contraception coverage in their employee health plans if they had sincere religious objections to doing so.\n\nThe Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., emphasized that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) protects the rights of closely held corporations to exercise their religious beliefs. The Court found that the contraceptive mandate imposed a substantial burden on the exercise of religion for these corporations, as it forced them to choose between compromising their religious beliefs and facing significant financial penalties. Specifically, the ruling noted that Hobby Lobby would incur heavy fees—up to $475 million annually—if it refused to comply with the mandate.\n\nThe Court also determined that the government had not demonstrated that the contraceptive mandate was the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. The majority opinion suggested that the government could explore alternative solutions, such as covering the costs of contraception directly, rather than imposing the mandate on religiously objecting employers.\n\nImportantly, the ruling was limited in scope, applying specifically to closely held corporations with religious objections and not extending to all employers or insurance plans. The decision raised significant implications for reproductive rights and the intersection of religious freedom and healthcare access, leading to ongoing debates about the balance between these rights in the legal landscape.\n\nOverall, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby established a precedent that allowed certain for-profit corporations to assert religious objections to federal mandates, thereby influencing the broader discussion on reproductive rights and employer-provided healthcare.
