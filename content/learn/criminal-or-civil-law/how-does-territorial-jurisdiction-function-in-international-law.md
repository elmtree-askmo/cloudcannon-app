    How does territorial jurisdiction function in international law?
answer: >-
    Territorial jurisdiction in international law is primarily governed by the territoriality principle, which allows a sovereign state to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over individuals and events occurring within its own territory. This principle is fundamental to the concept of state sovereignty and is recognized as the most basic form of jurisdiction in public international law.\n\nUnder the territoriality principle, a state has the right to legislate, enforce laws, and adjudicate matters involving criminal offenses that occur within its borders. This includes the authority to prosecute individuals for crimes committed on its territory and to arrest and apprehend those individuals. The principle underscores the idea that states have control over their own geographical areas and the activities that take place within them.\n\nHowever, the territorial basis of jurisdiction does not extend indefinitely beyond national borders. States must be mindful of their jurisdictional limits, especially when dealing with international crimes such as terrorism or human trafficking, which may involve actions that cross multiple jurisdictions. In such cases, the nationality or active personality principle may come into play, allowing states to exercise jurisdiction over their nationals regardless of where the crime occurred.\n\nIn summary, territorial jurisdiction functions as a key aspect of international law, enabling states to maintain sovereignty and control over their territories while also navigating the complexities of cross-border legal issues.
