    What legal barriers were used to disenfranchise African Americans in the post-Reconstruction South?
answer: >-
    In the post-Reconstruction South, several legal barriers were implemented to disenfranchise African Americans, primarily through the establishment of Jim Crow laws and various discriminatory practices. Here are the key legal mechanisms used:\n\n1. **Jim Crow Laws**: These laws enforced racial segregation in all public facilities, including schools, transportation, and restrooms. They were designed to maintain white supremacy and limit the rights of African Americans, including their voting rights.\n\n2. **Literacy Tests**: Many Southern states instituted literacy tests as a prerequisite for voting. These tests were often complex and confusing, disproportionately affecting African Americans, who had less access to quality education. The tests were used subjectively, allowing white registrars to pass or fail applicants at their discretion.\n\n3. **Poll Taxes**: This was a fee that individuals had to pay in order to vote. Poll taxes effectively disenfranchised many poor African Americans and poor whites who could not afford to pay the tax. This practice was widespread until it was declared unconstitutional in federal elections by the 24th Amendment in 1964.\n\n4. **Grandfather Clause**: Some states enacted laws that allowed individuals to bypass literacy tests and poll taxes if their grandfathers had been eligible to vote before the Civil War. This clause effectively exempted many white voters from disenfranchisement while still disenfranchising African Americans, whose ancestors had been enslaved.\n\n5. **Voter Intimidation and Violence**: Legal barriers were often supplemented by extralegal means, including intimidation, threats, and violence against African Americans who attempted to register to vote or participate in elections. Organizations like the Ku Klux Klan used terror tactics to suppress African American political participation.\n\n6. **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**: This landmark Supreme Court case upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the "separate but equal" doctrine. It provided a legal foundation for the continued disenfranchisement and segregation of African Americans, legitimizing the discriminatory laws that followed.\n\nThese legal barriers were part of a broader system of racial oppression that sought to maintain white dominance in the political, social, and economic spheres of the South, leading to widespread disenfranchisement and systemic inequality for African Americans.
