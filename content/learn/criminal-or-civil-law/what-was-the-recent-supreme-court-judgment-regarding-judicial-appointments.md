    What was the recent Supreme Court judgment regarding judicial appointments?
answer: >-
    The recent Supreme Court judgment regarding judicial appointments highlighted concerns over the central government's "pick and choose" approach when accepting names from the Collegium's proposals for the appointment of judges. The Supreme Court criticized this approach, stating that it disrupts the seniority among those recommended for judgeships. This ruling emphasizes the importance of maintaining a fair and transparent process in judicial appointments, as the integrity of the judiciary is crucial for upholding the rule of law.\n\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court's decisions on judicial appointments are significant because they can set enduring precedents that affect the functioning of the judiciary and the balance of power within the government. The collegium system, which consists of the Chief Justice of India and the four senior-most judges, is responsible for recommending appointments, elevations, and transfers of judges. The recent judgment serves as a reminder of the need for adherence to established protocols in the appointment process to ensure judicial independence and integrity.
