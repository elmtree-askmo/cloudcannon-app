    What were the key steps taken during the initial investigation of the Pickton case?
answer: >-
    The initial investigation of the Robert William Pickton case was marked by several key steps and significant challenges that ultimately hindered the effectiveness of law enforcement's response. Here are the main points regarding the investigation:\n\n1. **Delayed Response**: The investigation began in the late 1990s, but police were slow to respond to the growing number of missing women reports, particularly those involving marginalized individuals from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Despite community demands for a thorough investigation, law enforcement was reluctant to acknowledge the possibility of a serial killer at work.\n\n2. **Systemic Bias**: A public inquiry later revealed that systemic biases against vulnerable populations, including Indigenous women, contributed to the police's lack of urgency. The police treated missing persons cases involving these communities as lower priority, which significantly affected the investigation's progress.\n\n3. **Initial Investigative Actions**: In April 2000, as the number of missing women continued to rise, police began to take more formal steps, but these were often characterized by miscommunication and a lack of coordination among various law enforcement agencies. The investigation was fragmented, and there were missed opportunities to connect the dots between the missing persons reports and Pickton.\n\n4. **Evidence Gathering**: The investigation eventually led to the collection of substantial evidence against Pickton, but this process was fraught with challenges. The police faced criticism for their handling of evidence and the overall investigation strategy, which was deemed ineffective.\n\n5. **Public Inquiry Findings**: A public inquiry conducted in 2012 highlighted the "blatant" police failures and recommended significant reforms in how missing persons cases are handled, particularly those involving marginalized communities. The inquiry underscored the need for a more integrated approach to policing in Greater Vancouver.\n\n6. **Cost of Investigation**: The investigation and subsequent trial were costly, with estimates suggesting that the total expenditure reached approximately $116 million. This financial burden reflects the extensive resources required to address the complexities of the case.\n\nOverall, the initial investigation of the Pickton case serves as a critical example of the systemic failures in law enforcement's approach to missing persons, particularly those from vulnerable communities. The lessons learned from this case have prompted calls for reform in police procedures and greater sensitivity towards marginalized populations.
