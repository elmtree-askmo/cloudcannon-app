    Under the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) in the Philippines, several prohibited acts related to unauthorized processing and access to personal information are outlined. These acts are designed to protect individuals' privacy and ensure the proper handling of personal data. The following are the key prohibited acts:\n\n1. **Unauthorized Processing**: This includes processing personal information without the consent of the data subject or without being authorized under the Data Privacy Act or any existing law. The penalty for unauthorized processing of personal information can range from one to three years of imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000 to PHP 2,000,000.\n\n2. **Accessing Personal Information Due to Negligence**: If an individual, due to negligence, provides access to personal information without proper authorization, this act is also prohibited.\n\n3. **Improper Disposal of Personal Information**: Knowingly or negligently disposing of personal information in a manner that makes it accessible to the public is prohibited.\n\n4. **Processing for Unauthorized Purposes**: Processing personal information for purposes not authorized by the data subject or under the law is prohibited.\n\n5. **Unauthorized Access or Intentional Breach**: This involves knowingly and unlawfully breaking into any system where personal and sensitive personal information is stored.\n\n6. **Concealment of Security Breaches**: If an individual is aware of a security breach involving sensitive personal information and fails to notify the appropriate authorities, this act is prohibited.\n\n7. **Malicious Disclosure**: Disclosing unwarranted or false information regarding personal information with malice or in bad faith is prohibited.\n\n8. **Unauthorized Disclosure**: Disclosing personal information to a third party without the consent of the data subject is also prohibited.\n\nThese prohibitions are part of a broader framework aimed at safeguarding personal data and ensuring that individuals have control over their information. Violations of these provisions can lead to significant penalties, reflecting the importance of data privacy in the Philippines.
