    How does judicial deference impact the application of laws in Florida?
answer: >-
    Judicial deference in Florida has undergone significant changes, particularly with the rejection of the agency deference doctrine, which previously allowed courts to yield to an agency's interpretation of statutes and rules it administered. This shift is largely attributed to the 2018 amendment to the Florida Constitution, specifically Article V, which limits the extent to which courts can defer to state agencies.\n\nHistorically, the agency deference doctrine, rooted in the federal Chevron deference model, permitted courts to respect an agency's interpretation of its governing statutes, provided the agency acted within its authority. However, Florida courts have increasingly moved away from this practice, emphasizing a more stringent review of agency interpretations. This change reflects a desire to maintain tighter control over rulemaking and to ensure that judicial interpretations align closely with the plain meaning of statutes.\n\nThe implications of this shift are multifaceted. On one hand, it enhances judicial oversight and accountability, ensuring that agencies do not overstep their bounds or misinterpret legislative intent. On the other hand, it raises concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for judicial overreach into areas traditionally governed by administrative expertise.\n\nIn practice, Florida courts now focus on whether an agency's interpretation is within the scope of its authority, and they are less likely to defer to agency expertise. This has led to a more rigorous examination of agency actions, which can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative governance.\n\nOverall, the decline of judicial deference in Florida signifies a pivotal change in the relationship between the judiciary and administrative agencies, emphasizing a more active role for the courts in interpreting laws and regulations.
