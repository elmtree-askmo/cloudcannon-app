    What methods are used for roadside testing in DUI cases?
answer: >-
    In DUI (Driving Under the Influence) cases, several methods are employed for roadside testing to assess a driver's level of impairment. The primary methods include:\n\n1. **Field Sobriety Tests (FSTs)**: These tests are commonly used by law enforcement officers when they suspect a driver is impaired. FSTs are designed to measure a driver's physical and cognitive abilities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has approved three standardized field sobriety tests:\n   - **One-Leg Stand**: The driver is asked to stand on one leg for a specified period while counting.\n   - **Walk and Turn**: The driver must walk a straight line heel-to-toe and then turn around and walk back.\n   - **Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus**: The officer observes the driver's eyes as they follow a moving object to check for involuntary eye movements that indicate impairment.\n\n2. **Breath Tests**: Officers may use portable breathalyzers at the roadside to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC). If the initial breath test indicates a BAC above the legal limit, the driver may be arrested for DUI.\n\n3. **Oral Fluid Testing**: This method involves collecting saliva samples to screen for recent drug use. Oral fluid tests are less invasive and can provide rapid results, making them suitable for roadside testing. They are particularly useful for detecting drugs used within the last 24 hours.\n\n4. **Divided Attention Tests**: These tests assess a driver's ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which is often impaired by alcohol or drugs. Examples include asking the driver to count backward or follow specific instructions while performing physical tasks.\n\nThese roadside testing methods are crucial for establishing probable cause for arrest and ensuring that impaired drivers are identified and removed from the road. If a driver refuses to participate in these tests, it may lead to further legal consequences, depending on the jurisdiction.
