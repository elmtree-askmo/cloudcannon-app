    What is the difference between an expressed and an implied condition in a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of a contract of sale, the distinction between expressed and implied conditions is significant and can impact the rights and obligations of the parties involved.\n\n1. **Express Conditions**: These are conditions that are explicitly stated and agreed upon by the parties involved in the contract, either in writing or verbally. For example, if a buyer and seller agree that a product must meet certain specifications or be delivered by a specific date, these stipulations are considered express conditions. The clarity of express conditions leaves little room for ambiguity, and they must be strictly complied with as per the terms of the contract.\n\n2. **Implied Conditions**: In contrast, implied conditions are those that are not explicitly stated in the contract but are presumed to exist by law. These conditions arise from the nature of the transaction or the relationship between the parties. For instance, under the Sale of Goods Act, certain conditions are implied by law, such as the seller's right to sell the goods and that the goods are of satisfactory quality. These implied conditions are automatically included in the contract unless explicitly excluded by the parties.\n\nThe key difference lies in their formulation: express conditions are clearly articulated by the parties, while implied conditions are inferred from the circumstances or legal standards applicable to the sale. This distinction is crucial because the rule of strict compliance applies primarily to express conditions, meaning that failure to meet these conditions can lead to a breach of contract, whereas implied conditions may offer more flexibility in interpretation and enforcement. \n\nUnderstanding these differences helps parties navigate their rights and responsibilities effectively within commercial transactions.
