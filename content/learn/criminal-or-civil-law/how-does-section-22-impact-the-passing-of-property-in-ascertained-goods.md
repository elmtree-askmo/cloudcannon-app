answer: >-
    Section 22 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, plays a crucial role in the passing of property in ascertained goods. According to this section, when there is a contract for the sale of specific goods that are in a deliverable state, but the seller is required to perform some act—such as weighing, measuring, or testing the goods—to ascertain the price, the property does not pass to the buyer until that act is completed.\n\nThis means that even if a contract for the sale of specific goods is made, the ownership of those goods remains with the seller until the necessary actions to determine the price are fulfilled. The buyer must also be notified once these actions are completed for the property to pass. This provision ensures that the seller retains ownership and control over the goods until they are fully prepared for delivery and the price is ascertained, thereby protecting the seller's interests in the transaction.\n\nIn summary, Section 22 emphasizes that the passing of property in ascertained goods is contingent upon the seller completing specific actions necessary to finalize the sale, thereby establishing a clear framework for the transfer of ownership in commercial transactions.
