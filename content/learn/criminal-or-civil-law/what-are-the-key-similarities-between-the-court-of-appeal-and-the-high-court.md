    What are the key similarities between the Court of Appeal and the High Court?
answer: >-
    The Court of Appeal and the High Court share several key similarities, particularly in their roles within the judicial system. Here are the main points of comparison:\n\n1. **Judicial Authority**: Both the Court of Appeal and the High Court are integral parts of the judicial system, with the authority to interpret and apply the law. They both play significant roles in ensuring justice and upholding legal standards.\n\n2. **Review of Legal Decisions**: The High Court is primarily a trial court where cases are initially heard and decided. In contrast, the Court of Appeal serves as an appellate court that reviews decisions made by the High Court. This means that both courts are involved in the legal decision-making process, albeit at different stages.\n\n3. **Panel of Judges**: Both courts typically operate with panels of judges. For instance, the Court of Appeal usually sits in panels of three judges to hear cases, similar to how cases in the High Court may also be heard by multiple judges, especially in significant or complex matters.\n\n4. **Focus on Legal Questions**: Both courts primarily deal with questions of law rather than questions of fact. This means that their decisions are based on legal principles and precedents rather than re-evaluating the factual evidence presented in the original trial.\n\n5. **Impact on Legal Precedents**: Decisions made by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal can set important legal precedents that influence future cases. Their rulings contribute to the development of the law and can have far-reaching implications.\n\n6. **Judicial Review**: Both courts have the power to review and potentially overturn decisions made by lower courts, ensuring that legal standards are maintained and that justice is served.\n\nIn summary, while the High Court and the Court of Appeal serve different functions within the legal system, they share similarities in their judicial authority, focus on legal questions, and roles in shaping legal precedents.
