    How does the Committee of the Whole House differ from a Select Committee?
answer: >-
    The Committee of the Whole House and Select Committees serve distinct functions within the legislative process, particularly in the context of the U.S. Congress.\n\n### Committee of the Whole House\n1. **Composition**: The Committee of the Whole House consists of all members of the House of Representatives. When the House sits as a Committee of the Whole, it allows all representatives to participate in the debate and amendment of legislation.\n2. **Purpose**: This committee is primarily used to facilitate the consideration of bills and resolutions. It allows for a more relaxed set of rules compared to the full House, enabling faster debate and decision-making. For instance, it requires a smaller quorum of 100 members instead of the 218 needed for a full House vote.\n3. **Functionality**: The Committee of the Whole operates under specific rules, such as the five-minute rule for debate, and allows for amendments to be made at any point during the discussion. It is often invoked for the consideration of measures from the Union calendar.\n\n### Select Committees\n1. **Composition**: Select Committees are typically composed of a smaller number of members, appointed for specific tasks. They are not made up of all members of the House or Senate.\n2. **Purpose**: These committees are established for a particular purpose, often to investigate specific issues or oversee certain functions that are beyond the capacity of standing committees. They can be temporary or permanent, depending on their mandate.\n3. **Functionality**: Select Committees often focus on investigative work, such as the Select Committee on Intelligence or the Select Committee on Ethics. They may have the authority to report legislation, but their primary role is usually oversight or investigation rather than the direct consideration of legislation.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Membership**: The Committee of the Whole includes all members of the House, while Select Committees consist of a smaller, appointed group.\n- **Function**: The Committee of the Whole is focused on the debate and amendment of legislation, whereas Select Committees are typically investigative and may not directly engage in the legislative process.\n- **Rules and Procedures**: The Committee of the Whole operates under more relaxed rules to expedite the legislative process, while Select Committees follow procedures defined by their specific mandates.\n\nIn summary, while both types of committees play crucial roles in the legislative process, they differ significantly in their composition, purpose, and functionality.
