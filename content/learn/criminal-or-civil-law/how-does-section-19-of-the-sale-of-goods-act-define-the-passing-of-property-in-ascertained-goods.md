answer: >-
    Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, addresses the passing of property in ascertained goods. It establishes that the property in specific or ascertained goods is transferred to the buyer at the time the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. This is articulated in the following sub-sections:\n\n1. **Intention of the Parties**: According to Section 19(1), the property passes when the parties intend it to pass. The intention can be determined by examining the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances surrounding the transaction.\n\n2. **Deliverable State**: If the goods are in a deliverable state, the property passes to the buyer regardless of payment or the time of delivery. This means that once the goods are ready for delivery and the buyer is aware of this, ownership is transferred.\n\n3. **Unascertained Goods**: It is important to note that if the contract involves unascertained goods, the property does not pass until the goods are ascertained, as specified in Section 18 of the Act.\n\nOverall, Section 19 emphasizes the significance of the parties' intentions in determining when ownership of ascertained goods is transferred, which is crucial for understanding the rights and obligations of both buyers and sellers in commercial transactions.
