    How have courts interpreted prosecutorial discretion in the context of suspension?
answer: >-
    Courts have interpreted prosecutorial discretion in the context of suspension through a lens of deference to the executive branch's authority. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently upheld the principle that prosecutors have broad discretion in deciding whether to initiate or pursue criminal charges. This discretion is rooted in the understanding that, as long as there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed, the decision to prosecute or not generally rests with the prosecutor.\n\nFor instance, in the case of *Linda R.S.*, the Court emphasized that a citizen lacks standing to challenge prosecutorial policies unless they are directly affected by prosecution. This highlights the limited role of the judiciary in reviewing prosecutorial decisions, as the courts are reluctant to interfere with the executive's discretion in these matters. The Court noted that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a complex area that is not easily subject to judicial review, as seen in *Newman v. United States*, where the D.C. Circuit Court stated that few subjects are less adaptable to judicial review than the executive's discretion in prosecutorial decisions.\n\nMoreover, the legislative branch has historically supported this broad interpretation of prosecutorial power, with many criminal laws designed to enhance rather than limit prosecutorial discretion. This has led to a situation where the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is seen as a central component of the federal criminal justice system, influencing case outcomes and plea negotiations significantly.\n\nIn summary, courts have interpreted prosecutorial discretion as a fundamental aspect of the separation of powers, granting the executive branch considerable latitude in deciding how to enforce the law, while simultaneously limiting the judiciary's ability to review these decisions. This framework underscores the importance of prosecutorial discretion in maintaining the balance of power within the U.S. legal system.
