    What distinguishes international law from domestic law?
answer: >-
    International law and domestic law are distinguished primarily by their scope, application, and the entities they govern.\n\n1. **Scope and Application**:\n   - **International Law**: This body of law governs the relationships and interactions between sovereign states and international organizations. It includes treaties, conventions, and customary international law that regulate issues such as trade, human rights, and environmental protection. For example, treaties between nations are governed by international law, which establishes obligations that states must adhere to in their interactions with one another.\n   - **Domestic Law**: In contrast, domestic law pertains to the legal framework within a specific country. It governs the behavior of individuals, organizations, and the government itself within that jurisdiction. Domestic laws can cover a wide range of areas, including criminal law, civil law, and administrative law, and are enforced by local courts and authorities.\n\n2. **Entities Governed**:\n   - **International Law**: Primarily concerns states and international entities. It regulates how countries interact with each other and sets standards for international conduct. For instance, international law may dictate how countries should respond to humanitarian crises or how they should conduct warfare.\n   - **Domestic Law**: Focuses on individuals and entities within a country. It establishes rights and responsibilities for citizens and organizations, such as laws governing contracts, property, and criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**:\n   - **International Law**: Enforcement can be complex, as there is no overarching authority to enforce international law universally. Compliance often relies on the willingness of states to adhere to international norms and the mechanisms of international organizations, such as the United Nations or the International Criminal Court.\n   - **Domestic Law**: Enforcement is typically more straightforward, as domestic laws are upheld by national courts and law enforcement agencies. Violations of domestic law can lead to legal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n\n4. **Legal Hierarchy**:\n   - **International Law**: In some jurisdictions, international law can take precedence over domestic law, especially when a country has ratified treaties that require compliance with international standards.\n   - **Domestic Law**: Generally holds authority within its jurisdiction, but may be influenced by international obligations, particularly in areas such as human rights.\n\nIn summary, international law regulates the conduct of states and international entities in their interactions, while domestic law governs the behavior of individuals and organizations within a specific country. The enforcement mechanisms and the entities involved further differentiate these two branches of law.
