answer: >-
    Real property refers to land and any permanent structures or improvements attached to it. Here are some examples of real property:\n\n1. **Land**: This includes any plots of land, whether developed or undeveloped.\n2. **Residential Buildings**: Homes, apartments, and condominiums that are permanently affixed to the land.\n3. **Commercial Buildings**: Office buildings, retail spaces, and warehouses that serve business purposes.\n4. **Industrial Properties**: Factories and manufacturing plants that are built on land.\n5. **Agricultural Land**: Farmland, which may include crops and livestock that are considered part of the real property.\n6. **Improvements**: Structures such as fences, roads, and parking lots that enhance the value of the land.\n7. **Natural Resources**: Rights to minerals, oil, or gas that lie beneath the land, as well as water rights associated with the property.\n\nReal property is distinguished from personal property, which includes movable items such as furniture, vehicles, and other tangible assets that are not permanently attached to the land. Understanding the distinction between these types of property is crucial in real estate transactions and property law.
