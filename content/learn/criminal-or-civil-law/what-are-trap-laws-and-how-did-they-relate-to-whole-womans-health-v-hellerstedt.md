    What are TRAP laws and how did they relate to Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt?
answer: >-
    TRAP laws, or Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, are legislative measures that impose specific and often burdensome requirements on abortion providers that are not applied to other medical practices. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, these laws are designed to create obstacles for women seeking abortions by enforcing regulations that are medically unnecessary and disproportionately affect abortion services.\n\nIn the landmark case Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 27, 2016, the Court ruled against Texas House Bill 2 (H.B. 2), which included several TRAP provisions. The law required that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic and that abortion facilities meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers. The Supreme Court found that these requirements imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, as they led to the closure of many clinics and significantly restricted access to safe and legal abortion services.\n\nThe Court's decision emphasized that the state failed to demonstrate that these regulations advanced the legitimate interest of protecting women's health. Instead, the evidence showed that the admitting privileges requirement did not improve health outcomes for women and only served to limit their access to abortion services. The ruling reaffirmed the constitutional right to access abortion and set a precedent that similar TRAP laws in other states could be challenged on the grounds of creating undue burdens on women’s reproductive rights. \n\nOverall, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt is a critical case in the ongoing legal battles surrounding reproductive rights, highlighting the impact of TRAP laws on women's autonomy and access to healthcare.
