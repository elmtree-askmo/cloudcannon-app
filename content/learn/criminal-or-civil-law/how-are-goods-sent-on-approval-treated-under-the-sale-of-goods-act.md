    How are goods sent on approval treated under the Sale of Goods Act?
answer: >-
    Under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, goods sent on approval or "on sale or return" are treated in a specific manner regarding the transfer of property. According to Section 24 of the Act, the property in such goods passes to the buyer under the following conditions:\n\n1. **Signification of Approval**: The property in the goods passes to the buyer when he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller. This can be done through explicit communication or any act that indicates acceptance of the goods.\n\n2. **Retention of Goods**: If the buyer does not signify his approval or acceptance but retains the goods, the property will also pass to him. This implies that mere retention of the goods without any communication of disapproval can lead to the transfer of ownership.\n\nThe Act distinguishes between two types of transactions in this context:\n- **Sale on Approval**: This occurs when goods are delivered primarily for use, allowing the buyer to assess their suitability.\n- **Sale or Return**: This occurs when goods are delivered primarily for resale, where the buyer has the option to return the goods even if they conform to the contract.\n\nIn summary, the Sale of Goods Act provides a clear framework for how goods sent on approval are treated, ensuring that ownership is transferred based on the buyer's actions regarding approval or retention of the goods.
