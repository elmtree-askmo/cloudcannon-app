    What are the current laws regarding possession and distribution of cannabis in Canada?
answer: >-
    As of October 17, 2018, Canada has implemented the Cannabis Act, which provides a legal framework for the possession, distribution, and production of cannabis for non-medical purposes. Here are the key points regarding the current laws on cannabis in Canada:\n\n1. **Legal Age and Possession Limits**: Adults who are 18 years of age or older can legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis in public. Additionally, they can possess up to 150 grams of fresh cannabis. There are no federal limits on how much cannabis an adult can store at home, provided it is obtained from legal sources.\n\n2. **Home Cultivation**: The Act permits adults to cultivate up to four cannabis plants per dwelling-house for personal use. They are also allowed to share up to 30 cannabis seeds and four non-flowering plants with other adults.\n\n3. **Distribution and Sale**: The federal government regulates the production and distribution of cannabis through licensed producers. Provinces and territories are responsible for the implementation and enforcement of their own regulations regarding the sale and distribution of cannabis. This includes setting up retail frameworks and determining the legal age for purchase, which may vary by region.\n\n4. **Cannabis Edibles and Concentrates**: As of October 17, 2019, cannabis edibles and concentrates became legal for sale, expanding the range of cannabis products available to consumers.\n\n5. **Impaired Driving Regulations**: The Cannabis Act includes provisions related to cannabis-impaired driving, which are integrated into Canadaâ€™s broader impaired driving legislation. This includes penalties for driving under the influence of cannabis.\n\n6. **Public Health and Safety Objectives**: The primary goals of the Cannabis Act are to keep cannabis out of the hands of youth, reduce the illegal market, and protect public health and safety by providing adults with access to a quality-controlled supply of cannabis.\n\n7. **Legal Sources of Cannabis**: By 2023, approximately 73% of respondents reported using legal sources for their cannabis, a significant increase from 37% in 2019. This indicates a growing acceptance and reliance on regulated cannabis markets.\n\n8. **Ongoing Review and Adjustments**: The Cannabis Act is subject to ongoing review, with recommendations being made to improve its administration and address emerging issues related to cannabis use and its impact on society.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official resources provided by Health Canada and other governmental publications regarding the Cannabis Act and its regulations.
