    The 50-50 presumption in time sharing arrangements refers to the legal assumption that parents should share equal time with their children post-separation or divorce, promoting stability and meaningful relationships. Deviations may occur due to factors like parental circumstances, child's specific needs, geographical distance, parental behavior, and child's preferences.

answer: >-
    The 50-50 presumption in time sharing arrangements refers to the legal assumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, parents should share equal time with their children after separation or divorce. This presumption is based on the belief that maintaining a close relationship with both parents is in the best interest of the child. Courts typically encourage arrangements that promote stability and allow children to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.\n\nHowever, deviations from this 50-50 presumption can occur under various circumstances. Some common reasons for deviations include:\n\n1. **Parental Circumstances**: If one parent has a significantly higher income or is more capable of providing for the child's needs, the court may adjust the time sharing arrangement to reflect this. For instance, a parent who works long hours or travels frequently may not be able to share equal time effectively.\n\n2. **Child's Needs**: The specific needs of the child, such as health issues or special needs (e.g., a child with Down syndrome), may necessitate a different arrangement that prioritizes stability and care.\n\n3. **Geographical Considerations**: If the parents live far apart, a 50-50 arrangement may not be practical. The court may consider the logistics of travel and the impact on the child's routine.\n\n4. **Parental Behavior**: If one parent has a history of substance abuse, domestic violence, or other behaviors that could endanger the child, the court may limit that parent's time sharing.\n\n5. **Child's Preference**: Depending on the child's age and maturity, their preferences may be taken into account, especially if they express a desire to spend more time with one parent.\n\n6. **Statutory Add-Ons**: Courts may also consider additional factors such as health insurance costs, unreimbursed medical expenses, and other financial obligations when determining child support and time sharing arrangements.\n\nIn summary, while the 50-50 presumption serves as a starting point for time sharing arrangements, various factors can lead to deviations based on the best interests of the child and the specific circumstances of the parents.
