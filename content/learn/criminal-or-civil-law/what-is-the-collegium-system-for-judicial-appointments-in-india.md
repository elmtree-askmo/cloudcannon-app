    What is the collegium system for judicial appointments in India?
answer: >-
    The collegium system in India is a mechanism for the appointment and transfer of judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts. It was established through a series of Supreme Court judgments known as the "Three Judges Cases," which collectively shaped the process of judicial appointments in the country.\n\nUnder the collegium system, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and a group of four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court form the Collegium. This body is responsible for recommending appointments and transfers of judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts. Specifically, Article 124(2) of the Indian Constitution mandates that judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President of India after consultation with the CJI and other judges as deemed necessary. Similarly, Article 217 outlines the appointment process for High Court judges, which involves consultation with the CJI, the Governor of the State, and the Chief Justice of the High Court.\n\nThe collegium system has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability. In response to these concerns, the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was proposed through the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act in 2014. The NJAC aimed to create a more transparent and inclusive process for judicial appointments, consisting of the CJI, two senior-most Supreme Court judges, the Union Minister of Law and Justice, and two eminent persons from civil society. However, the NJAC was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, which ruled it unconstitutional, thereby reaffirming the collegium system.\n\nIn summary, the collegium system is a significant aspect of India's judicial framework, ensuring that the appointment and transfer of judges are managed by existing members of the judiciary, although it has been a subject of ongoing debate regarding its effectiveness and transparency.
