    What is the rule of comity among judges in the context of High Court decisions?
answer: >-
    In the context of High Court decisions, the rule of comity among judges refers to the practice where High Court judges strive to follow the decisions made by their fellow judges, even though they are not legally bound to do so. This practice is based on principles of courtesy and politeness rather than a strict rule of law. \n\nIn Singapore's legal system, the High Court is bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal, which establishes a clear vertical stare decisis. However, when it comes to horizontal stare decisis—where a court is expected to follow its own previous decisions—the High Court is not bound to adhere to its own past rulings. Instead, High Court judges may choose to follow the decisions of their colleagues as a matter of comity, which promotes consistency and predictability in legal interpretations and rulings.\n\nThis approach helps maintain a level of coherence within the High Court's decisions, fostering a collaborative judicial environment. However, it is important to note that this practice does not create a binding precedent; rather, it reflects a mutual respect among judges for each other's rulings, which can enhance the overall integrity of the judicial process.
