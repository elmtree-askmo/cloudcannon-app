    What are the specific allegations against the Karnataka Chief Minister?
answer: >-
    The specific allegations against Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah primarily revolve around corruption related to the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). The key points of the allegations include:\n\n1. **Prosecution Sanction**: On August 16, 2024, Karnataka Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot granted sanction for Siddaramaiah's prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act, based on complaints from private individuals. This sanction has been challenged by Siddaramaiah in the Karnataka High Court.\n\n2. **Land Allotment Investigation**: The allegations include irregularities in the allotment of land to Siddaramaiah's wife in 2021, during a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in power. The Karnataka High Court upheld the Governor's order allowing an investigation into this matter.\n\n3. **MUDA's 50:50 Scheme**: It is alleged that Siddaramaiah tailored the MUDA's 50:50 scheme, which allowed his wife to receive 14 housing plots in a developed locality. This scheme was officially adopted by MUDA in 2020, but it is claimed that Siddaramaiah influenced its creation during his previous tenure as Chief Minister from 2013 to 2018.\n\n4. **High Court Rulings**: The Karnataka High Court has dismissed Siddaramaiah's petition challenging the Governor's permission for the investigation, marking a significant setback for him.\n\nThese allegations have led to calls for his resignation from opposition parties, particularly the BJP, following the court's decisions. The ongoing legal proceedings and investigations are likely to have significant implications for his political career.
