    What are the most recent security operations conducted against Naxalites?
answer: >-
    Recent security operations against Naxalites in India have seen significant developments, particularly in the Chhattisgarh region, which is known as a stronghold for these insurgents. Here are some key highlights from the latest operations:\n\n1. **Casualties and Operations**: In a notable operation, at least 31 Naxalites were killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh, marking one of the most successful operations against them in recent times. This success is part of a broader trend, as the violence associated with Left Wing Extremism has reportedly decreased by 72% and deaths by 86% in 2023 compared to 2010.\n\n2. **Recent Attacks**: Despite these successes, Naxalites have continued to carry out attacks. For instance, on April 26, 2023, a blast in Dantewada district resulted in the deaths of ten police personnel and a driver, highlighting the ongoing risks faced by security forces in the region.\n\n3. **Ongoing Operations**: As of December 2023, security forces have killed 68 Naxals in separate encounters in the Bastar region, which includes seven districts such as Kanker. The proactive measures taken by the state government since the formation of the Vishnu Deo Sai government have led to the elimination of at least 80 Naxals, with over 125 arrests and 150 surrenders reported since January 2024.\n\n4. **Joint Operations**: Security forces, including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and state police, have been conducting joint operations. For example, on September 28, 2023, a CRPF soldier was killed in an IED blast during a joint operation in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum district.\n\n5. **Overall Impact**: The cumulative effect of these operations indicates a significant decline in Naxalite activity, although the insurgency is not yet fully eradicated. The Indian government continues to treat the Naxalite insurgency as a major internal security challenge, with ongoing efforts to innovate and adapt strategies to counter this threat effectively.\n\nThese operations reflect a concerted effort by Indian security forces to combat the Naxalite insurgency, which has been described as one of the most significant internal security challenges faced by the country.
