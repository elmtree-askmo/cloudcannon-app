    What are some notable school prayer cases related to the Establishment Clause?
answer: >-
    Notable school prayer cases related to the Establishment Clause primarily revolve around two landmark Supreme Court decisions: **Engel v. Vitale** and **School District of Abington Township v. Schempp**.\n\n1. **Engel v. Vitale (1962)**: This case involved a New York State law that encouraged public schools to begin each day with a nondenominational prayer composed by the New York Board of Regents. The Supreme Court ruled that this practice violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, stating that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and promote its recitation in public schools. The Court emphasized that the government should not be involved in composing or endorsing religious prayers, regardless of whether students had the option to opt out of participation.\n\n2. **School District of Abington Township v. Schempp (1963)**: Following Engel, this case further solidified the prohibition of state-sponsored religious activities in public schools. The Supreme Court ruled that a Pennsylvania law requiring public schools to conduct Bible readings and recite the Lord's Prayer at the beginning of each school day was unconstitutional. The Court held that such practices were inherently religious and thus violated the Establishment Clause, reinforcing the principle that public schools must remain neutral in matters of religion.\n\nThese cases established a clear precedent that state-sponsored prayer in public schools is unconstitutional, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a separation between church and state in educational settings. Subsequent legal developments have continued to explore the boundaries of religious expression in schools, but Engel and Schempp remain foundational in the discourse surrounding the Establishment Clause and school prayer.
