answer: >-
    The key constitutional provisions related to social justice policies in the Philippines are primarily found in Article XIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which is dedicated to Social Justice and Human Rights. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Promotion of Human Dignity**: Section 1 emphasizes that Congress must prioritize measures that protect and enhance the right of all people to human dignity. This includes efforts to reduce social, economic, and political inequalities and to eliminate cultural inequities.\n\n2. **Equitable Distribution of Wealth and Power**: The Constitution mandates the equitable diffusion of wealth and political power for the common good, aiming to create a more just society.\n\n3. **Economic Opportunities**: The promotion of social justice includes a commitment to create economic opportunities based on freedom of initiative and self-reliance. This reflects the state's role in fostering an environment where individuals can thrive economically.\n\n4. **Labor Rights**: Section 3 of Article XIII states that the State shall afford full protection to labor, both local and overseas, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all. This highlights the importance of labor rights within the framework of social justice.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Approach**: The Constitution outlines that the promotion of social justice should encompass various aspects of national development, ensuring that policies are inclusive and address the needs of marginalized sectors of society.\n\nThese provisions collectively underscore the Philippine government's commitment to social justice as a fundamental principle guiding its policies and actions, aiming to create a more equitable and humane society.
