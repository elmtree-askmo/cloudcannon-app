    What legal proceedings have taken place regarding the NCP symbol dispute?
answer: >-
    The legal proceedings regarding the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) symbol dispute have involved significant intervention from the Supreme Court of India. The conflict primarily arises between two factions of the NCP: one led by veteran leader Sharad Pawar and the other by his nephew, Ajit Pawar. Here are the key developments in the legal proceedings:\n\n1. **Supreme Court Intervention**: The Supreme Court has been actively involved in addressing the dispute over the use of the NCP's iconic "clock" symbol. The court has issued notices to Ajit Pawar and his faction, seeking responses regarding the claims made by Sharad Pawar's faction.\n\n2. **Election Commission's Recognition**: The crux of the legal battle stems from a February 6 order by the Election Commission, which recognized Ajit Pawar's group as the "real" NCP and granted them the right to use the "clock" symbol. This decision has been challenged by Sharad Pawar's faction in the Supreme Court.\n\n3. **Compliance Orders**: The Supreme Court has directed the Ajit Pawar faction to publish a disclaimer within a specified timeframe, indicating that the use of the "clock" symbol is under legal dispute. The court has emphasized the need for transparency and compliance with its orders.\n\n4. **Adjournments and Hearings**: The Supreme Court has adjourned hearings on multiple occasions due to procedural issues, such as the improper submission of requisite documents. The court has also instructed the Ajit Pawar faction to file a fresh undertaking to comply with its earlier directives.\n\n5. **Symbol Allocation**: In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court has instructed that the Sharad Pawar faction should use the name "NCP (Sharad Pawar)" and the symbol "man blowing turha (trumpet)" instead of the "clock" symbol, which is currently under dispute.\n\n6. **Ongoing Legal Battle**: The legal proceedings are ongoing, with the Supreme Court continuing to monitor compliance with its orders and the overall dispute between the two factions.\n\nThese developments highlight the complexities of the legal proceedings surrounding the NCP symbol dispute, reflecting the broader political tensions within the party.
