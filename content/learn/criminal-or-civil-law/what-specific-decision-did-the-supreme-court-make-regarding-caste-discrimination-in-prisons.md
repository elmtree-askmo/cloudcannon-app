    What specific decision did the Supreme Court make regarding caste discrimination in prisons?
answer: >-
    On December 12, 2023, the Supreme Court of India made a significant ruling regarding caste discrimination in prisons. The Court declared that caste-based discrimination, including the segregation of prisoners and the assignment of work based on caste hierarchy, is unconstitutional. This decision was prompted by a writ petition filed by Shantha, which challenged various state prison manuals that perpetuated caste-based division of labor and discrimination against de-notified tribes (DNT) by labeling them as "habitual offenders," a classification rooted in colonial practices.\n\nThe Supreme Court emphasized that the assignment of labor based on caste was not voluntary and constituted "forced labor," which is prohibited under Article 23 of the Indian Constitution. The Court found that such practices violate the fundamental human dignity and personality of inmates, as they amount to untouchability, which is forbidden under Article 17 of the Constitution.\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court ordered the central and state governments to revise their prison manuals within three months to eliminate provisions that promote caste discrimination. The Court's decision reflects a commitment to uphold the dignity and equality of all individuals, including those incarcerated, and to ensure that no stigma is attached to any person based on their caste.
