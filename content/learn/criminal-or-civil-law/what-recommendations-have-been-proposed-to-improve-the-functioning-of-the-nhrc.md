    What recommendations have been proposed to improve the functioning of the NHRC?
answer: >-
    To improve the functioning of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India, several recommendations have been proposed based on various discussions and reports. Here are some key suggestions:\n\n1. **Alignment with International Standards**: The NHRC should enhance its processes and functions in accordance with the United Nations Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions, commonly known as the Paris Principles. This alignment would help strengthen its credibility and effectiveness as a human rights body.\n\n2. **Constitutional Status**: There is a recommendation to elevate the NHRC to a constitutional body, similar to the South African Human Rights Commission. This change could provide it with greater authority and independence, enhancing its ability to protect human rights.\n\n3. **Binding Recommendations**: Currently, the NHRC's recommendations are non-binding, which limits its influence. Making its recommendations legally binding could compel authorities to take necessary actions in response to human rights violations.\n\n4. **Proactive Approach**: The NHRC often responds reactively to complaints. A shift towards a more proactive approach, including preventive measures and early interventions, could significantly enhance its impact on human rights protection.\n\n5. **Reporting Mechanism**: It has been suggested that the NHRC's annual reports should be tabled in Parliament. This would ensure greater accountability and transparency, as well as facilitate governmental action based on the NHRC's findings and recommendations.\n\n6. **Broaden Mandate**: Expanding the NHRC's mandate to address emerging human rights challenges more effectively is crucial. This could include issues related to digital rights, human trafficking, and other contemporary concerns.\n\n7. **Capacity Building**: Continuous training and capacity-building programs for NHRC staff and state human rights commissions can improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness in handling human rights issues.\n\n8. **Strengthening Independence**: Experts have called for reforms to bolster the NHRC's independence and credibility, ensuring that it can operate without undue influence from the government or other entities.\n\nThese recommendations aim to enhance the NHRC's role as a protector and promoter of human rights in India, addressing its current limitations and challenges.
