    What is the undue burden standard established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey?
answer: >-
    The undue burden standard was established in the landmark Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). This standard serves as a legal test to evaluate whether state laws imposing restrictions on abortion violate the constitutional rights of women as protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAccording to the ruling, a law is considered unconstitutional if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus reaches viability. This means that while states have the authority to regulate abortions, they cannot enact laws that significantly hinder a woman's ability to obtain an abortion prior to viability.\n\nThe Court's decision in Casey reaffirmed the essential holding of Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's right to choose an abortion, but it also rejected the trimester framework established in Roe. Instead, the Casey ruling emphasized that the state has legitimate interests in protecting the health of the mother and the potential life of the fetus, but these interests must be balanced against a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nThe undue burden standard has been influential in subsequent legal cases regarding reproductive rights, as it allows for some regulation of abortion while still protecting women's access to this medical procedure. However, it has also opened the door for various state laws that may impose restrictions on abortion access, leading to ongoing legal and political debates surrounding reproductive rights in the United States. \n\nIn summary, the undue burden standard is a critical component of the legal framework governing abortion rights, establishing that any state law that creates significant obstacles for women seeking abortions before viability is unconstitutional.
