answer: >-
    In Tennessee, the penalties for driving without a valid driver's license can vary based on the specific circumstances of the offense. Generally, driving without a license is classified as a Class C misdemeanor. This can result in penalties that include:\n\n- A fine of up to $50\n- Possible incarceration for up to 30 days in jail\n\nAdditionally, if a driver is found to be operating a vehicle without having their license in their possession, they may also face similar penalties, including a $10 fine plus court costs.\n\nIt's important to note that driving with a suspended or revoked license is considered a more serious offense, classified as a Class B misdemeanor, which can lead to more severe penalties, including potential jail time ranging from 6 months to a year.\n\nFor further details, you may refer to Tennessee Code Annotated ยง 55-50-301, which outlines the requirements for operating a motor vehicle in the state.
