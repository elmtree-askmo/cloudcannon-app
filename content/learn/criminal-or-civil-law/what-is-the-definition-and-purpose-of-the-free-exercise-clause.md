    What is the definition and purpose of the Free Exercise Clause?
answer: >-
    The Free Exercise Clause is a provision in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution that states, "Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]." Its primary purpose is to protect individuals' rights to practice their religion freely without government interference. This clause ensures that individuals can hold, practice, and change their religious beliefs according to their conscience.\n\nThe Free Exercise Clause prohibits Congress from enacting laws that would restrict religious practices, but it also allows for some regulation of religious conduct when necessary for the protection of society. The Supreme Court has established various standards to determine when such regulations may unduly infringe upon constitutional rights, focusing on factors like discrimination, coercion, and incidental effects on religious practices.\n\nIn essence, the Free Exercise Clause serves to balance the government's interest in maintaining order and protecting societal welfare with the individual's right to religious freedom. It is often examined in conjunction with the Establishment Clause, which prevents the government from endorsing or establishing a religion, highlighting the tension between government authority and individual religious liberties.
