    How has India contributed to the GlobE Network in its anti-corruption efforts?
answer: >-
    India has made significant contributions to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE Network), which is an initiative launched under the G20 framework to combat international corruption and financial crime. Officially launched on June 3, 2021, during the UN General Assembly Special Session against Corruption, the GlobE Network serves as a vital platform for international cooperation among law enforcement agencies.\n\nOne of the key contributions of India to the GlobE Network is its election to the 15-member steering committee, which occurred during a plenary session in Beijing. This election positions India in a pivotal role to influence the global anti-corruption agenda and asset recovery efforts. As a member of the steering committee, India is expected to leverage its expertise and experience in combating corruption, which will be valuable assets to the network.\n\nIndia's participation in the GlobE Network strengthens its efforts to address cross-border financial crimes and corruption. The country aims to play a critical role in shaping the global agenda on anti-corruption, focusing on issues such as money laundering, asset recovery, and beneficial ownership. This involvement not only enhances India's standing in international diplomacy but also aligns with its broader goals of promoting transparency and accountability in governance.\n\nOverall, India's active engagement in the GlobE Network reflects its commitment to global anti-corruption efforts and its role as a leader in the fight against corruption on an international scale.
