    What were the circumstances surrounding Madison Rutherford's disappearance?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford, originally named John Sankey, was a financial adviser who became notorious for his involvement in fraudulent activities, including a failed scheme to collect $7 million in insurance funds. After serving time in prison for these fraud convictions, he changed his name to Madison Rutherford and attempted to reinvent himself.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his disappearance are tied to his complex history of deception and identity change. Following his release from prison in 2006, he opened a bar called Bey's Sports Bar in Columbia, South Carolina, under his new identity. However, his past continued to haunt him, and he was implicated in various financial crimes.\n\nIn the context of forensic investigation, the case of Madison Rutherford highlights the role of forensic anthropology in uncovering the truth behind fraudulent claims and disappearances. Forensic experts were able to analyze evidence related to his activities, revealing the extent of his deception and the impact on his victims, including those from whom he had stolen life savings.\n\nThe Forensic Files episode titled "Past Lives," which aired in 2004, delves into these themes, showcasing how forensic science can play a crucial role in criminal investigations, particularly in cases involving identity and deception.
