    What judicial powers are vested in the Indian Parliament?
answer: >-
    The Indian Parliament, while primarily a legislative body, does possess certain judicial powers and functions that are significant within the framework of the Constitution. Here are the key aspects of the judicial powers vested in the Indian Parliament:\n\n1. **Judicial Review**: Although the power of judicial review is primarily exercised by the judiciary, the Parliament has a role in this context. The Constitution empowers the judiciary to review laws passed by Parliament to ensure they comply with constitutional provisions. This is articulated in Articles 13, 32, and 226, among others. The Parliament cannot enact laws that violate fundamental rights, and the judiciary can strike down such laws.\n\n2. **Amendment of the Constitution**: The Parliament has the sovereign power to amend the Constitution, which includes provisions related to the judiciary. This power is subject to certain restrictions, particularly those that safeguard the basic structure of the Constitution, as established in the landmark Keshavananda Bharati case. This means that while Parliament can legislate on judicial matters, it cannot alter the fundamental framework that governs the judiciary.\n\n3. **Legislative Oversight**: The Parliament can legislate on matters concerning the judiciary, including the establishment of courts, the appointment of judges, and the regulation of judicial procedures. This legislative power allows Parliament to act as a check on the judiciary, ensuring that judicial functions align with legislative intent.\n\n4. **Privileges and Immunities**: Under Article 105, Parliament has the power to expel its members, which can be seen as a form of judicial power within its own domain. This power is exercised in accordance with the privileges and immunities granted to Parliament, allowing it to maintain order and discipline among its members.\n\n5. **Judicial Accountability**: The Parliament can legislate to ensure accountability within the judiciary. This includes laws that govern the conduct of judges and mechanisms for addressing complaints against judicial misconduct.\n\nIn summary, while the Indian Parliament does not possess direct judicial powers akin to those of the judiciary, it plays a crucial role in shaping the judicial landscape through its legislative authority, oversight functions, and constitutional amendment powers. The relationship between the Parliament and the judiciary is characterized by a balance of powers, where each body checks the other to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law.
