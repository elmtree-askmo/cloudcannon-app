    What was the ruling in United States v. O’Brien and its impact on symbolic speech?
answer: >-
    In the landmark case of **United States v. O'Brien**, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal law prohibiting the burning of draft cards did not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The case arose when David Paul O'Brien publicly burned his draft card as a protest against the Vietnam War, leading to his prosecution under a federal statute that made it illegal to mutilate draft cards.\n\nThe Court acknowledged that O'Brien's act was expressive conduct, qualifying as "symbolic speech." However, it upheld the law by applying what is now known as the **O'Brien test**, which determines whether a law that restricts symbolic speech is constitutional. The test requires that the regulation must:\n\n1. Be within the constitutional power of the government.\n2. Further an important or substantial governmental interest.\n3. Be unrelated to the suppression of free expression.\n4. Not be more extensive than necessary to serve that governmental interest.\n\nIn this case, the Court found that the government's interest in maintaining an efficient and effective draft system justified the prohibition against burning draft cards, as it was essential for the government's ability to raise an army.\n\nThe impact of the O'Brien decision on symbolic speech jurisprudence was significant. It established a framework for evaluating laws that may infringe upon expressive conduct, balancing governmental interests against First Amendment rights. Following this ruling, the Supreme Court addressed other forms of symbolic speech, such as flag burning in **Texas v. Johnson** (1989), further shaping the legal landscape surrounding First Amendment protections.\n\nDespite the ruling, the act of burning draft cards continued to be a popular form of protest throughout the 1960s and 1970s, illustrating the ongoing tension between government regulations and individual expressions of dissent.
