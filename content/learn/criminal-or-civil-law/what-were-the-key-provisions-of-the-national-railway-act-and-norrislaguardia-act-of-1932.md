    What were the key provisions of the National Railway Act and Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932?
answer: >-
    The National Railway Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 were significant pieces of legislation in the evolution of labor laws in the United States, particularly concerning labor relations and the rights of workers.\n\n### National Railway Act\nThe National Railway Act, often associated with the Railway Labor Act, was designed to govern labor relations in the railroad and airline industries. Key provisions include:\n\n1. **Promotion of Collective Bargaining**: The Act aimed to substitute bargaining, arbitration, and mediation for strikes to resolve labor disputes, thereby promoting peaceful negotiations between employers and employees.\n2. **Protection of Workers' Rights**: It sought to ensure that employees had the freedom to associate and organize without interference from employers.\n3. **Establishment of a Mediation Board**: Initially enforced under the Board of Mediation, the Act later established a National Mediation Board to oversee disputes and facilitate negotiations.\n\n### Norris-LaGuardia Act\nThe Norris-LaGuardia Act, also known as the Anti-Injunction Act, was enacted to protect the rights of labor unions and their members. Its key provisions include:\n\n1. **Ban on Yellow-Dog Contracts**: The Act outlawed yellow-dog contracts, which were agreements that required workers not to join a union as a condition of employment.\n2. **Restrictions on Court Injunctions**: It significantly limited the ability of federal courts to issue injunctions against nonviolent labor activities, such as strikes, picketing, and boycotts. This was aimed at preventing employers from using the courts to suppress union activities.\n3. **Freedom of Association**: The Act declared that members of labor unions should have "full freedom of association," ensuring that their rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining were protected from employer interference.\n\nOverall, both acts played a crucial role in shaping labor relations in the United States by enhancing the rights of workers and limiting the power of employers and the judiciary in labor disputes.
