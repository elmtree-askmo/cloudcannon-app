    What legal actions have been taken regarding quarrying activities in Kerala?
answer: >-
    In Kerala, several legal actions have been taken regarding quarrying activities, primarily through the Kerala High Court. Here are some key developments:\n\n1. **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)**: The Kerala High Court disposed of a PIL filed by the Environmental Protection Forum, which sought to stop unauthorized quarrying activities in Vengoor West village. This case highlighted the need for regulatory oversight in quarrying operations.\n\n2. **Land Assignment Regulations**: The High Court ruled that no quarrying activities are permitted on lands assigned for cultivation under the Kerala Land Assignment Act. This ruling emphasizes the priority of land use regulations over quarrying leases, reinforcing the need for compliance with agricultural land use.\n\n3. **Environmental Concerns**: In the case of All Kerala River Protection Council v. State Of Kerala, the court addressed the intersection of environmental conservation and mining activities. The court has been active in ensuring that quarrying does not threaten protected monuments and complies with the Kerala Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1968.\n\n4. **Clarifications on Quarrying Regulations**: The court clarified that quarrying operations must adhere to approved mining plans and follow the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of Illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015. This includes restrictions on operational hours and the requirement for rainwater harvesting facilities.\n\n5. **Quashing of NGT Orders**: The Kerala High Court quashed an order from the National Green Tribunal that increased the minimum distance of quarries from residential areas from 50 meters to 200 meters, indicating a complex relationship between environmental regulations and local governance.\n\nThese legal actions reflect ongoing concerns about the environmental impact of quarrying in Kerala and the need for stringent regulatory frameworks to manage these activities effectively.
