    What are the main characteristics, procedures, and requirements of the law on euthanasia in Spain?
answer: >-
    In Spain, euthanasia is regulated by the Organic Law for the Regulation of Euthanasia (LO 3/2021), which was approved by the Cortes Generales in March 2021 and came into effect on June 25, 2021. This law makes Spain the fourth European country to legalize euthanasia and the first to introduce an ex ante procedure for its implementation.\n\n### Main Characteristics of the Law\n1. **Definition**: Euthanasia is defined as the action that directly and actively causes the death of a person, performed by health personnel. This can be done either by administering a substance that causes death or by prescribing it for the patient to self-administer.\n\n2. **Legal Framework**: The law is grounded in the Spanish Constitution, which mandates the protection and development of fundamental rights. It aims to provide a legal framework for individuals seeking to end their lives under specific circumstances.\n\n3. **Inclusion in Health Benefits**: Euthanasia has been included as one of the benefits of the Spanish health system, although its implementation may vary across different autonomous communities.\n\n### Procedures and Requirements\n1. **Eligibility**: To qualify for euthanasia, individuals must meet certain criteria, including:\n   - Being of legal age (18 years or older).\n   - Suffering from a serious and incurable condition or a debilitating illness that causes unbearable suffering.\n   - Being in a situation where the request for euthanasia is voluntary and well-considered.\n\n2. **Request Process**: The process involves several steps:\n   - The patient must submit a formal request for euthanasia, which can be made verbally or in writing.\n   - A second request is required, ensuring that the decision is consistent and voluntary.\n   - The attending physician must assess the request and consult with a second physician to confirm that all requirements are met.\n\n3. **Consultation and Approval**: After the initial assessment, a consulting doctor evaluates the case to ensure compliance with the law. If approved, the procedure can be carried out by the health personnel.\n\n4. **Documentation**: All requests and procedures must be documented thoroughly to ensure transparency and adherence to legal standards.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Spanish law on euthanasia represents a significant development in bioethical and legal considerations surrounding end-of-life choices. It reflects a growing recognition of individual autonomy and the right to die with dignity, while also establishing safeguards to prevent misuse. The law's implementation has been subject to ongoing discussions and evaluations, particularly regarding its application across different regions of Spain.
