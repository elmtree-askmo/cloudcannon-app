    What are the recent Supreme Court rulings on property demolitions?
answer: >-
    Recently, the Supreme Court of India has made significant rulings regarding property demolitions, particularly in the context of state authorities demolishing properties of individuals accused of crimes. On November 13, 2024, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court established a series of guidelines aimed at ensuring that due process is followed before any demolition takes place.\n\nKey points from the Supreme Court's ruling include:\n\n1. **Mandatory Show Cause Notice**: The Court ruled that no demolition should occur without a prior show cause notice that must be returnable within a minimum of 15 days. This is intended to provide property owners an opportunity to respond before any action is taken against their property.\n\n2. **Criticism of Arbitrary Demolitions**: The Supreme Court strongly criticized the practice of demolishing properties of suspected criminals, which has been perceived as a form of punitive justice. The Court emphasized that such actions often bypass established legal procedures and disproportionately affect minority communities.\n\n3. **Guidelines for Demolitions**: The Court laid down specific guidelines to govern the demolition process. These include:\n   - Issuing a 15-day advance notice to the property owner.\n   - Video recording the demolition procedure.\n   - Publicly displaying the spot report and providing avenues for legal challenge.\n\n4. **Constitutional Protections**: The Supreme Court underscored that it is unconstitutional to demolish a person's property without adhering to due process of law, reinforcing the foundational principles of justice and legal rights.\n\nThese rulings reflect the Court's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and ensuring that state actions are conducted within the framework of the law. The guidelines aim to prevent arbitrary actions by state authorities and to uphold the rule of law in property-related matters.
