    What was the Supreme Court's ruling regarding the Bangladesh Quota System Protests?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of Bangladesh recently ruled to significantly reduce the controversial quota system for government job applicants, which had been a focal point of widespread protests and unrest. The court's decision came after days of violent clashes between police and demonstrators, resulting in numerous fatalities. \n\nSpecifically, the Supreme Court ordered that the veterans' quota be cut to 5%, with 93% of government job allocations to be based on merit. This ruling overturned a previous High Court decision that had reinstated a 30% quota system, which had sparked the protests. The protests, primarily led by students, had escalated into violent confrontations, leading to at least 139 deaths according to reports.\n\nThis ruling is seen as a partial victory for the student protesters who had been advocating for a more equitable job allocation system, emphasizing merit over quotas. The Supreme Court's decision reflects a significant shift in the approach to government employment in Bangladesh, aiming to address the concerns raised by the demonstrators.
