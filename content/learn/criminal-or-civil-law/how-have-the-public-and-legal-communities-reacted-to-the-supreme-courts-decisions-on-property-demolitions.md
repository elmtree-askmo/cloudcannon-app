    How have the public and legal communities reacted to the Supreme Court's decisions on property demolitions?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India has recently taken a strong stance against the practice of property demolitions carried out by state authorities as a punitive measure against individuals accused of crimes. This practice, often referred to as "bulldozer justice," has faced significant criticism for allegedly targeting minority communities, particularly Muslims. \n\nIn its recent rulings, the Supreme Court condemned arbitrary demolitions, emphasizing that such actions violate constitutional principles and legal rights. The Court laid down a series of guidelines to ensure that due process is followed before any property demolition occurs. These guidelines include requirements for a 15-day advance notice, video recording of the demolition process, and the public display of reports that outline the reasons for the demolition and avenues for legal challenge.\n\nThe legal community has largely welcomed these decisions, viewing them as a reinforcement of the rule of law and a necessary check on executive power. The Court's emphasis on due process signifies a commitment to protecting the rights of individuals, asserting that the state cannot act as judge and jury in these matters. This reaction reflects a broader concern about the misuse of state power and the need for accountability in the enforcement of laws.\n\nPublic reaction has also been significant, with many expressing relief at the Supreme Court's intervention. The guidelines are seen as a step towards curbing the misuse of demolitions as a form of retributive justice, which has been increasingly reported in various states across India. The Court's decisions are viewed as a crucial move to uphold the rights of citizens and prevent the arbitrary exercise of power by state authorities.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court's rulings on property demolitions have sparked a dialogue about the balance between law enforcement and individual rights, highlighting the importance of judicial oversight in maintaining democratic principles.
