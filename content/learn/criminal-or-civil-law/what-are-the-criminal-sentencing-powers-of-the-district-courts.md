    What are the criminal sentencing powers of the District Courts?
answer: >-
    The District Courts in Singapore have specific criminal sentencing powers that are distinct from their jurisdiction to hear cases. Here are the key points regarding their sentencing powers:\n\n1. **Jurisdiction to Hear Cases**: The District Courts can hear criminal cases where the maximum imprisonment term does not exceed 10 years or where the offense is punishable by a fine only.\n\n2. **Sentencing Powers**: The sentencing powers of the District Courts are as follows:\n   - Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.\n   - A fine not exceeding $30,000.\n   - Up to 12 strokes of the cane.\n   - Any lawful sentence that combines any of the above sentences which the court is authorized to impose.\n\nThis means that while the District Courts can hear cases with a maximum punishment of 10 years, they can only impose a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison. This distinction is important as it highlights that a court's jurisdiction to hear a case does not necessarily equate to its power to impose the maximum sentence associated with that case. \n\nIn summary, the District Courts play a crucial role in the judicial system by handling a significant volume of criminal cases while operating within defined limits regarding sentencing.
