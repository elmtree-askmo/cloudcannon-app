    What concerns has the Supreme Court raised about judicial appointments in India?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India has raised several significant concerns regarding judicial appointments in the country. These concerns primarily revolve around the following issues:\n\n1. **Government Delays**: The Supreme Court has highlighted a substantial backlog of judicial appointments, with around 70 High Court Collegium recommendations pending with the government for over 10 months. This delay has led to a talent drain, as many prospective candidates withdraw their applications due to the inaction of the government.\n\n2. **"Pick and Choose" Approach**: The Court has criticized the central government's selective acceptance of names from the Collegium's proposals for judicial appointments. This approach disrupts the seniority of candidates recommended for judgeships, which is a critical aspect of maintaining the integrity and fairness of the judicial appointment process.\n\n3. **Impact on Judiciary**: The delays and the government's approach have not only affected the appointment of judges but have also contributed to a significant vacancy rate in the High Courts, with approximately 30% of judge positions remaining unfilled. This situation exacerbates the backlog of cases, with millions of cases pending in various courts.\n\n4. **Collegium System vs. NJAC**: The Supreme Court has defended the existing Collegium system for judicial appointments, especially in light of the government's push for the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). The NJAC was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, and the Court has emphasized the need to uphold the Collegium system, which it believes is essential for maintaining judicial independence.\n\nThese concerns reflect the ongoing tension between the judiciary and the executive in India regarding the appointment of judges, highlighting the need for a more efficient and transparent process to ensure the timely filling of judicial vacancies and the overall health of the judicial system.
