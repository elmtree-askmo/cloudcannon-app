    How does the retributive system address victim needs compared to the restorative system?
answer: >-
    The retributive and restorative justice systems address victim needs in fundamentally different ways, reflecting their distinct philosophies and objectives.\n\n**Retributive Justice:**\nRetributive justice primarily focuses on punishment and deterrence. It operates on the principle that offenders should be held accountable for their actions through legal penalties, which are determined by judges and legal professionals. While this system acknowledges the victim's right to seek justice, it often does so in a manner that may not directly address the emotional and psychological needs of the victim. Victims may experience a sense of closure through the punishment of the offender, but their personal experiences, feelings, and needs are not central to the process. The focus is more on the crime itself and the offender's culpability rather than on the victim's healing or restoration.\n\n**Restorative Justice:**\nIn contrast, restorative justice places the victim at the center of the process. It aims to address the emotional and psychological needs of victims by promoting healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Restorative justice allows victims to actively participate in the resolution process, giving them a voice to express their experiences and feelings. This approach focuses on repairing the harm caused by the crime, which can empower victims and contribute to their healing. By involving victims in discussions about how to address the harm, restorative justice fosters a sense of closure and can help victims regain a sense of control over their lives.\n\nIn summary, while retributive justice may provide a sense of closure through punishment, it often overlooks the victim's emotional needs. Restorative justice, on the other hand, actively seeks to meet those needs by involving victims in the process and focusing on healing and restoration. This victim-centered approach can lead to more meaningful outcomes for those affected by crime.
