    Are there restrictions on the use of parking lights or auxiliary fog lights?
answer: >-
    Yes, there are restrictions on the use of parking lights and auxiliary fog lights, which vary by state and local regulations. \n\n1. **Parking Lights**: The use of parking lights is generally regulated to ensure they are used appropriately and do not cause distractions to other drivers. Specific regulations may dictate when and how parking lights can be used, such as during low visibility conditions or when parked. It is important to check local laws to avoid potential violations.\n\n2. **Auxiliary Fog Lights**: Auxiliary fog lights are subject to specific requirements regarding their installation and use. For instance, fog lamps must be mounted at a height between 12 to 30 inches and aimed so that the high-intensity portion of the beam does not project higher than four inches below the level of the center of the lamp at a distance of 25 feet. Additionally, drivers are advised to turn off auxiliary lights in well-lit areas to prevent distracting other drivers.\n\n3. **General Restrictions**: Many states have laws that restrict the use of lights that project a beam with an intensity brighter than 300 candlepower unless they are specifically designated as headlamps, spotlamps, or other types of approved lighting. \n\n4. **State-Specific Regulations**: It is crucial for vehicle owners to familiarize themselves with their state-specific laws regarding auxiliary lights, including mounting height, color, intensity, and usage conditions. Non-compliance can lead to traffic citations.\n\nIn summary, while parking lights and auxiliary fog lights can enhance visibility, their use is regulated to ensure safety on the road. Always consult local laws to ensure compliance.
