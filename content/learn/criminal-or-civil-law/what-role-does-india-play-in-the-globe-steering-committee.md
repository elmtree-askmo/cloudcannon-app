    What role does India play in the GlobE Steering Committee?
answer: >-
    India plays a significant role in the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Steering Committee, having been elected as a member during a plenary session held in Beijing on September 26, 2024. This election followed a multi-stage voting process and positions India among 15 members of the committee, which includes one chair and one vice-chair.\n\nAs a member of the GlobE Steering Committee, India is expected to contribute its expertise in combating corruption and asset recovery, which is seen as a valuable asset to the network. The GlobE Network, launched in 2021 under the G20 framework, aims to facilitate international cooperation in addressing cross-border financial crimes and corruption. It currently comprises 121 member countries and 219 authorities.\n\nIndia's participation in the GlobE Network is particularly important as it strengthens the country's efforts to combat corruption on a global scale. The network serves as a platform for collaboration among nations to enhance anti-corruption measures and improve asset recovery processes, thereby promoting integrity and accountability in governance worldwide.
