answer: >-
    The Indian Parliament possesses a wide array of powers that can be categorized into several key functions:\n\n1. **Legislative Powers**: The primary function of Parliament is to make laws. It can legislate on subjects listed in the Union List and Concurrent List of the Constitution. The Parliament can also amend existing laws and repeal them as necessary.\n\n2. **Constitutional Amendment Powers**: The Parliament has the authority to amend the Constitution, which includes the addition, variation, or repeal of any provision, subject to the Doctrine of Basic Structure. This power is crucial for adapting the Constitution to changing circumstances.\n\n3. **Executive Powers**: Parliament exercises oversight over the executive branch of government. It can question the government, demand accountability, and ensure that the executive operates within the constitutional framework.\n\n4. **Financial Powers**: The Parliament has exclusive rights to approve government expenditure and taxation. The Budget must be presented to Parliament, and no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without its approval.\n\n5. **Judicial Powers**: Parliament has the authority to impeach the President and other high officials, including judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, for violation of the Constitution.\n\n6. **Electoral Powers**: The Parliament plays a role in the election of the President and Vice-President of India, as well as in the establishment of the Election Commission.\n\n7. **Powers to Create New States**: Parliament has the authority to create new states and alter the boundaries of existing states, as per the provisions laid out in the Constitution.\n\n8. **Special Powers of Rajya Sabha**: The Rajya Sabha has exclusive powers, such as the ability to authorize Parliament to legislate on matters in the State List under certain conditions (Article 249) and to create new All India Services.\n\n9. **Control Over State Legislation**: In situations like President's Rule (Article 356), Parliament can legislate on matters within the State List for that particular state, thereby exercising control over state governance.\n\n10. **Ventilation of Public Grievances**: Parliament serves as a platform for discussing public grievances and national issues, allowing for the ventilation of concerns from the populace.\n\nThese powers collectively enable the Indian Parliament to function effectively as the supreme legislative body, ensuring a balance of power within the federal structure of governance in India.
