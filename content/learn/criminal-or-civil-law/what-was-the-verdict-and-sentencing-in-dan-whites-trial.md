    What was the verdict and sentencing in Dan White's trial?
answer: >-
    In the trial of Dan White, the jury reached a verdict after 36 hours of deliberation, finding him not guilty of the murder charges but guilty of two counts of voluntary manslaughter. As a result of this verdict, Dan White was sentenced to a maximum term of 7 years and 8 months for the killings of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. The verdict and sentencing sparked significant outrage and protests, particularly in the Castro district, where demonstrators chanted, "Avenge Harvey Milk!" \n\nWhite's defense during the trial included the controversial "Twinkie defense," which suggested that his consumption of sugary snacks, including Twinkies, contributed to a diminished capacity for understanding his actions at the time of the murders. This defense became widely discussed and criticized in the media and public discourse.\n\nAfter serving his sentence, Dan White was paroled in January 1984. The trial and its aftermath had a lasting impact on the LGBTQ+ community and the political landscape in San Francisco, contributing to the rise of the gay rights movement and shaping public perceptions of justice and equality.
