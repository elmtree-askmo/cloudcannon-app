    What are the key provisions of the Special Protection Group (SPG) Act?
answer: >-
    The Special Protection Group (SPG) Act, enacted in 1988, establishes the framework for the protection of the Prime Minister of India, former Prime Ministers, and their immediate family members. Here are the key provisions of the SPG Act:\n\n1. **Establishment of the SPG**: The Act provides for the constitution and regulation of an armed force of the Union known as the Special Protection Group. This force is specifically tasked with providing proximate security to the Prime Minister and their immediate family members residing with them.\n\n2. **Definition of Proximate Security**: The Act defines "proximate security" as the provision of close protection to the Prime Minister during travel by various means, including rail, road, watercraft, aircraft, or on foot.\n\n3. **Scope of Protection**: The SPG is responsible for protecting the Prime Minister at all times, both within India and abroad. It also extends protection to former Prime Ministers and their immediate family members for a specified duration, typically up to ten years after leaving office.\n\n4. **Amendments**: The SPG Act has undergone amendments, notably in 1991 and 1994, to enhance the scope of protection following significant events, such as the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\n5. **Operational Authority**: The SPG operates under the Cabinet Secretariat and is governed by rules set forth by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The force is composed of personnel drawn from various central and state security agencies, ensuring a robust security framework.\n\n6. **Elite Force Composition**: The SPG is considered an elite security force, with a strength of approximately 3,000 personnel, trained to handle high-risk security situations.\n\nThese provisions collectively ensure that the highest levels of security are maintained for the Prime Minister and their family, reflecting the importance of safeguarding national leadership in India.
