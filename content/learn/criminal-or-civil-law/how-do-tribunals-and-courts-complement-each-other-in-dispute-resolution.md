    How do tribunals and courts complement each other in dispute resolution?
answer: >-
    Tribunals and courts play complementary roles in the dispute resolution landscape, each serving distinct functions while also overlapping in certain areas. Hereâ€™s how they work together:\n\n1. **Specialization vs. General Jurisdiction**: \n   - **Tribunals** are often specialized bodies established to handle specific types of disputes, such as labor disputes, tax issues, or administrative matters. They are designed to provide expertise and efficiency in resolving cases within their designated areas. For example, a labor tribunal may focus solely on employment-related disputes, allowing for quicker and more informed decisions.\n   - **Courts**, on the other hand, have a broader jurisdiction and handle a wide range of cases, including criminal, civil, and administrative matters. They are formal judicial institutions where judges interpret and apply the law across various legal issues.\n\n2. **Procedural Flexibility**: \n   - Tribunals typically adopt less formal procedures and flexible rules, which can expedite the resolution process. This is particularly beneficial in cases where the parties seek a quicker resolution without the complexities often associated with court proceedings.\n   - Courts, while adhering to established legal procedures and rules of evidence, provide a more structured environment for dispute resolution, ensuring that all parties receive a fair trial and legal representation.\n\n3. **Expertise and Accessibility**: \n   - Members of tribunals, known as tribunalists, are often appointed based on their expertise in the relevant subject matter. This specialized knowledge can lead to more informed decisions in complex cases.\n   - Courts may involve judges with varying levels of expertise depending on the case type, but they are generally equipped to handle a wider array of legal issues, making them essential for comprehensive legal adjudication.\n\n4. **Complementary Functions**: \n   - In some legal systems, cases may begin in a tribunal and, if necessary, be escalated to a court for further adjudication. This allows for a tiered approach to dispute resolution, where initial disputes can be resolved quickly in a tribunal, while more complex or contentious issues can be addressed in a court.\n   - Additionally, courts may review decisions made by tribunals to ensure they comply with legal standards and principles, providing a check on the tribunal's authority.\n\n5. **Role in Legal Development**: \n   - Both tribunals and courts contribute to the development of law. Tribunals can help clarify specific legal areas through their decisions, while courts often set broader legal precedents that influence future cases across various jurisdictions.\n\nIn summary, tribunals and courts complement each other by providing specialized and general dispute resolution mechanisms, respectively. Their distinct roles enhance the overall effectiveness of the legal system, ensuring that disputes are resolved efficiently and justly.
