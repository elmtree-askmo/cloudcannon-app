    What evidence is required to prove discrimination under the ADA?
answer: >-
    To prove discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an employee must establish a "prima facie" case, which generally involves demonstrating the following elements:\n\n1. **Disability Status**: The employee must show that they are a person with a disability as defined by the ADA. This includes having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\n\n2. **Qualification for the Position**: The employee must demonstrate that they are qualified for the job in question. This means they can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.\n\n3. **Adverse Employment Action**: The employee must provide evidence that they suffered an adverse employment action (such as being fired, demoted, or denied a promotion) because of their disability. This could include direct evidence of discrimination or circumstantial evidence that suggests a discriminatory motive.\n\n4. **Failure to Accommodate**: If the claim is based on the employer's failure to provide reasonable accommodation, the employee must show that they requested an accommodation and that the employer did not provide it, despite the accommodation being reasonable and not causing undue hardship to the employer.\n\n### Types of Evidence to Gather\nTo support these claims, the following types of evidence may be useful:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: This includes any statements or actions by the employer that explicitly indicate discrimination based on disability.\n  \n- **Indirect Evidence**: This can include patterns of behavior, such as a history of discrimination against employees with disabilities or statistical evidence showing a disparity in treatment.\n\n- **Documentation**: Emails, performance reviews, medical records, and any correspondence related to accommodation requests can serve as critical evidence.\n\n- **Witness Testimony**: Statements from coworkers or supervisors who can corroborate the employee's claims of discrimination or the failure to accommodate.\n\n### Legal Standards\nDifferent courts may apply varying standards to determine whether a prima facie case has been established, so it is advisable for individuals to consult with an experienced employment lawyer who understands the local legal standards.\n\nIn summary, proving discrimination under the ADA requires a combination of demonstrating disability status, qualification for the job, evidence of adverse action, and, if applicable, a failure to provide reasonable accommodation. Gathering comprehensive evidence is crucial to substantiate these claims effectively.
