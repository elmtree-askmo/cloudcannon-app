    How do courts typically interpret standard form contracts?
answer: >-
    Courts typically interpret standard form contracts with a focus on ensuring fairness and protecting the interests of the weaker party, often referred to as the "adhesion" party. This approach is particularly relevant in cases where the contract is presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, which is common in many consumer transactions.\n\nIn the landmark case of *Ledcor v. Northbridge* (2016), the Supreme Court of Canada established that the interpretation of standard form contracts is generally treated as a question of law rather than a question of mixed fact and law. This distinction is significant because it means that courts apply a correctness standard of review, rather than a deferential one, when interpreting these contracts. This is crucial as the implications of such interpretations can extend beyond the immediate parties involved, affecting broader consumer rights and expectations.\n\nWhen interpreting standard form contracts, courts often consider the doctrine of reasonable expectations, which takes into account the reasonable expectations of the weaker party regarding the terms and conditions of the contract. If there are ambiguities in the contract language, these are typically construed against the drafter, following the principle of *contra proferentem*. This principle ensures that any unclear terms are interpreted in a manner that favors the party that did not draft the contract.\n\nAdditionally, courts may assess whether the terms of the contract are written in clear and unambiguous language. If a contract contains provisions that are deemed unconscionable or contrary to public policy, it may be rendered unenforceable. The courts also consider whether the terms are understandable to a reasonably intelligent consumer, especially when dealing with boilerplate terms that may not be apparent to the average person.\n\nOverall, the interpretation of standard form contracts by courts reflects a balance between upholding the contractual agreements made by parties and protecting consumers from potentially unfair or exploitative terms. This evolving legal framework aims to address the challenges posed by standard form contracts in various industries, including e-commerce and insurance.
