    How has India's membership in the GlobE Steering Committee impacted its domestic anti-corruption policies?
answer: >-
    India's recent election to the GlobE Networkâ€™s Steering Committee has significant implications for its domestic anti-corruption policies. The GlobE Network, which is an initiative launched under the G20 framework, aims to address international corruption and financial crime. As a member of the 15-member steering committee, India is positioned to actively contribute to global efforts in combating corruption and facilitating asset recovery.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) represent India within this network, with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) serving as the central authority. This structure allows India to leverage its expertise in anti-corruption measures on an international platform, thereby enhancing its domestic policies through shared knowledge and best practices.\n\nDuring India's G-20 Presidency in 2023, two high-level principles for combating corruption were adopted, which emphasized the importance of leveraging the GlobE Network. This indicates a commitment to not only improve domestic anti-corruption frameworks but also to align them with international standards and practices.\n\nFurthermore, India's participation in the GlobE Steering Committee is expected to strengthen its investigative capabilities and provide leadership in combating corruption across the country. The CBI, as the premier investigative agency, will benefit from the collaborative efforts and resources available through the GlobE Network, potentially leading to more effective enforcement of anti-corruption laws domestically.\n\nIn summary, India's membership in the GlobE Steering Committee is likely to enhance its domestic anti-corruption policies by fostering international cooperation, sharing expertise, and aligning its practices with global standards in the fight against corruption.
