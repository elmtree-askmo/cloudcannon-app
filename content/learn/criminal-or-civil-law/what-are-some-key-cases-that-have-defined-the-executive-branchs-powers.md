    What are some key cases that have defined the executive branch’s powers?
answer: >-
    Several key Supreme Court cases have significantly defined the powers of the executive branch in the United States. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)**: This case is a landmark decision where the Supreme Court ruled against President Harry Truman's attempt to seize steel mills during the Korean War. The Court emphasized the need for Congressional authorization, reinforcing the principle of separation of powers. Justice Jackson's opinion in this case has been cited in numerous subsequent cases regarding executive authority.\n\n2. **United States v. Nixon (1974)**: This case arose from the Watergate scandal, where the Supreme Court held that President Nixon was not above the law and had to comply with a subpoena for tape recordings. The ruling clarified the scope and limitations of presidential power, reinforcing the strength of the judicial system and demonstrating that constitutional principles would be upheld even under political pressure.\n\n3. **Clinton v. City of New York (1998)**: In this case, the Supreme Court invalidated the Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the President to unilaterally cancel specific provisions of bills. The Court ruled that this action violated the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which requires that legislation be passed in its entirety by both houses of Congress.\n\n4. **Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935)**: This case addressed the limits of presidential power over independent regulatory agencies. The Supreme Court ruled that the President could not remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, establishing that certain agencies operate independently of presidential control.\n\n5. **Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010)**: The Supreme Court ruled that the structure of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board violated the separation of powers by limiting the President's ability to remove board members. This case further clarified the extent of executive power in relation to independent agencies.\n\nThese cases collectively illustrate the ongoing tension and balance between the powers of the executive branch and the legislative and judicial branches, shaping the understanding of executive authority in the United States.
