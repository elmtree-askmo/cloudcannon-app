    What was the Supreme Court's rationale in its decision on electoral bonds?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgment on February 15, 2024, striking down the Electoral Bonds Scheme (EBS) as unconstitutional. The court's rationale centered on several key points that emphasized the importance of transparency in political funding and the fundamental rights of voters.\n\n1. **Violation of the Right to Information**: The Supreme Court asserted that the EBS disproportionately restricted the fundamental right of voters to access information about the sources of funds received by political parties. This right is essential for voters to make informed decisions during elections. The court emphasized that the purpose of the electoral bonds—allegedly to combat black money—could not justify infringing upon this right.\n\n2. **Constitutional Reasonableness**: The court examined whether the restrictions imposed by the EBS on citizens' right to information were constitutionally reasonable. It concluded that the scheme's limitations were not justified, as the ostensible goals of the scheme could be achieved through less restrictive means.\n\n3. **Anonymity and Selectivity**: The court criticized the scheme for providing selective anonymity, which undermined the principle of equality in political financing. It highlighted that while the scheme was intended to protect donor privacy, it ultimately favored certain political parties, particularly the ruling party, by obscuring the flow of funds.\n\n4. **Impact on Democracy**: The judgment underscored the significance of transparency in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process. The court noted that voters associate their choices with political parties, and thus, understanding the financial backing of these parties is crucial for a functioning democracy.\n\n5. **Immediate Actions Ordered**: Following the ruling, the Supreme Court mandated the State Bank of India (SBI) to cease issuing electoral bonds immediately and to disclose all past bond transactions, including details of donors and recipient parties, to the Election Commission of India by March 31, 2024.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Electoral Bonds Scheme was rooted in the need to uphold constitutional rights, particularly the right to information, and to ensure transparency and accountability in political funding, which are vital for the health of democracy in India.
