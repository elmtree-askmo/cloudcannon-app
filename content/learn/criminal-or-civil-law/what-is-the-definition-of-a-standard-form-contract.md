    What is the definition of a standard form contract?
answer: >-
    A standard form contract, also known as a boilerplate contract or adhesion contract, is a pre-drafted agreement that employs standardized, non-negotiated provisions. These contracts are typically presented on a "take it or leave it" basis, meaning that one party has little to no opportunity to negotiate the terms. They are commonly used in situations where the terms and conditions are largely uniform across multiple transactions, such as insurance agreements, service contracts, and consumer purchases.\n\nStandard form contracts are characterized by their preprinted nature, containing set clauses that are often drafted by one party, usually the stronger party in the transaction. This results in an imbalance of bargaining power, as the other party must accept the terms as they are presented. The use of such contracts can streamline transactions and reduce negotiation costs, but they may also lead to concerns about fairness and the potential for exploitation of the weaker party.\n\nIn summary, a standard form contract is a legal agreement that simplifies the contracting process by using a uniform template, but it often limits the ability of one party to negotiate the terms.
