    What is the statute of limitations for securities violations under the Securities Act of 1933?
answer: >-
    The statute of limitations for securities violations under the Securities Act of 1933 is defined in Section 13 of the Act. It stipulates that claims must be brought within one year of the discovery of the violation or within three years after the security involved was first offered to the public. \n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the three-year time limit is considered a statute of repose, which means it is not subject to equitable tolling. This was affirmed in a 2017 decision where the Court clarified that the American Pipe tolling rule, which allows for the extension of statutes of limitations under certain circumstances, does not apply to statutes of repose like the one in the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nFor securities fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the statute of limitations is different, consisting of a two-year period from the discovery of the fraud and a five-year period from when the fraud occurred. \n\nIn summary, for the Securities Act of 1933, the relevant time frames are:\n- One year from discovery of the violation.\n- Three years from the initial public offering of the security.
