    How does the agreement address severability and counterparts?
answer: >-
    The Managed Service Provider (MSP) Addendum addresses severability and counterparts in the following manner:\n\n1. **Severability**: While the gathered information does not explicitly mention the severability clause, it is a common legal principle in contracts. Typically, a severability clause ensures that if any provision of the agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to be in effect. This protects the integrity of the agreement as a whole.\n\n2. **Counterparts**: The agreement specifies that any written MSP Partner Order may be executed in counterparts. This means that each counterpart is considered an original document, but together they constitute one and the same agreement. This provision allows the parties to sign separate copies of the agreement, which can be particularly useful in situations where the parties are in different locations.\n\nIn summary, while the specific details regarding severability are not provided in the gathered information, the counterparts clause clearly facilitates the execution of the agreement by allowing multiple signed copies to be treated as a single document.
