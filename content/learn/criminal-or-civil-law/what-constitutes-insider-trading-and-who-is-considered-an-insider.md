    What constitutes insider trading and who is considered an insider?
answer: >-
    Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of stocks and other securities based on material, non-public information about a company. This practice is considered illegal when the information used for trading is still non-public and can significantly influence an investor's decision to buy or sell the security. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines illegal insider trading as trading that occurs when an individual possesses material non-public information and violates a duty to keep that information confidential.\n\n### What Constitutes Insider Trading?\nInsider trading is characterized by the following elements:\n- **Material Information**: This is any information that could substantially impact an investor's decision regarding the purchase or sale of a security. For example, if a company is about to announce a significant product recall, this information could influence stock prices.\n- **Non-Public Information**: The information must not be available to the general public. If the information has been publicly disclosed, trading based on it is legal.\n- **Fiduciary Duty**: Insider trading typically involves a breach of fiduciary duty, where an insider (such as a company executive) uses confidential information for personal gain.\n\n### Who is Considered an Insider?\nAn "insider" is generally defined as:\n- **Company Executives and Directors**: Individuals who hold significant positions within a company, such as CEOs, CFOs, and board members, are considered insiders due to their access to confidential information.\n- **Large Shareholders**: Individuals or entities that own a significant percentage (typically 10% or more) of a company's shares are also classified as insiders.\n- **Employees**: Employees who have access to non-public information about the company, such as research scientists or financial analysts, are considered insiders.\n- **Tippees**: Individuals who receive insider information from an insider (known as "tippees") can also be held liable for insider trading if they trade based on that information and are aware that the information was disclosed in violation of a fiduciary duty.\n\n### Legal vs. Illegal Insider Trading\nLegal insider trading occurs when insiders buy or sell shares of their own company while adhering to specific regulations, such as reporting their trades to the SEC. Conversely, illegal insider trading can lead to severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as it undermines investor confidence and the integrity of the financial markets.\n\nIn summary, insider trading involves trading based on confidential information that is not available to the public, and those who have access to such information, including company executives, large shareholders, and employees, are considered insiders.
