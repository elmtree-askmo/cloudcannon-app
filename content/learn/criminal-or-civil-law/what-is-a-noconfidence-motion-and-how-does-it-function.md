    What is a no-confidence motion and how does it function?
answer: >-
    A no-confidence motion is a parliamentary procedure in India that allows members of the Lok Sabha to express their lack of confidence in the government. This motion is significant as it serves as a mechanism for the opposition to challenge the ruling government's authority and mandate.\n\n### Functioning of a No-Confidence Motion:\n\n1. **Initiation**: Any member of the Lok Sabha can move a no-confidence motion, but it must be supported by at least 50 other members. The motion must be in writing, signed by the member who is moving it, and submitted to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha on a sitting day.\n\n2. **Acceptance**: The Speaker of the Lok Sabha will review the motion. If it meets the necessary criteria, the Speaker will admit it, and a date for a debate will be announced, typically within 10 days.\n\n3. **Debate**: The motion is then debated in the Lok Sabha. The member who submitted the motion will present the reasons for the lack of confidence, and the government will have the opportunity to respond.\n\n4. **Voting**: Following the debate, a vote is conducted. If the no-confidence motion receives a majority of votes in favor, the government is deemed to have lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha and is required to resign. This can lead to the formation of a new government or the calling of fresh elections.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Since the first no-confidence motion was moved in 1963, there have been a total of 27 no-confidence motions in India. The government of Indira Gandhi faced the maximum number of such motions.\n\n### Importance:\nNo-confidence motions are crucial political events that reflect the opposition's ability to unite against the ruling party and can significantly impact the political landscape of the country. They are a vital aspect of the parliamentary system, ensuring that the government remains accountable to the elected representatives of the people.\n\nIn summary, a no-confidence motion is a powerful tool within the parliamentary framework of India, allowing for the assessment of the government's legitimacy and effectiveness.
