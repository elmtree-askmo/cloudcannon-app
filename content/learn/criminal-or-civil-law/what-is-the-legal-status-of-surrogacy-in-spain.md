    What is the legal status of surrogacy in Spain?
answer: >-
    In Spain, the legal status of surrogacy is quite clear: it is prohibited. According to Article 10 of Law 14/2006, which regulates Assisted Human Reproduction Techniques, any surrogacy contract—whether paid or unpaid—is considered null and void. This means that such agreements have no legal effect within the country. The Spanish Supreme Court has reinforced this stance, ruling that surrogacy contracts violate the fundamental rights of both the surrogate mother and the child, as they can lead to exploitation and damage to the best interests of the minor.\n\nFurthermore, all forms of surrogacy, including altruistic surrogacy where no financial compensation is involved, are illegal in Spain. This prohibition contrasts with the legal frameworks in some other countries where surrogacy is permitted and regulated. \n\nWhile individuals may seek surrogacy arrangements in countries where it is legal, the resulting parental rights and registration of children born through such arrangements can be complex when they return to Spain. The Spanish Civil Registry allows for the registration of children born abroad via surrogacy under specific conditions, but the underlying surrogacy agreement remains invalid in Spain.\n\nOverall, the legal landscape surrounding surrogacy in Spain is characterized by a strong prohibition against the practice, reflecting concerns about the ethical implications and potential exploitation involved.
