    How does the right of lien benefit an unpaid seller?
answer: >-
    The right of lien is a significant benefit for an unpaid seller as it provides a legal mechanism to retain possession of goods until the buyer fulfills their payment obligations. This right is particularly crucial in safeguarding the seller against potential losses when a buyer defaults on payment.\n\n1. **Possessory Right**: The right of lien allows the unpaid seller to keep the goods in their possession, effectively preventing the buyer from taking ownership of the goods until the full price is paid. This possessory right is essential because it gives the seller leverage in negotiations and ensures that they have a form of security against non-payment.\n\n2. **Indivisibility**: The right of lien is indivisible, meaning that the seller cannot be compelled to accept partial payment for a portion of the goods. The buyer must pay the full price to regain possession of the entire lot, which further protects the seller's interests.\n\n3. **Applicability**: An unpaid seller can exercise this right even if they are acting as an agent or bailee for the goods. This flexibility allows sellers to maintain control over the goods in various commercial arrangements.\n\n4. **Protection Against Default**: The right of lien is part of a broader set of rights granted to unpaid sellers under the Sale of Goods Act, which includes the right of stoppage in transit and the right of resale. These rights collectively provide sellers with effective remedies to recover their goods or seek compensation in case of buyer default.\n\n5. **Termination of Lien**: It is important to note that the right of lien can be terminated under certain conditions, such as when the seller has made a part delivery of the goods under circumstances that indicate an agreement to waive the lien. However, as long as the lien is in effect, it serves as a powerful tool for the seller.\n\nIn summary, the right of lien benefits an unpaid seller by providing a strong legal basis to retain possession of goods until payment is made, thereby reducing the risk of financial loss due to buyer default. This right is a critical component of the legal framework governing commercial transactions, ensuring fairness and protection for sellers.
