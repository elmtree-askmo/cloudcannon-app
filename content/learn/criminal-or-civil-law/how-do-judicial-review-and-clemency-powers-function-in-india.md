    How do judicial review and clemency powers function in India?
answer: >-
    In India, judicial review and clemency powers are significant components of the constitutional framework, ensuring checks and balances within the government.\n\n### Judicial Review\n\nJudicial review in India is the process by which the Supreme Court and High Courts examine the constitutionality of legislative and executive actions. Although the term "judicial review" is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it is implicitly provided for through various articles, including Articles 13, 32, 136, and 142. The primary purpose of judicial review is to ensure that laws and actions conform to the Constitution, thereby protecting individual rights and maintaining the rule of law.\n\nThe Supreme Court has established that judicial review can be applied to the clemency powers exercised by the President and Governors under Articles 72 and 161, respectively. The grounds for judicial review in this context include:\n\n1. **Lack of Application of Mind**: The order must reflect a thoughtful consideration of the circumstances.\n2. **Mala Fide Intentions**: The clemency power should not be exercised with malicious intent.\n\nLandmark cases, such as *Maru Ram v. Union of India* (1981) and *Shatrughan Chauhan v. Union of India* (2014), have reinforced the need for just and timely decisions, particularly in death penalty cases, to prevent undue mental distress for convicts.\n\n### Clemency Powers\n\nClemency powers in India are conferred upon the President under Article 72 and upon Governors under Article 161 of the Constitution. These powers allow the executive to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment. The clemency power is intended to ensure justice, equity, and compassion, particularly in cases where the judicial process may have overlooked mitigating circumstances.\n\nWhile the clemency powers are generally immune from judicial review, they can be challenged if exercised arbitrarily or without proper consideration. The Supreme Court has emphasized that these powers should be exercised cautiously and in appropriate cases, ensuring that they do not completely erase the conviction but rather mitigate the sentence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, judicial review serves as a critical mechanism to oversee the exercise of clemency powers in India, ensuring that such powers are not misused and that justice is served. The interplay between these two functions reflects the broader principles of accountability and fairness embedded in the Indian Constitution.
