    To apply for a driver license in Tennessee, you must meet several specific requirements. Here are the key criteria:\n\n1. **Age Requirements**: \n   - You must be at least 15 years old to apply for a learner's permit.\n   - For a full, unrestricted driver license, you must be at least 18 years old, although there are graduated licensing options for younger drivers.\n\n2. **Proof of Residency**: \n   - You need to provide documentation that proves your residency in Tennessee.\n\n3. **Legal Presence and Identification**: \n   - You must present documents that verify your legal presence in the U.S. This includes being a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.\n\n4. **Application Process**: \n   - You must apply in person at a Tennessee Department of Safety (DOS) office. \n   - You can begin your application online, but you will need to visit a driver service center to complete the process.\n\n5. **Testing Requirements**: \n   - Applicants must pass a vision screening, a knowledge test, and a driving exam.\n\n6. **Documentation**: \n   - Bring the necessary documents, which may include proof of identity, residency, and any other required paperwork.\n\n7. **Fees**: \n   - You will need to pay the required fee for the license.\n\n8. **New Residents**: \n   - If you are a new resident or returning to Tennessee with a valid out-of-state driver license, you must obtain a Tennessee driver license within 30 days of establishing residency. You will need to surrender your out-of-state license.\n\nBy ensuring you meet these requirements and following the application process, you can successfully obtain a driver license in Tennessee.
