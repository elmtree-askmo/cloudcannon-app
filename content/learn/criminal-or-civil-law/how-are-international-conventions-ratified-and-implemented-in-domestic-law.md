    How are international conventions ratified and implemented in domestic law?
answer: >-
    International conventions are agreements between countries that establish legal obligations and standards. The process of ratifying and implementing these conventions in domestic law can vary depending on the legal system of a country. In the context of Singapore and many other jurisdictions that follow a dualist system, the following steps are typically involved:\n\n1. **Ratification**: After negotiations and signing, a country must ratify an international convention for it to have legal effect. Ratification is a formal act by which a state indicates its consent to be bound by the terms of the convention. In Singapore, this process involves the President's approval, often following a recommendation from the Cabinet.\n\n2. **Legislative Incorporation**: In a dualist system, international treaties do not automatically become part of domestic law upon ratification. Instead, the legislature must pass a statute that incorporates the treaty into national law. This requirement underscores the principle that international law and domestic law are separate entities. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court in the Miller case emphasized that treaties cannot alter domestic law unless explicitly enacted by Parliament.\n\n3. **Judicial Interpretation**: Courts play a crucial role in interpreting the relationship between international and domestic law. They may be called upon to determine whether a treaty has been properly incorporated into domestic law and how it should be applied in specific cases. This judicial interpretation ensures that the provisions of the international convention are effectively integrated into the legal framework of the country.\n\n4. **Implementation**: Once a convention is incorporated into domestic law, it may require additional legislative measures to ensure compliance with its provisions. This can involve enacting new laws or amending existing ones to align with the obligations set forth in the convention.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Many international conventions require states to report on their implementation and compliance. This process often involves periodic reviews and assessments by international bodies, which can influence domestic policy and law.\n\nIn summary, the ratification and implementation of international conventions in domestic law involve a structured process that includes ratification, legislative incorporation, judicial interpretation, and ongoing compliance monitoring. This process ensures that international obligations are recognized and enforced within the national legal system, while also maintaining the sovereignty of the state.
