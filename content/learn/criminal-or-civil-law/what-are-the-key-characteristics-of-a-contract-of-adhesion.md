    What are the key characteristics of a contract of adhesion?
answer: >-
    A contract of adhesion is characterized by several key features that distinguish it from other types of contracts. Here are the primary characteristics:\n\n1. **Standardized Terms**: Adhesion contracts are typically pre-drafted and contain standardized terms and conditions. The party that creates the contract, often a business or institution, does so without input from the other party, who usually has little choice but to accept the terms as they are presented.\n\n2. **Unequal Bargaining Power**: These contracts are usually created by a party with significantly more bargaining power, such as a large corporation, leaving the other party, often a consumer or employee, in a position where they must "take it or leave it." This imbalance means that the weaker party has limited ability to negotiate the terms.\n\n3. **Non-Negotiable**: The terms of an adhesion contract are generally non-negotiable. The weaker party is presented with the contract as a complete package and must accept it in its entirety or forgo the opportunity to engage in the transaction.\n\n4. **Common Usage**: Adhesion contracts are prevalent in various contexts, including consumer agreements, employment contracts, and service agreements. Examples include End User License Agreements (EULAs), liability waivers, and terms of service for online platforms.\n\n5. **Legal Considerations**: Courts often scrutinize adhesion contracts for fairness, particularly if the terms are deemed unconscionable or if the weaker party was not given a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms. Legal mechanisms may be employed to ensure fairness, and courts may interpret ambiguous terms in favor of the weaker party.\n\n6. **Take-It-or-Leave-It Basis**: The essence of an adhesion contract is that it is offered on a "take it or leave it" basis, meaning the weaker party must accept the contract as is or seek alternatives, which may not be feasible.\n\nThese characteristics highlight the nature of contracts of adhesion and the implications they have for the parties involved, particularly regarding fairness and enforceability in legal contexts.
