    What is the role of the Supreme Court in Singapore's judiciary system?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of Singapore serves as the highest court in the country's judiciary system, playing a pivotal role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice. Its primary functions and responsibilities include:\n\n1. **Judicial Authority**: The Supreme Court is endowed with judicial power as specified in Article 93 of the Constitution of Singapore. This power enables the court to interpret and apply the law, adjudicate disputes, and ensure that justice is served. The decisions made by the Supreme Court are binding on all lower courts, establishing legal precedents that guide future cases.\n\n2. **Court Structure**: The Supreme Court is divided into two main divisions:\n   - **Court of Appeal**: This division hears appeals from the High Court and other lower courts. It is the final appellate court in Singapore, meaning its decisions are conclusive and cannot be appealed further.\n   - **High Court**: The High Court has original jurisdiction over serious criminal and civil cases, as well as appellate jurisdiction over decisions made by subordinate courts, such as District Courts and Magistrates' Courts.\n\n3. **Judicial Review**: The Supreme Court also has the authority to conduct judicial reviews, which allows it to assess the actions of the executive and legislative branches to ensure compliance with the Constitution. This power is crucial for protecting individual rights and maintaining the integrity of the legal system.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court of Singapore is a cornerstone of the judicial power structure, with extensive authority to interpret laws, adjudicate disputes, and ensure justice, thereby upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of citizens.
