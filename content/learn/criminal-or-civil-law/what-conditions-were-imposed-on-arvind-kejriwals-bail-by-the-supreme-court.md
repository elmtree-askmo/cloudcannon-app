    What conditions were imposed on Arvind Kejriwal's bail by the Supreme Court?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court of India granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection with an alleged money laundering case linked to the liquor policy. The bail was granted under specific conditions, which include:\n\n1. **Prohibition from Visiting Certain Locations**: Arvind Kejriwal is barred from entering the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and the Delhi Secretariat.\n2. **Restrictions on Signing Documents**: He is not allowed to sign any files during the period of his bail.\n3. **Bail Bond Requirement**: A bail bond of Rs 50,000 was mandated for his release.\n\nThese conditions were set to ensure that Kejriwal does not interfere with the ongoing investigation related to the case. The Supreme Court's decision came after noting that he had already suffered incarceration for 90 days prior to the bail being granted. The court's ruling reflects a balance between the rights of the accused and the integrity of the judicial process.
