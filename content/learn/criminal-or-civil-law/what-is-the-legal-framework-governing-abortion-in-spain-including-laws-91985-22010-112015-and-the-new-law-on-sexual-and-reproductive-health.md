    What is the legal framework governing abortion in Spain, including Laws 9/1985, 2/2010, 11/2015, and the new law on sexual and reproductive health?
answer: >-
    The legal framework governing abortion in Spain has evolved significantly over the years, primarily through several key laws: Law 9/1985, Law 2/2010, Law 11/2015, and the recent reforms in sexual and reproductive health.\n\n1. **Law 9/1985**: This was the first legal instrument to regulate abortion in Spain, allowing for the decriminalization of abortion under specific circumstances, namely ethical, eugenic, and therapeutic grounds. It established a medical indication model, which meant that abortion was only permissible in certain situations.\n\n2. **Law 2/2010**: This law marked a radical shift in the regulation of abortion in Spain. It allowed women to access legal abortion within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy without needing to provide justification. Additionally, it permitted abortion up to 22 weeks in cases where there are risks to maternal health or fetal malformation. This law aimed to enhance women's reproductive rights and moved away from the restrictive framework of the previous law.\n\n3. **Law 11/2015**: This law was enacted to reinforce protections for minors and women with judicially modified capacity regarding voluntary interruption of pregnancy. It included provisions for informed consent, particularly focusing on the rights of underage women seeking abortions.\n\n4. **Recent Reforms on Sexual and Reproductive Health**: In 2023, Spain introduced a new law that further expands reproductive rights. This legislation allows girls aged 16 and 17 to access abortion services without parental consent, making Spain the first European country to implement such a provision. The law also includes measures for paid menstrual leave and the free distribution of emergency contraceptives, reflecting a broader commitment to sexual and reproductive health rights.\n\nOverall, the legal framework surrounding abortion in Spain has transitioned from a restrictive model to one that emphasizes women's autonomy and reproductive rights, aligning with contemporary views on sexual and reproductive health.
