    How did the Employment Division v. Smith case affect the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court case Employment Division v. Smith, decided in 1990, significantly altered the interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Prior to this ruling, the Court had employed a "compelling interest" test, which required the government to demonstrate a compelling reason for any law that substantially burdened religious practices. However, in Smith, the Court ruled that generally applicable laws that do not specifically target religious practices do not violate the Free Exercise Clause, even if they have a disparate impact on religious adherents.\n\nThe case involved two Native American men who were denied unemployment benefits after being fired for using peyote, a substance prohibited under Oregon law. The Court's decision effectively stated that the Free Exercise Clause does not provide a claim against neutral laws of general applicability, thereby eliminating the requirement for the government to show a compelling interest in cases involving religious practices.\n\nThis ruling has been described as "gutting" the Free Exercise Clause, as it replaced the previous standard with a more lenient approach that allows the government to enforce laws that may inadvertently affect religious practices, as long as those laws are neutral and generally applicable. Consequently, the decision has led to ongoing debates about the balance between religious freedoms and government regulations, and it has prompted discussions about the need for legislative responses, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which aimed to restore some protections for religious exercise.\n\nIn summary, Employment Division v. Smith marked a pivotal shift in the legal landscape regarding religious freedom, moving away from a protective framework for religious practices to a more permissive standard that prioritizes the enforcement of neutral laws over individual religious rights.
