    What are some examples of protective devices used in contracts?
answer: >-
    In the context of contract law, protective devices are mechanisms or clauses included in contracts to safeguard the interests of one or both parties, particularly in situations where there is an imbalance of bargaining power. Here are some examples of protective devices used in contracts:\n\n1. **Protective Covenants**: These are agreements where one party provides protection to another, often in the form of insurance or guarantees. For instance, a contractor may agree to insure a project against certain risks.\n\n2. **Anti-Dilution Provisions**: These clauses protect investors from the dilution of their ownership percentage in a company. They ensure that if new shares are issued, existing shareholders have the right to purchase additional shares to maintain their ownership percentage.\n\n3. **Reasonable Notice Requirements**: In standard form contracts, it is often required that the party delivering the contract provides adequate notice of the terms and conditions. This is to ensure that the offeree is aware of their obligations and rights, as seen in cases like Henderson v. Stevenson.\n\n4. **Court-Developed Protections**: Courts have developed various mechanisms to protect individuals in standard form contracts, especially when one party has significantly more bargaining power. These may include the requirement for clear and conspicuous disclosure of terms and the ability to challenge unfair terms.\n\n5. **Termination Clauses**: These clauses allow one or both parties to terminate the contract under specified conditions, providing a safety net if circumstances change or if one party fails to meet their obligations.\n\n6. **Indemnity Clauses**: These clauses require one party to compensate the other for certain damages or losses, providing a layer of financial protection.\n\n7. **Limitation of Liability Clauses**: These clauses limit the amount one party can claim from the other in the event of a breach, thus protecting parties from excessive claims.\n\nThese protective devices are essential in ensuring fairness and equity in contractual relationships, particularly in scenarios involving standard form contracts or contracts of adhesion, where one party may have significantly more power than the other.
