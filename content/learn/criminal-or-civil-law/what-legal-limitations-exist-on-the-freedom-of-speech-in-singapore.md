    What legal limitations exist on the freedom of speech in Singapore?
answer: >-
    In Singapore, the freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to express their opinions freely. However, this right is subject to several legal limitations aimed at maintaining public order, national security, and societal harmony. Here are the key legal limitations on freedom of speech in Singapore:\n\n1. **National Security**: Speech that threatens national security can be restricted. This includes any expression that may incite violence or undermine the stability of the state.\n\n2. **Public Order**: The government can impose restrictions on speech that may lead to public disorder or riots. This is particularly relevant in a multi-ethnic society like Singapore, where speech that incites racial or religious tensions is closely monitored.\n\n3. **Public Health and Morals**: Speech that is deemed to be against public health or morals can also be restricted. This includes hate speech or any form of expression that may promote violence or discrimination against particular groups.\n\n4. **Defamation and Sedition Laws**: Singapore has strict defamation laws that can penalize individuals for making false statements that harm the reputation of others. Additionally, sedition laws can be invoked against speech that promotes hostility between different races or classes.\n\n5. **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act**: This law prohibits speech that may undermine religious harmony in Singapore. It is designed to prevent any expression that could incite religious discord.\n\n6. **Protection from Misinformation**: The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), enacted in 2019, criminalizes the dissemination of false information online. Critics argue that the definition of "false information" is vague and can be used to stifle dissent and free speech.\n\n7. **Regulation of the Media**: The government exercises significant control over the media landscape in Singapore, which includes licensing requirements and content regulations that can limit the scope of free expression in journalism.\n\nIn summary, while Singapore's Constitution provides for freedom of speech, various laws and regulations impose significant limitations to ensure that this freedom does not infringe upon national security, public order, and social harmony. These restrictions reflect the government's approach to maintaining stability in a diverse society, but they have also raised concerns about the potential stifling of dissent and free expression.
