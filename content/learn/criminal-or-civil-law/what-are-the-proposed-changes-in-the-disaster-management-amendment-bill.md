    The Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, 2024, introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 1, 2024, proposes several significant changes to the existing Disaster Management Act of 2005. Here are the key proposed changes:\n\n1. **Strengthening Authorities**: The bill aims to enhance the statutory status of certain pre-existing organizations, such as the National Crisis Management Committee and the High-Level Committee, thereby providing them with clearer roles and responsibilities in disaster management.\n\n2. **Creation of Urban Disaster Management Authorities**: It proposes the establishment of Urban Disaster Management Authorities to address the unique challenges posed by disasters in urban settings.\n\n3. **State Disaster Response Forces**: The bill seeks to create State Disaster Response Forces to improve the response capabilities at the state level during disasters.\n\n4. **Disaster Database**: A significant feature of the bill is the mandate to create a comprehensive disaster database at both national and state levels. This database will include critical information such as disaster assessments, fund allocation details, expenditures, preparedness and mitigation plans, and a risk register, which will enhance data management and analysis.\n\n5. **Clarity and Coordination**: The bill aims to improve clarity and coordination among national and state stakeholders involved in disaster management, ensuring that roles and responsibilities are well-defined.\n\n6. **Integration into Development Plans**: The amendments seek to integrate disaster management more effectively into development plans, aligning with the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission.\n\nThese changes are intended to enhance the overall effectiveness of disaster management in India, ensuring a more coordinated and efficient response to disasters.
