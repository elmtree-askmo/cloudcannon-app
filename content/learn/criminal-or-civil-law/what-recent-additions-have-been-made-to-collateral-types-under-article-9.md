    What recent additions have been made to collateral types under Article 9?
answer: >-
    Recent additions to collateral types under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) primarily include the introduction of controllable electronic records (CERs) and the formal inclusion of health care insurance receivables as original collateral.\n\n1. **Controllable Electronic Records (CERs)**: The 2022 UCC Amendments created a new subcategory under the definition of general intangibles, specifically defining CERs as "information that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form" and that is susceptible to control. This addition reflects the evolving nature of digital assets and provides clarity on how security interests in these records can be attached and perfected. A security interest in a CER can be perfected by registering a financing statement or by exercising control, similar to investment property, which grants priority over other security interests perfected solely by registration.\n\n2. **Health Care Insurance Receivables**: The amendments also explicitly cover health care insurance receivables as original collateral. This is defined as a right to payment of a monetary obligation for health care goods or services provided, thus expanding the types of collateral that can be secured under Article 9.\n\nThese changes aim to enhance the clarity, predictability, and protection for lenders and creditors dealing with digital assets and health care receivables, fostering greater trust in secured transactions involving these types of collateral.
