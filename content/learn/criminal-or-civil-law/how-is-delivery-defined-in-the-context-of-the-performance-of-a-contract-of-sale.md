    How is 'delivery' defined in the context of the performance of a contract of sale?
answer: >-
    In the context of the performance of a contract of sale, 'delivery' is defined under Section 2(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, as the "voluntary transfer of possession of goods from one person to another." This definition emphasizes that for a transfer to be considered a delivery, it must be voluntary, meaning that the party transferring the goods must intend to relinquish possession.\n\nDelivery can take various forms, including:\n\n1. **Actual Delivery**: This occurs when the goods are physically handed over to the buyer or an authorized person. For example, if a seller hands over furniture to the buyer, this is an instance of actual delivery.\n\n2. **Symbolical Delivery**: This type of delivery may occur when the goods are not physically transferred but are represented in a way that signifies the transfer of possession. For instance, handing over the keys to a warehouse where the goods are stored can be considered a symbolical delivery.\n\n3. **Constructive Delivery**: This involves a situation where the goods are not physically moved, but the buyer is given the means to control them, such as through documentation or other means.\n\nThe performance of a contract of sale is fundamentally about the seller delivering the goods and the buyer accepting them while making the corresponding payment. The Sale of Goods Act also stipulates that unless otherwise agreed, the delivery of goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions, meaning both parties must be ready to fulfill their obligations simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, delivery in the context of a sale contract is a critical component that signifies the transfer of possession, which is distinct from the passing of ownership or title of the goods.
