    What were the implications of Harris v McRae and Casey v Planned Parenthood on substantive due process?
answer: >-
    The implications of the Supreme Court cases *Harris v. McRae* (1980) and *Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey* (1992) on substantive due process are significant in the context of reproductive rights and the legal framework surrounding abortion.\n\nIn *Harris v. McRae*, the Court held that states participating in Medicaid are not required to fund medically necessary abortions if federal reimbursement is unavailable due to the Hyde Amendment, which restricts the use of federal funds for abortion services. The Court ruled that this funding restriction did not violate the liberty or equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This decision effectively established that the right to abortion, as recognized in *Roe v. Wade*, does not guarantee the right to public funding for the procedure, thereby framing abortion as a negative right rather than a positive one.\n\nConversely, in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, the Court reaffirmed the central holding of *Roe v. Wade* but introduced the "undue burden" standard for evaluating state regulations on abortion. This standard allows for certain restrictions as long as they do not place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before fetal viability. The *Casey* decision emphasized the importance of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, thus reinforcing the substantive due process protections surrounding reproductive rights.\n\nTogether, these cases illustrate the evolving interpretation of substantive due process in relation to abortion rights. While *Harris v. McRae* limited the scope of the right by denying funding, *Casey* sought to balance state interests with individual rights, ultimately affirming the constitutional protection of a woman's right to choose while allowing for some regulatory measures. This interplay highlights the complexities of substantive due process as it pertains to personal liberties and state interests in the realm of reproductive health.
