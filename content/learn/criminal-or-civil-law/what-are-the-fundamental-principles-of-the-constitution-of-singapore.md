    What are the fundamental principles of the Constitution of Singapore?
answer: >-
    The Constitution of Singapore serves as the supreme law of the Republic and outlines several fundamental principles that govern the structure of the government and the rights of citizens. Here are the key principles enshrined in the Constitution:\n\n1. **Supremacy of the Constitution**: The Constitution is the highest legal authority in Singapore. Any law or government action that contradicts the Constitution is deemed unconstitutional, ensuring that all laws and actions are subject to constitutional review.\n\n2. **Separation of Powers**: The Constitution establishes a clear separation of powers among the three branches of government: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. This principle is crucial for preventing the concentration of power in any single branch and ensures that each branch operates within its designated authority.\n\n3. **Protection of Fundamental Rights**: The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to its citizens, enshrining the rule of law. It provides mechanisms for individuals to challenge government actions that may infringe upon their rights, acting as a safeguard against potential abuses of power.\n\n4. **Public Trust and Accountability**: The rule of law fosters public trust in the legal system by ensuring that government actions are based on established laws and that there are mechanisms for accountability. This principle encourages citizens to respect and adhere to laws, as they believe those laws are applied fairly and justly.\n\n5. **Doctrine of Ultra Vires**: This principle states that any action taken beyond the powers granted by the Constitution is invalid. It reinforces the limits of governmental authority and protects citizens from arbitrary actions by the state.\n\nThese principles collectively form the foundation of Singapore's legal and political framework, ensuring a balanced and fair governance system that upholds the rights of individuals while maintaining order and accountability within the government.
