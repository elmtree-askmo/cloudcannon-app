    What types of deception detection tests are used in India?
answer: >-
    In India, several types of deception detection tests (DDTs) are employed, primarily for investigative purposes during interrogations. The three most common types are:\n\n1. **Polygraph Test**: Often referred to as a "lie detector" test, this method measures physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject answers questions. The underlying assumption is that these physiological changes can indicate deception.\n\n2. **Narco-analysis**: This technique involves administering a drug (usually a barbiturate) to induce a state of altered consciousness, during which the subject may be more likely to divulge information. It is controversial due to ethical concerns regarding consent and the reliability of the information obtained.\n\n3. **Brain Mapping (P300 Waves Test)**: This method analyzes brain activity in response to stimuli, particularly focusing on the P300 wave, which is believed to be associated with recognition and deception. It is a more recent development in the field of deception detection.\n\nAdditionally, **Stress Voice Analysis** is another method that examines voice patterns for signs of stress, which are thought to correlate with lying.\n\nDespite the use of these tests, their legality and ethical implications have been subjects of debate in India. A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 2010 emphasized that DDTs should only be conducted with the consent of the accused and cannot be used as direct evidence in court. The Court highlighted the importance of respecting individual rights and privacy, raising concerns about the invasive nature and reliability of these tests.\n\nOverall, while deception detection tests are utilized in various criminal investigations in India, their application is fraught with legal and ethical challenges, particularly concerning the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
