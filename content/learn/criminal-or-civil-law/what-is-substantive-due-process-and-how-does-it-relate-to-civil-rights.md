    What is substantive due process and how does it relate to civil rights?
answer: >-
    Substantive due process is a principle in United States constitutional law that protects certain fundamental rights from government interference, even if those rights are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. This principle is derived from the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which state that no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." \n\nThe concept of substantive due process allows courts to evaluate the substance of laws and government actions to ensure they do not infringe upon fundamental rights. For instance, the Supreme Court's interpretation of substantive due process has evolved over time, with significant cases such as *Lochner v. New York* (1905), where the Court struck down a law regulating bakers' working hours, asserting that it violated the bakers' right to work under their own terms.\n\nSubstantive due process is particularly relevant to civil rights as it has been used to protect various liberties that are essential to individual autonomy and dignity. For example, the Supreme Court has recognized rights related to privacy, marriage, and family life under this doctrine. The application of substantive due process has played a crucial role in landmark civil rights cases, including those that addressed issues such as reproductive rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn summary, substantive due process serves as a safeguard against arbitrary government actions that could infringe upon fundamental rights, thereby reinforcing the protection of civil liberties in the United States.
