    What are the quorum requirements for voting in Parliament?
answer: >-
    In the context of the legislative process in Singapore, the quorum requirements for voting in Parliament are outlined in Article 56 of the Constitution. A quorum is defined as the minimum number of Members of Parliament (MPs) that must be present for parliamentary proceedings to be valid. Specifically, Article 56 states that if less than one-quarter of the total number of members are present, there is no quorum, and thus, no valid proceedings can take place.\n\nIf a quorum is not met, the Speaker of Parliament is required to adjourn the session if there is still no quorum after the interval prescribed by the Standing Orders. Additionally, if a vote is taken without a quorum, that vote may be considered invalid.\n\nOnce a quorum is established, Article 57 specifies that most bills require a majority of the votes of the members present and voting to pass. This means that more than 50% of those present and voting must support the bill for it to be approved. For constitutional amendments, a two-thirds majority of all elected MPs and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) is required.\n\nIt is also important to note that no proxies are allowed in the voting process, meaning that absent members cannot appoint someone else to vote on their behalf. \n\nIn summary, the quorum requirement for voting in Parliament is at least one-quarter of the total number of members, and a simple majority of those present and voting is needed to pass most bills.
