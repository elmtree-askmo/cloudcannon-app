    What were Madison's financial dealings and how did they relate to the crime?
answer: >-
    Madison Rutherford, originally named John Sankey, was involved in a significant financial crime that revolved around an elaborate insurance fraud scheme. He faked his own death in an attempt to collect $7 million in insurance money. This scheme was not only deceitful but also involved the desecration of a grave, as human remains were placed in the car that was purportedly involved in his "accident."\n\nRutherford's financial dealings were characterized by manipulation and deceit. He had previously worked as a financial adviser in Connecticut and had a history of fraudulent activities, which included commingling funds from various individuals, including his partner, Brigitte Beck. Beck had invested a substantial amount of money with Rutherford, believing it was safe, but it was later revealed that he had mismanaged her funds. This mismanagement contributed to the financial instability and emotional distress experienced by his victims.\n\nAfter serving time for his fraud convictions, Rutherford attempted to start anew by opening a sports bar in South Carolina under the name "Bey." However, his past continued to haunt him, and he became the subject of a Forensic Files episode titled "Past Lives," which aired in 2004 while he was serving his second prison term.\n\nOverall, Madison Rutherford's financial dealings were deeply intertwined with his criminal activities, showcasing the impact of financial crime on victims and the lengths to which individuals may go to deceive others for personal gain.
