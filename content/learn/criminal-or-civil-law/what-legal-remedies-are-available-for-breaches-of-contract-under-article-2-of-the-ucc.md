    What legal remedies are available for breaches of contract under Article 2 of the UCC?
answer: >-
    Under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), several legal remedies are available for breaches of contract in the context of the sale of goods. These remedies are designed to ensure that the aggrieved party is compensated and can be put in as good a position as if the contract had been performed. Here are the key remedies available:\n\n1. **Buyer's Remedies**:\n   - **Cancellation**: The buyer may cancel the contract if the seller fails to deliver goods or if the delivered goods are defective.\n   - **Damages for Non-Delivery**: If the seller fails to deliver, the buyer is entitled to damages equal to the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time the buyer learned of the breach, plus any incidental and consequential damages, less any expenses saved due to the breach.\n   - **Damages for Accepted Goods**: If the buyer has accepted goods that are non-conforming, they can recover damages for the difference between the value of the goods as accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted.\n   - **Incidental and Consequential Damages**: Buyers can also recover incidental damages, which include expenses incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care of goods rightfully rejected, as well as consequential damages, which may include lost profits from the inability to resell the goods.\n\n2. **Seller's Remedies**:\n   - **Right to Identify Goods**: The seller has the right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding a breach, and can salvage unfinished goods.\n   - **Damages for Non-Acceptance**: If the buyer fails to accept the goods, the seller can recover damages equal to the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price, along with any incidental damages.\n   - **Incidental Damages**: Sellers can also recover incidental damages incurred due to the buyer's breach, such as costs related to storing or reselling the goods.\n\n3. **General Principles**:\n   - The UCC emphasizes that remedies should be administered to ensure that the aggrieved party is compensated adequately.\n   - Both parties typically must prove the existence of a breach and their entitlement to the specific remedy sought.\n\nThese remedies under the UCC differ from those available under common law, reflecting the unique nature of commercial transactions involving the sale of goods. The UCC aims to provide a flexible and fair framework for resolving disputes arising from such transactions.
