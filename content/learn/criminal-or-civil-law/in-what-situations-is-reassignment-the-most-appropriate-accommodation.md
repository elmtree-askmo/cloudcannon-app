    In what situations is reassignment the most appropriate accommodation?
answer: >-
    Reassignment as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is most appropriate in several specific situations:\n\n1. **Inability to Perform Current Job**: Reassignment is warranted when an employee with a disability can no longer perform the essential functions of their current position, even with reasonable accommodations. If the employee is unable to fulfill their job duties due to their disability, reassignment to a vacant position for which they are qualified can help maintain their employment.\n\n2. **Voluntary Agreement**: Reassignment may also be appropriate when both the employer and the employee agree that it is preferable for the employee to be reassigned rather than remain in their current position with accommodations. This mutual agreement can facilitate a smoother transition and better job satisfaction.\n\n3. **Upcoming Vacancies**: If there are no vacant positions available at the time of the request, but the employer is aware that an equivalent position will become available in the near future, the employer should plan to reassign the employee to that position when it opens up. This proactive approach helps ensure that the employee's needs are met without unnecessary delays.\n\n4. **Undue Hardship Considerations**: If holding the employee's current position for an extended period creates an undue hardship for the employer, reassignment to a vacant equivalent position can be a reasonable solution. This allows the employer to manage operational needs while still accommodating the employee's disability.\n\n5. **No Requirement for Competition**: Under the ADA, when reassignment is deemed necessary, the employee does not have to compete for the vacant position. They must be minimally qualified for the role, meaning they can perform the essential functions of the job, with or without accommodation. This provision helps protect the rights of employees with disabilities by ensuring they have access to available positions without the added pressure of competition.\n\n6. **Not a Promotion**: It is important to note that reassignment does not include promotions. The employer is not required to create a new position or displace other employees to accommodate the reassignment. The focus is on finding a suitable existing position that the employee can fill.\n\nIn summary, reassignment is most appropriate when an employee cannot perform their current job due to a disability, when both parties agree to the reassignment, when there are upcoming vacancies, and when it does not impose an undue hardship on the employer. This process is guided by the principles of the ADA and the enforcement guidance provided by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
