    How have the public and political entities reacted to the judiciary-executive controversies?
answer: >-
    The public and political entities have reacted to the controversies surrounding the judiciary-executive relations in India with a mix of concern, criticism, and calls for reform. The judiciary in India has historically enjoyed a high level of public trust, often viewed as an institution that operates independently and based on legal reasoning. However, recent developments have raised alarms about the erosion of this independence.\n\n1. **Public Trust and Perception**: The federal judiciary has long held a deep public trust, significantly exceeding that of the legislature or executive. However, there is growing concern among citizens regarding the increasing alignment of the judiciary with the government, particularly in judicial appointments and verdicts that appear to favor the ruling party. This shift has led to fears about the erosion of judicial independence, which is critical for maintaining checks and balances within the government.\n\n2. **Political Criticism**: Political entities, especially opposition parties, have been vocal in their criticism of the current government's attempts to exert influence over the judiciary. Critics argue that the government's actions have led to a crisis in the relationship between the judiciary and the executive, with accusations of the executive branch attempting to "clip the judiciary's wings." This has been particularly evident in the context of judicial appointments, where the current administration has been accused of undermining the established collegium system that was designed to ensure judicial independence.\n\n3. **Judicial Backlog and Systemic Issues**: The judiciary is currently facing a significant backlog of over 50 million criminal and civil cases, which has been exacerbated by political interference and a lack of legislative action. This backlog not only hampers the delivery of justice but also reflects systemic issues within the judicial system that require urgent reform. Public opinion is increasingly recognizing the need for reforms to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and expedite the judicial process.\n\n4. **Media Influence**: The media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception of the judiciary. How the judiciary is portrayed in the media can significantly influence public opinion, which in turn affects the judiciary's standing and its ability to operate independently. The portrayal of judicial controversies can lead to divided public opinion, similar to other political institutions.\n\nIn summary, the reaction to the judiciary-executive controversies in India has been characterized by a growing concern over judicial independence, criticism from political entities, and a recognition of the need for systemic reforms to address the challenges facing the judiciary. The interplay between public perception, political criticism, and media representation continues to shape the discourse around these issues.
