    What is the role of faithless electors in the Electoral College?
answer: >-
    Faithless electors are members of the Electoral College who do not cast their votes for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates to whom they are pledged. This phenomenon has occurred sporadically throughout U.S. history, with a total of 165 electors deviating from their pledged votes across 59 elections. However, it is important to note that faithless electors have never changed the outcome of a presidential election, as more than 99.99% of electors have cast their votes as pledged.\n\nThe reasons for electors acting as faithless can vary. Some have voted for different candidates as a form of protest, while others have made idiosyncratic or strategic votes. For instance, in the 2000 election, a Colorado elector voted for John Kasich instead of Hillary Clinton, despite state laws requiring them to vote for the winner of the popular vote. In 2016, there was a notable movement among electors to exercise independent judgment, which led to several electors casting votes contrary to their pledges.\n\nAs of 2020, 33 states and the District of Columbia have laws that require electors to vote for the candidates they are pledged to, although enforcement mechanisms vary. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of states to enforce these laws, as seen in the cases of *Chiafalo v. Washington* and *Colorado Department of State v. Baca*, which confirmed that states can impose penalties on faithless electors.\n\nHistorically, faithless electors have acted alone, and attempts to coordinate votes among multiple electors have generally been unsuccessful. The most significant instance of faithless electors influencing an election occurred in the case of Richard Mentor Johnson, where a mass defection of electors pushed the election into the House of Representatives for resolution.\n\nIn summary, while faithless electors represent a unique aspect of the Electoral College, their impact on presidential elections has been minimal, and they have not altered the final outcomes of elections in U.S. history.
