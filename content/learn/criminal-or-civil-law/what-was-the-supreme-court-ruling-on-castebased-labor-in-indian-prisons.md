    What was the Supreme Court ruling on caste-based labor in Indian prisons?
answer: >-
    On December 12, 2023, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark ruling declaring caste-based discrimination in prisons to be unconstitutional. This decision arose from a writ petition filed by journalist Sukanya Shantha, which challenged various state prison manuals that perpetuated caste-based division of labor, segregation, and discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNT) communities, labeling them as "habitual offenders," a classification rooted in colonial-era practices.\n\nThe Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, found that the assignment of labor based on caste was not voluntary and constituted "forced labor," which is prohibited under Article 23 of the Indian Constitution. The Court emphasized that there should be no stigma attached to any individual based on their caste and that the right to live with dignity extends to all individuals, including those incarcerated.\n\nIn its ruling, the Court ordered the central and state governments to revise their prison manuals within three months to eliminate any provisions that allow for caste-based discrimination. The judgment highlighted that such practices violate fundamental human dignity and personality, and it specifically noted that the segregation of work according to caste hierarchy and the treatment of certain inmates as "habitual offenders" were oppressive.\n\nThis ruling is a significant step towards dismantling institutional biases within India's correctional system and ensuring that the rights of prisoners are upheld in accordance with constitutional mandates.
