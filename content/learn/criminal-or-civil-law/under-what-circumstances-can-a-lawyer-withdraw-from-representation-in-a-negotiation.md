    Under what circumstances can a lawyer withdraw from representation in a negotiation?
answer: >-
    A lawyer may withdraw from representation in a negotiation under several circumstances, as outlined by the relevant rules of professional conduct. Here are the key conditions under which a lawyer can withdraw:\n\n1. **Mandatory Withdrawal**: According to Rule 1.16(a), a lawyer must withdraw from representing a client if:\n   - The representation will result in a violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law.\n   - The lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs their ability to represent the client.\n   - The lawyer is discharged by the client.\n\n2. **Discretionary Withdrawal**: Rule 1.16(c) allows a lawyer to withdraw from representation if:\n   - The withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client.\n   - The client persists in a course of action that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent.\n   - The client fails to substantially fulfill an obligation to the lawyer, such as timely payment for services.\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: When considering withdrawal, a lawyer must also be mindful of their duty of confidentiality and should generally provide a statement indicating that professional considerations require termination of the representation. \n\n4. **Procedural Requirements**: Whether the withdrawal is mandatory or discretionary, the lawyer must adhere to procedural requirements, which may include filing a formal motion to withdraw in court if the representation involves ongoing litigation.\n\n5. **Client's Best Interests**: Before making a final decision to withdraw, the attorney should explore all possible alternatives, such as mediation or negotiation, and ensure that the decision is made in the best interest of the client.\n\nIn summary, a lawyer can withdraw from representation in a negotiation for mandatory reasons such as ethical violations or impairment, as well as discretionary reasons where the withdrawal does not adversely affect the clientâ€™s interests.
