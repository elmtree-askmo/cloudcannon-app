    Labor movements in the United States have significantly influenced changes in labor laws and practices over the years. Here are some key changes that resulted from these movements:\n\n1. **National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935**: Also known as the Wagner Act, this landmark legislation established the right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. It created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to oversee union elections and investigate unfair labor practices. This act marked a significant turning point in labor relations, providing workers with legal protections to form unions and engage in collective activities.\n\n2. **Public Sector Collective Bargaining Laws**: In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a wave of reforms that extended collective bargaining rights to public sector employees. This was a crucial development as it allowed government workers to negotiate wages, benefits, and working conditions, which had previously been largely unregulated.\n\n3. **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**: Originally passed in 1938, this act established minimum wage, overtime pay eligibility, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards. Labor movements played a vital role in advocating for these protections, which have been essential in improving working conditions for millions of American workers.\n\n4. **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970**: Labor movements were instrumental in pushing for safer working conditions, leading to the establishment of OSHA. This act aimed to ensure workplace safety and health standards, significantly reducing workplace injuries and fatalities.\n\n5. **Anti-Retaliation Provisions**: Recent labor movements have leveraged anti-retaliation provisions in federal employment and civil rights laws to protect workers who engage in concerted activities. This has empowered workers to speak out against unfair practices without fear of losing their jobs.\n\n6. **Local Ordinances for Gig Workers**: In response to the changing nature of work, labor movements have advocated for local laws that extend collective bargaining rights to gig workers and independent contractors, who were previously excluded from national labor law protections.\n\n7. **Social Bargaining and Co-enforcement**: Labor organizations have increasingly engaged in "social bargaining" strategies, collaborating with government entities to set employment standards at various levels. This approach has led to stronger partnerships between worker organizations and government agencies to enforce labor standards.\n\n8. **Private Attorneys General Laws**: These laws allow individual employees to file lawsuits on behalf of themselves and others for violations of labor statutes, effectively empowering workers to seek justice and hold employers accountable.\n\nOverall, labor movements have been pivotal in shaping labor laws and practices in the United States, advocating for workers' rights, safety, and fair treatment in the workplace. The ongoing evolution of these movements continues to address contemporary issues such as wage disparities, workplace safety, and the rights of non-traditional workers.
