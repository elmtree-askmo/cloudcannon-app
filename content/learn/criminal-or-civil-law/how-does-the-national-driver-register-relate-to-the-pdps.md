    How does the National Driver Register relate to the PDPS?
answer: >-
    The National Driver Register (NDR) is closely related to the Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) as it serves as the managing body for this computerized database. The PDPS contains critical information about individuals whose driving privileges have been revoked, suspended, canceled, or denied, as well as those who have been convicted of serious traffic violations.\n\nWhen a jurisdiction's driver licensing officials conduct a search of the PDPS, they are essentially querying the NDR to determine the driving status of an individual. The PDPS will "point" the State of Inquiry (SOI) to the State of Record (SOR), where the individual's detailed driver status and history information is maintained. This process is essential for ensuring that individuals applying for new driver's licenses or renewing existing ones are not eligible to drive if their privileges have been withdrawn.\n\nFurthermore, the NDR requires participating states to submit identifying information about drivers with revoked licenses, which includes their name, date of birth, gender, driver license number, and the reporting state. This information is crucial for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date database that can be accessed by all 51 U.S. jurisdictions, thereby enhancing road safety and compliance with driving regulations. \n\nIn summary, the NDR and PDPS work together to provide a comprehensive system for tracking problem drivers and ensuring that licensing decisions are made based on accurate and current information.
