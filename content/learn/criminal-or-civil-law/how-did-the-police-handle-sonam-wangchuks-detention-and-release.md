    How did the police handle Sonam Wangchuk's detention and release?
answer: >-
    Sonam Wangchuk, a prominent climate activist from Ladakh, was detained by the Delhi Police along with several other protesters while attempting to participate in a 'Chalo Dilli' march aimed at raising awareness about climate issues. The detainment occurred late on a Monday night at the Delhi border as they sought to enter the capital for their protest.\n\nFollowing their detention, Wangchuk and the other activists began a hunger strike while in police custody. They were held for nearly 36 hours before being released on Wednesday, October 2, 2024. The release was facilitated by the withdrawal of prohibitory orders on public assembly by the Delhi Police, as confirmed by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta during a hearing at the Delhi High Court. The court was informed that the activists' movements were no longer restricted, allowing Wangchuk to visit Rajghat after his release.\n\nThe situation surrounding Wangchuk's detention and subsequent release highlights ongoing tensions between climate activists and authorities in India, as well as the legal challenges faced by those seeking to organize peaceful protests.
