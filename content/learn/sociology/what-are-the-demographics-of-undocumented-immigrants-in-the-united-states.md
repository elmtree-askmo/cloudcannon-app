    What are the demographics of undocumented immigrants in the United States?
answer: >-
    As of 2022, the estimated population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States is approximately 11 million, with some estimates suggesting a figure around 11.39 million. This population has stabilized after a period of rapid growth. Unauthorized immigrants, also referred to as undocumented immigrants, represent about 14.3% of the total U.S. population, which translates to roughly 1 in 7 residents.\n\nDemographically, the unauthorized immigrant population is diverse, with significant representation from various countries. Notably, around 4 million of these individuals are from Mexico, which accounts for a substantial portion of the total unauthorized immigrant population. The share of Mexican immigrants in the overall U.S. immigrant population has decreased from 29% in 2010 to 23% in 2022.\n\nThe demographics of undocumented immigrants also include variations in age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Reports indicate that unauthorized immigrants contribute significantly to the U.S. workforce across various industries, and they play a crucial role in the economy despite facing numerous barriers to health care and other services.\n\nFor a more detailed understanding of the demographics, including educational attainment, English proficiency, and employment characteristics, further research and data analysis would be beneficial.
