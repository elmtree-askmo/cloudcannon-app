    What are the main demands of the student protesters in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The main demands of the student protesters in Manipur are centered around addressing the ongoing violence and ensuring the safety and integrity of the state. Specifically, the protesters have articulated six key demands, which include:\n\n1. **Removal of Key Officials**: They are calling for the removal of the Director General of Police (DGP) and the Security Advisor to the state government, citing their failure to control the recent violence and unrest.\n\n2. **Action Against Violence**: The protesters are demanding decisive action against those responsible for recent drone and missile attacks that resulted in fatalities and injuries among civilians.\n\n3. **Restoration of Peace**: There is a strong emphasis on the need for restoring peace in the strife-torn state, which has been plagued by ethnic violence for over a year.\n\n4. **Protection of Territorial Integrity**: The students are advocating for the protection of Manipur's "territorial and administrative integrity," reflecting concerns over the state's governance and security.\n\n5. **Justice for Victims**: They are also demanding justice for victims of violence, particularly in light of recent brutal incidents, including the suspected murder of two minor students.\n\n6. **Response from Authorities**: The protesters have given a 24-hour deadline for the Governor of Manipur, Lakshman Prasad Acharya, to respond to their demands, indicating the urgency of their concerns.\n\nThese protests have been a reaction to the escalating law and order issues in Manipur, particularly following the recent attacks that have heightened tensions in the region. The situation has led to the imposition of curfews and internet bans as authorities attempt to manage the unrest.
