    What is the historical context of the social model of disability?
answer: >-
    The historical context of the social model of disability is rooted in the disability rights movement, which gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s. This model emerged as a response to the prevailing medical model of disability, which viewed disability primarily as a deficiency or impairment within the individual. Instead, the social model shifts the focus to the societal barriers and negative attitudes that disable individuals, emphasizing that disability is not an inherent trait but rather a result of the interaction between individuals and their environment.\n\nOne of the key developments in the formation of the social model was the publication of the "Fundamental Principles of Disability" by the Union of Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) in 1975. This document laid the ideological groundwork for the social model by arguing that disability arises from societal oppression rather than individual limitations. The model gained further traction in the 1980s, particularly through the work of scholars like Mike Oliver, who articulated the distinction between impairment (the physical or mental condition) and disability (the social disadvantage that results from that condition).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the social model of disability became a central tenet of disability studies and activism, influencing policies and practices aimed at promoting equality and inclusion for disabled individuals. The model also found resonance in North America, where it paralleled the civil rights movement, applying similar principles of social justice to the experiences of disabled people.\n\nOver the years, various interpretations of the social model have emerged, including Carol Thomas's suggestion to reframe it as the "social relational model of disability," which further explores the complexities of disability in relation to social relationships and power dynamics.\n\nOverall, the social model of disability has played a crucial role in reshaping the discourse around disability, advocating for a rights-based approach that seeks to dismantle barriers and promote the full participation of disabled individuals in society.
