    What support services are available for foster families through CAST?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) offers a variety of support services for foster families to ensure they can provide a stable and nurturing environment for children in their care. Here are the key support services available:\n\n1. **Foster Care Support Worker**: Each foster family is assigned a Foster Care Support Worker who collaborates with them to create a personalized plan for ongoing training and support. This relationship is crucial for addressing the unique needs of each foster family.\n\n2. **Training and Workshops**: CAST recognizes the importance of continuous learning for foster parents. They provide regular workshops and courses designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of foster families, helping them to better support the children in their care.\n\n3. **Financial Support**: Foster parents receive monthly reimbursements to help cover the costs associated with caring for the children. This financial assistance is intended to support the basic needs of the children, such as food, clothing, and other essentials.\n\n4. **Community Resources**: CAST works in partnership with the community to provide additional resources and support for foster families. This includes access to various community programs that can assist in meeting the needs of both the foster parents and the children.\n\n5. **Family Support Program**: This program offers help to families in the community, including resource families (kinship and foster). It aims to strengthen the capacity of families to provide safe environments for children and youth.\n\n6. **Access to Locations**: Support services are available at CAST's main locations, including 2206 Eglinton Ave. E and Robertson House on Keele Street, as well as shared community partnership spaces throughout Toronto.\n\nThese services are designed to empower foster families, ensuring they have the necessary tools and support to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children who cannot live with their birth families.
