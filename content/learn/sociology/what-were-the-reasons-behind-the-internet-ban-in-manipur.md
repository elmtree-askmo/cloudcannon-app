    What were the reasons behind the internet ban in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The internet ban in Manipur was primarily implemented as a response to escalating violence and unrest in the region. The government imposed the shutdown on May 3, 2023, following violent protests that erupted over the killings of several individuals, which led to widespread agitation and demands for military action and the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). The authorities aimed to prevent the spread of misinformation and to maintain law and order during this period of heightened tensions.\n\nThe internet shutdown was part of a broader strategy employed by the Indian government to address various issues, including cheating in examinations, protests, law and order concerns, and communal violence. This tactic has been criticized as a quick-fix solution that often exacerbates the situation rather than resolving underlying conflicts. In Manipur, the internet services were suspended in response to protests from students against ethnic violence, which had been ongoing for over a year.\n\nThe situation in Manipur reflects a pattern of internet shutdowns in India, where such measures have been increasingly used to control civil unrest and maintain public order. The state experienced a significant number of hours of internet shutdowns, with the total reaching around 5000 hours in 2023 alone, highlighting the severity and frequency of these measures in response to civil disturbances.
