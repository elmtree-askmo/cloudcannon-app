    The government's response to the recent floods in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has involved both state and central efforts to provide relief and support to the affected populations. \n\n1. **State Government Initiatives**: \n   - Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu announced an ex-gratia compensation of ₹5 lakh for the families of flood victims. This measure aims to provide immediate financial assistance to those who have lost loved ones due to the floods.\n   - In Telangana, Chief Minister Revanth Reddy declared an immediate relief fund of ₹5 crore for the districts most affected by the floods, including Khammam, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Mahbubabad, and Suryapet. He is also considering urging the central government to declare the floods a national calamity to facilitate further assistance.\n\n2. **Central Government Support**: \n   - The Government of India has announced a substantial relief package of ₹3,300 crore to assist both states in addressing the aftermath of the floods. This package is intended to support recovery efforts and infrastructure repairs.\n   - Union Home Minister Amit Shah stated that the Centre is closely monitoring the flood situation and has constituted a team of experts to visit the affected areas for on-the-spot assessments and recommendations for immediate relief.\n\n3. **Community and Political Involvement**: \n   - Various political leaders and community members are actively participating in relief efforts. Opposition leaders, including Congress leader Sharmila, have been involved in relief programs in Andhra Pradesh, while public figures like actor Allu Arjun have also contributed by donating to the Chief Minister's Relief Funds.\n\nOverall, the response has been characterized by a coordinated effort between state and central governments, with a focus on providing immediate financial assistance and assessing the long-term needs for recovery and rebuilding in the affected regions.
