    What measures are in place for the protection of indigenous communities in Assam?
answer: >-
    In Assam, several measures have been implemented to protect the rights and interests of indigenous communities, particularly in light of ongoing socio-political challenges. Here are the key initiatives:\n\n1. **Establishment of Tribal and Heritage Belts**: The Assam government has introduced a comprehensive plan that includes the establishment of Tribal Belt & Block, Micro Tribal Belt & Block, and Heritage Belt & Block. These initiatives aim to safeguard the socio-economic stability of indigenous communities and protect their cultural heritage.\n\n2. **Amendments to Land Regulations**: The Assam Land and Revenue Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2024, has been revised to include provisions for the protection of lands near heritage and iconic structures. This includes the creation of microbelts and blocks in villages to secure the land rights of indigenous communities.\n\n3. **Implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord**: The government is working towards implementing Clause 6 of the Assam Accord, which promises constitutional, legislative, and administrative measures to preserve the cultural, social, and linguistic identity of the Assamese people. This includes enacting 57 recommendations from the Justice Biplab Sarma Commission, which focuses on safeguarding land, language, and culture.\n\n4. **Land Rights for Indigenous Peoples**: The Mission Basundhara 2.0 initiative has been launched to grant equitable land rights to indigenous landless individuals and secure the rights of tribal communities over their hereditary lands. This has resulted in the settlement of significant amounts of land for these communities.\n\n5. **Protection Against Infiltration**: The government has announced measures to protect indigenous people's land from being sold to "infiltrators," ensuring that land ownership is restricted to Assamese individuals in specific revenue circles.\n\n6. **Common Platforms for Advocacy**: Organizations like the United Tribal Organization, Assam (UTOA) serve as platforms for various tribal communities to advocate for their rights and raise issues with the government.\n\nThese measures reflect a concerted effort by the Assam government to address the long-standing demands of indigenous communities and ensure their rights and cultural heritage are preserved amidst changing socio-political dynamics.
