    What are the working conditions in Bangladesh's textile industry?
answer: >-
    The working conditions in Bangladesh's textile industry have been a significant concern, particularly highlighted by tragic events such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza in 2013, which resulted in the deaths of 1,134 garment workers. This incident brought global attention to the unsafe and often abusive working environments prevalent in the industry. \n\nWorkers in Bangladesh's garment factories typically face a range of hazardous conditions, including inadequate ventilation, exposure to toxic substances, and the inhalation of harmful fibers and dust. Many factories operate in unsafe buildings, which are prone to accidents, fires, and structural failures. Reports indicate that workers often endure long hours, with some working between 72 to 81 hours per week, often for very low wages. \n\nThe situation has reportedly worsened since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many workers experiencing deteriorating conditions. Despite some reforms initiated after the Rana Plaza disaster, such as the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Garment and Textile Industry, many workers still lack basic occupational safety and rights protections. \n\nThe Bangladesh Labour Law of 2006 exists to protect workers, but enforcement is often weak, and violations are common. The garment industry is crucial to Bangladesh's economy, accounting for a significant portion of its export revenue, yet this economic reliance has not translated into improved working conditions for the millions employed in the sector.\n\nIn summary, the working conditions in Bangladesh's textile industry are characterized by dangerous environments, long working hours, low wages, and a lack of enforcement of labor laws, leading to widespread human rights violations.
