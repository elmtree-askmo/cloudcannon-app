    How has the government responded to the ethnic tensions in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The government's response to the ethnic tensions in Manipur has been a subject of significant criticism and concern. The violence, which has persisted for several months, primarily involves clashes between the Kuki tribal groups and the majority Meitei community, resulting in over 150 deaths and widespread destruction.\n\nInitially, the state government, led by Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, faced backlash for its delayed response to the escalating violence. Reports indicate that the government defended its inaction by claiming that numerous similar cases had occurred, which contributed to a shutdown of the internet in the region. This response has been criticized as inadequate and has been described by human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, as causing greater harm to the situation.\n\nIn response to the violence, the government has implemented measures such as curfews and internet shutdowns to control the unrest. Additionally, the Union government has ordered social media platforms to remove posts related to a viral video that depicted the brutal assault of two Kuki women, which further inflamed tensions. The Supreme Court of India has also intervened, warning that it would monitor the government's actions regarding the violence and the treatment of victims.\n\nDespite these measures, the situation remains volatile, with ongoing protests and demonstrations against the government's handling of the crisis. The ethnic divide has deepened, and many believe that the government's failure to act swiftly has exacerbated the conflict. Calls for urgent measures to protect vulnerable communities and de-escalate violence have been made, emphasizing the need for a more effective and compassionate approach to resolving the underlying issues driving the ethnic tensions in Manipur.\n\nOverall, the government's response has been characterized by a mix of security measures and public outcry, highlighting the complexities of addressing ethnic violence in a region with a long history of conflict.
