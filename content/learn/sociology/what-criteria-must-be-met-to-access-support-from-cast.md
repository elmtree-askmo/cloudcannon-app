    What criteria must be met to access support from CAST?
answer: >-
    To access support from the Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST), certain criteria must be met, primarily revolving around the safety and well-being of children and youth. The following points summarize the key criteria:\n\n1. **Age Requirement**: The support is available for children and youth from birth to 17 years of age.\n\n2. **Reasonable Grounds for Protection**: There must be reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection. This includes situations where a child is at risk of experiencing abuse or neglect, which can be physical, sexual, or emotional in nature.\n\n3. **Involvement of Families and Communities**: CAST emphasizes working with parents, caregivers, and the community to provide safe environments for children. Therefore, families seeking support should be open to collaboration and utilizing community resources.\n\n4. **Assessment of Needs**: When a family becomes involved with CAST, an assessment is conducted to determine the specific needs of the child or youth and the family. This assessment is guided by the Ontario Child Welfare Eligibility Spectrum, which helps identify the level of intervention required.\n\n5. **Culturally Relevant Resources**: Families are encouraged to connect with culturally relevant resources and supports that can strengthen their family unit and help maintain a safe environment for the child or youth.\n\nThese criteria ensure that CAST can effectively provide the necessary support to families while prioritizing the safety and well-being of children and youth in the community.
