answer: >-
    In response to the devastating floods that have affected Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, several relief measures have been implemented to assist the victims:\n\n1. **Financial Compensation**: The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹5 lakh (approximately $6,000) to the families of those who lost their lives in the floods. This measure aims to provide immediate financial support to the bereaved families.\n\n2. **Government Relief Packages**: The Government of India has announced a substantial relief package of ₹3,300 crore to assist both states in addressing the aftermath of the floods. Additionally, the Agriculture Minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has committed ₹3,448 crore in immediate assistance from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to mitigate the impact of the floods.\n\n3. **Central Government Support**: The Union Home Ministry has been actively monitoring the situation and has constituted a team of experts to assess the flood-affected areas. This team will make recommendations for immediate relief measures.\n\n4. **Distribution of Relief Kits**: Organizations and local initiatives have also contributed to the relief efforts. For instance, ServiceNow provided 500 relief kits, which were distributed to families in need, particularly in Khammam District.\n\n5. **Agricultural Support**: The government plans to provide fertilizers and seeds for the next crop cycle and ensure appropriate compensation after assessing the damage to crops caused by the floods.\n\n6. **Community and Local Efforts**: Local leaders and organizations are participating in relief programs, providing essential services such as clean water and medical care to help families navigate the challenges posed by the floods.\n\nThese measures reflect a coordinated effort between state and central governments, as well as community organizations, to provide immediate and effective relief to those affected by the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
