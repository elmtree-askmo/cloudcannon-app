answer: >-
    A claim of policy is a statement that advocates for a specific course of action or change in policies, laws, or practices. It typically addresses issues of societal importance and aims to persuade an audience to support a particular position or action regarding those issues. The characteristics of a claim of policy include:\n\n1. **Advocacy for Action**: It explicitly calls for a specific action to be taken or a change to be made. This could involve new laws, regulations, or practices.\n\n2. **Addressing Societal Issues**: Claims of policy often focus on significant societal problems or issues that require resolution.\n\n3. **Sub-claims of Fact and Value**: These claims usually involve sub-claims that establish the need for a policy change (fact) and the desirability of that change (value). This means that the argument must provide evidence that a problem exists and that the proposed solution is beneficial.\n\n4. **Debate Structure**: They are often structured to promote a pro versus con debate, allowing for multiple viewpoints to be presented and discussed.\n\n5. **Evidence and Logic**: Effective claims of policy are supported by logical reasoning and credible evidence, which may include statistics, expert opinions, and case studies.\n\n### Example of a Claim of Policy:\n"All professional athletes should be randomly drug-tested." \n\nThis claim advocates for a specific action (random drug testing) and addresses the societal issue of drug use in sports. It implies that there is a need for such a policy (sub-claim of fact) and suggests that implementing this policy would be beneficial for the integrity of sports (sub-claim of value).
