    How does planned obsolescence affect environmental sustainability?
answer: >-
    Planned obsolescence significantly impacts environmental sustainability by contributing to increased resource consumption, waste generation, and pollution. This marketing strategy involves designing products to have a limited lifespan, compelling consumers to replace them frequently. As a result, the cycle of production and disposal accelerates, leading to several environmental challenges.\n\n1. **Resource Consumption**: The production of new goods requires the extraction and use of natural resources, which can lead to depletion of scarce materials. This is particularly evident in industries such as electronics, where the demand for new devices drives the need for metals and minerals that are often mined unsustainably.\n\n2. **Waste Generation**: Planned obsolescence leads to a significant increase in waste, particularly electronic waste (e-waste). For instance, it is projected that without intervention, 852 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide compounds will be generated from e-waste alone by 2030. In 2019, less than 18% of e-waste was collected and recycled, highlighting the inefficiency in managing this growing problem.\n\n3. **Pollution**: The disposal of products designed for obsolescence often results in pollution. Many discarded items end up in landfills, where they can leach harmful substances into the environment. Additionally, the manufacturing processes for new products can contribute to air and water pollution.\n\n4. **Consumer Behavior**: The practice of planned obsolescence fosters a culture of disposability, where consumers are encouraged to prioritize short-term satisfaction over long-term sustainability. This behavior not only affects individual purchasing decisions but also shapes broader societal norms around consumption.\n\nAddressing the environmental impacts of planned obsolescence requires collaborative efforts among manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers. Strategies such as promoting sustainable consumption practices, implementing e-waste recycling programs, and encouraging product durability and repairability can help mitigate these negative effects. For example, initiatives like France's repairability index aim to score products based on their ease of repair, thereby incentivizing manufacturers to design more sustainable products.\n\nIn summary, planned obsolescence poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability, necessitating a shift towards more responsible consumption and production practices to reduce waste and conserve resources.
