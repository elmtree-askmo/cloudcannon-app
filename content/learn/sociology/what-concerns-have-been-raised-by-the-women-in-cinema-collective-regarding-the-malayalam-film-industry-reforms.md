    What concerns have been raised by the Women in Cinema Collective regarding the Malayalam film industry reforms?
answer: >-
    The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) has raised several concerns regarding the reforms in the Malayalam film industry, primarily focusing on gender equality and the safety of women in the sector. Here are the key points of concern:\n\n1. **Formation of an Autonomous Statutory Commission**: WCC has proposed the establishment of an autonomous statutory commission, which would be headed by stakeholders from the Malayalam film industry. This commission is intended to ensure compliance with a proposed Cinema Code of Conduct, aimed at addressing gender issues and promoting a safer working environment for women.\n\n2. **Implementation of Anti-Harassment Measures**: The collective has called for the creation of anti-harassment cells during film production. This is a direct response to the longstanding issues of harassment and discrimination faced by women in the industry, which have been highlighted by various incidents, including the high-profile sexual assault case involving a prominent actress in 2017.\n\n3. **Increased Representation**: WCC advocates for increased representation of women in all aspects of filmmaking, from production to direction and beyond. This is seen as essential for creating a more equitable industry that reflects diverse voices and experiences.\n\n4. **Response to the Hema Committee Report**: The WCC's formation was partly a response to the Hema Committee, which was established by the state government to investigate the challenges faced by women in the Malayalam film industry. The collective has been actively involved in discussions surrounding the implementation of the committee's recommendations, which were made public only in August 2020, several months after their submission.\n\n5. **Cultural and Structural Changes**: The WCC aims to challenge the patriarchal structures that have historically dominated the industry. They emphasize the need for cultural shifts that promote gender-neutral practices and dismantle the misogynistic attitudes that have persisted within the film community.\n\n6. **Solidarity and Collective Action**: The WCC has called for solidarity among industry members to adopt the proposed Cinema Code of Conduct, which they believe will help transform the industry both on-screen and off-screen.\n\nOverall, the Women in Cinema Collective is focused on advocating for systemic changes that will create a safer, more equitable environment for women in the Malayalam film industry, addressing both immediate concerns and long-term structural issues.
