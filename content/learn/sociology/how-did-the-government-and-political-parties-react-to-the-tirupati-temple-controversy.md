    How did the government and political parties react to the Tirupati Temple controversy?
answer: >-
    The Tirupati Temple controversy has elicited significant reactions from both the government and various political parties in India. The controversy began when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu alleged that lab reports indicated that the laddus offered at the Tirupati temple were contaminated with animal and vegetable fat. This claim was particularly contentious as the temple is a revered site that attracts millions of devotees annually.\n\nIn response to the allegations, the government directed the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) Executive Officer to prepare a comprehensive report on the matter, with further actions to be determined based on the findings. The Supreme Court also became involved, reprimanding Naidu for making public allegations without sufficient evidence and emphasizing that the issue should not be politicized. The court ordered an independent investigation into the claims, highlighting the need to address the sentiments of the millions of devotees affected by the controversy.\n\nPolitical reactions were swift and varied. The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), led by former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, accused Naidu of making "heinous allegations" and pointed out that he was in power when the alleged adulterated ghee was supplied. In contrast, the Congress party called for a full-fledged inquiry to identify those responsible for the alleged adulteration.\n\nAdditionally, YV Subba Reddy, a Rajya Sabha MP and former TTD Chairman, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court seeking an independent investigation into the matter. The controversy has not only sparked political debates but has also led to calls for religious rituals to atone for the alleged sins attributed to Naidu's claims.\n\nOverall, the controversy has highlighted the intersection of religion and politics in India, with various parties leveraging the situation to further their agendas while the Supreme Court seeks to ensure a fair investigation into the allegations.
