    What concerns have been raised by members regarding the dissolution of the Standing Committee on Statistics?
answer: >-
    The dissolution of the Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has raised several concerns among its members and the broader public. Key issues highlighted include:\n\n1. **Delay in Census**: Members of the SCoS, led by economist Pronab Sen, had consistently raised alarms regarding the delay in conducting India's decennial census, which was last held in 2011. The census is crucial for mapping the population and is a key source of demographic, economic, and social data. The ongoing delay has implications for data reliability and effective policy-making.\n\n2. **Impact on Data Transparency**: The dissolution has sparked fears about the transparency of data collection processes in India. Critics argue that the lack of a dedicated committee to oversee statistical matters could undermine the integrity of data, which is essential for informed governance.\n\n3. **Concerns Over Democratic Institutions**: The decision to dissolve the committee without clear communication has led to concerns about the health of democratic institutions in India. Opposition parties and commentators have expressed that the move reflects a troubling trend regarding the government's approach to statistical governance and accountability.\n\n4. **Overlapping Responsibilities**: The government cited overlapping responsibilities with the newly formed Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys as a reason for the dissolution. However, this rationale has been met with skepticism, as many believe that the SCoS played a vital role in addressing issues related to statistical methodologies and data collection.\n\n5. **Regaining Prominence of National Statistical Commission**: Following the dissolution of the SCoS, the National Statistical Commission (NSC) has regained prominence as the primary body to address statistical issues. However, there are concerns about whether the NSC can adequately fill the gap left by the SCoS, especially in light of the pressing need for a new census.\n\nOverall, the dissolution of the Standing Committee on Statistics has raised significant concerns regarding the future of statistical governance in India, particularly in the context of the delayed census and the reliability of data used for policy decisions.
