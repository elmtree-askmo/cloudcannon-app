    How did the Bangladesh government respond to the quota system protests?
answer: >-
    In response to the quota system protests in Bangladesh, the government took several significant actions. The protests, which began in June 2024, were triggered by the Supreme Court's reinstatement of a 30% quota for descendants of freedom fighters, reversing a previous government decision made in response to mass protests in 2018. Students expressed concerns that this quota limited their opportunities based on merit.\n\nTo quell the escalating protests, which turned violent with clashes between demonstrators and ruling party supporters, the government declared a curfew and deployed the army to restore order. The situation intensified, leading to reports of numerous casualties among protesters.\n\nIn the wake of the unrest, the Supreme Court intervened by scaling back the quota system, ruling that the veterans' quota should be reduced to 5%, with 93% of government jobs to be allocated based on merit. This decision aimed to address the students' grievances and reduce the tensions surrounding the quota system.\n\nOverall, the government's response included a combination of military intervention, curfews, and judicial rulings to manage the protests and address the contentious issue of job quotas in Bangladesh.
