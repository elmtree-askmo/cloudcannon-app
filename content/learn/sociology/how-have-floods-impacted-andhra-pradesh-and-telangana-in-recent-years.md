    How have floods impacted Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in recent years?
answer: >-
    In recent years, floods have significantly impacted the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, particularly due to heavy rainfall associated with depressions over the Bay of Bengal. For instance, in early September 2024, catastrophic flooding resulted in the deaths of at least 45 individuals and affected approximately 270,000 people in Vijayawada alone, with a total of around 644,000 people impacted across seven districts. The floods were exacerbated by breaches in the Budameru Rivulet, which is often referred to as the 'Sorrow of Vijayawada.'\n\nThe flooding has caused extensive damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods. In Andhra Pradesh, over 6.4 lakh people were reported to be affected, with significant disruptions to transportation, including damage to crucial bridges on national highways. The continuous flow of floodwaters has led to erosion and the washing away of roads, further complicating relief efforts.\n\nEmergency services have been mobilized to rescue stranded individuals and provide relief to affected residents. For example, around 5,000 people were rescued in Andhra Pradesh, and more than 2,000 were relocated to safer areas in Telangana. The Indian government has also stepped in, announcing a relief package of â‚¹3,300 crore to assist both states in managing the aftermath of these devastating floods.\n\nThe heavy rainfall that triggered these floods has been linked to a combination of land-generated heat and coastal moisture circulation, which creates low-level land-based cyclones drawing winds from the Bay of Bengal. This climatic phenomenon has led to extreme weather events, resulting in severe flooding and significant humanitarian challenges in the region.
