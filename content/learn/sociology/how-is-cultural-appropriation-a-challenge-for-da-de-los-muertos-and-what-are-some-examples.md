    How is cultural appropriation a challenge for Día de los Muertos, and what are some examples?
answer: >-
    Cultural appropriation poses a significant challenge for Día de los Muertos, particularly as the holiday gains international popularity. This phenomenon often manifests when individuals or companies outside the culture adopt elements of Día de los Muertos without a proper understanding or respect for its origins and significance. \n\nOne of the primary concerns is the commercialization of the holiday, which can lead to a superficial understanding of its cultural importance. For instance, the sale of costumes, decorations, and packaged goods related to Día de los Muertos often strips the holiday of its deeper meanings, reducing it to mere aesthetic appeal. This commodification can be seen in the rise of "sugar skull" makeup trends, which, while popular among some, can be viewed as a form of appropriation when they are not accompanied by an understanding of the holiday's significance. As noted by Mexican-American makeup artist Valeria Leyva, the trend can be problematic, even as it allows for artistic expression.\n\nA specific example of cultural appropriation occurred with the 2024 collaboration between watchmaker Swatch and The Simpsons, which, despite its generally respectful portrayal of Mexican culture, raised concerns among some observers about the commercialization of Día de los Muertos. This highlights the fine line between cultural appreciation and appropriation, where the latter often involves "cherry-picking" elements of a culture without acknowledging or respecting the people and traditions from which they originate.\n\nMoreover, the misconception that Día de los Muertos is akin to Halloween exacerbates the issue. This misunderstanding can lead to trivialization of the holiday, as it is often celebrated with costumes and parties that do not honor the solemnity and reverence associated with remembering deceased loved ones.\n\nIn summary, while cultural exchange can foster creativity and understanding, the challenges of cultural appropriation in the context of Día de los Muertos underscore the importance of approaching such traditions with respect and awareness of their historical and cultural significance.
