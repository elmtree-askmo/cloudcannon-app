    The long-term goals of the Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation (AMDF) are centered around enacting positive change and supporting humanitarian causes that reflect the spirit of Anne Marie D’Amico. The foundation aims to:\n\n1. **Raise Awareness**: One of the primary objectives is to shift social and cultural norms regarding domestic violence by partnering with organizations and individuals who share their vision. This involves increasing public awareness about the issues faced by women and children in violent situations.\n\n2. **Support for Women and Children**: The foundation is committed to creating a world where women and children can live free from violence. This includes ongoing support for the North York Women's Shelter (NYWS), which has been operational since 1984 and provides a safe haven for women and children in need.\n\n3. **Financial Sustainability**: The AMDF is focused on ensuring its long-term financial health to continue its initiatives. This includes raising significant funds, with a current goal of raising $1 million for the NYWS.\n\n4. **Community Services**: The foundation aims to enhance the services available to women experiencing violence through initiatives like the Anne Marie D'Amico Community Collective, which offers trauma-informed support and wrap-around services to address various barriers women face in accessing help.\n\n5. **Annual Events**: The foundation also seeks to promote kindness and community engagement through events like the Anne Marie D'Amico Day of Kindness and Love, which encourages acts of kindness among students and the broader community.\n\nOverall, the AMDF is dedicated to fostering a supportive environment for women and children, promoting healing, empowerment, and community resilience against violence.
