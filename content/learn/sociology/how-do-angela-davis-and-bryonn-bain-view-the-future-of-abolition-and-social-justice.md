    How do Angela Davis and Bryonn Bain view the future of abolition and social justice?
answer: >-
    Angela Davis and Bryonn Bain share a vision for the future of abolition and social justice that emphasizes the importance of collective struggle and the transformative power of art. Davis, a prominent figure in abolitionist activism, believes that we are currently witnessing a significant clash between outdated systems and emerging progressive forces. She argues that this moment presents an opportunity to challenge the prison industrial complex and advocate for economic, racial, and gender justice. Her work, including her recent book "Abolition: Politics, Practices, Promises, Vol. 1," reflects her long-standing commitment to building communities of struggle and raising awareness about the harms caused by oppressive systems.\n\nBain, as an artist and activist, complements Davis's vision by focusing on the role of creativity in social justice movements. He emphasizes the importance of voices from those directly impacted by the prison system, advocating for a reimagining of justice that includes the perspectives of formerly incarcerated individuals. Bain's multimedia projects, such as "Lyrics from Lockdown," highlight the narratives and experiences of those affected by systemic injustices, reinforcing the idea that art can be a powerful tool for activism and change.\n\nTogether, Davis and Bain envision a future where the arts play a crucial role in mobilizing communities, fostering hope, and inspiring action against injustice. They advocate for a holistic approach to abolition that not only addresses the immediate needs of marginalized communities but also seeks to transform societal structures through education, awareness, and creative expression.
