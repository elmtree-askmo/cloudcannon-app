    What distinguishes objective knowledge from subjective knowledge in quantitative and qualitative methodologies?
answer: >-
    The distinction between objective knowledge and subjective knowledge in quantitative and qualitative methodologies is rooted in their respective ontological and epistemological foundations.\n\n### Objective Knowledge\nObjective knowledge is associated with quantitative research methodologies. It is characterized by the following:\n\n1. **Ontology**: Quantitative research is grounded in positivism, which posits that reality is objective and can be measured. This means that researchers believe there is a single, knowable reality that exists independently of human perceptions.\n\n2. **Epistemology**: In quantitative research, knowledge is discovered through universal laws and empirical evidence. Researchers use numerical data and statistical analysis to identify patterns, relationships, and causal links. The aim is to produce findings that can be generalized across larger populations.\n\n3. **Data Collection**: Quantitative methods often involve structured data collection techniques such as surveys, experiments, and observational studies that yield numerical data. For example, a study measuring the impact of a new policy might use statistical methods to analyze survey responses from a large sample.\n\n### Subjective Knowledge\nSubjective knowledge, on the other hand, is central to qualitative research methodologies. It is characterized by:\n\n1. **Ontology**: Qualitative research is based on social constructivism, which views reality as subjective and constructed through human interactions and experiences. This perspective acknowledges that individuals may perceive and interpret the same reality differently based on their backgrounds and contexts.\n\n2. **Epistemology**: In qualitative research, knowledge is constructed through social processes and is often context-dependent. Researchers seek to understand the meanings and experiences of individuals, emphasizing the richness and complexity of human behavior.\n\n3. **Data Collection**: Qualitative methods involve unstructured or semi-structured data collection techniques such as interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. For instance, a qualitative study exploring the experiences of refugees would prioritize in-depth interviews to capture personal narratives and insights.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, objective knowledge in quantitative methodologies is focused on measurable, generalizable data that reflects an external reality, while subjective knowledge in qualitative methodologies emphasizes individual experiences and interpretations of reality. This distinction highlights the different approaches researchers take to understand social phenomena, with quantitative research seeking to quantify and analyze, and qualitative research aiming to explore and interpret.
