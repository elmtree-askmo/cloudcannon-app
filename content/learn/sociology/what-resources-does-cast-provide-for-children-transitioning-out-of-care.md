    What resources does CAST provide for children transitioning out of care?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) provides several resources and support programs for children and youth transitioning out of care, particularly those who are aging out of the system. Here are some key resources and services offered:\n\n1. **Continued Care and Support for Youth Program**: This program extends support to youth aged 18 to 21 who have been in care. It includes both financial and non-financial assistance to help them transition into independence.\n\n2. **Fostering Youth to Independence Program**: This initiative assists young adults aged 18-24 who have left foster care or are about to leave. It provides help with finding and paying for housing for up to 36 months, which is crucial for those at risk of homelessness.\n\n3. **Moratorium on Aging Out**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario implemented a moratorium to prevent youth from aging out of care, ensuring that they continue to receive necessary supports and services. This moratorium has been extended to provide ongoing assistance to those whose care arrangements are set to expire.\n\n4. **Independent Living Coordinators**: CAST employs independent living coordinators who help youth access services aimed at achieving self-sufficiency before they exit care. These coordinators play a vital role in preparing youth for adulthood.\n\n5. **Mental Health Resources**: CAST also connects youth with mental health resources, including treatment locators and support services tailored to their needs.\n\n6. **Community Involvement**: CAST emphasizes the importance of community support and involvement in the transition process, helping youth build connections and networks that can aid their independence.\n\nThese resources are designed to address the unique challenges faced by youth transitioning out of care, ensuring they have the support needed to navigate adulthood successfully.
