    What are the public reactions and protests in India regarding the Gaza conflict?
answer: >-
    Public reactions and protests in India regarding the Gaza conflict have been significant, particularly in the wake of the escalation that began on October 7, 2023. The conflict has sparked widespread outrage among various segments of the Indian population, leading to protests in multiple cities.\n\nOne of the most notable demonstrations occurred on October 26, 2023, in Kozhikode, Kerala, where over 200,000 people participated in a solidarity march to support the Palestinian cause. This event was organized by the Indian Union Muslim League, reflecting the strong historical connections and support for Palestine in the region. Kerala has a long-standing tradition of activism related to global issues, and the Palestine issue is particularly resonant there due to its political landscape, which includes unambiguous support from major parties like the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n\nIn addition to Kerala, protests have erupted in other parts of India, including Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, and Lucknow, often coinciding with Friday prayers. These protests have been met with a mixed response from authorities, who have largely curtailed public demonstrations expressing solidarity with Palestinians, citing the need to maintain communal harmony.\n\nThe Indian government's official stance has been complex, as it condemned the initial Hamas attack while also urging for the protection of civilian lives in Gaza. This nuanced position reflects India's historical ties with Palestine and its growing strategic relationship with Israel. However, the public sentiment has often leaned towards supporting the Palestinian cause, especially in light of reports of civilian casualties in Gaza, which have further fueled protests and public outcry.\n\nOverall, the Gaza conflict has ignited a wave of activism in India, highlighting the deep-seated sentiments surrounding the issue and the varying responses from both the public and the government.
