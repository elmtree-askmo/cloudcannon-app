    What are the key phases of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process that involve public participation?
answer: >-
    The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process involves several key phases where public participation is crucial. These phases ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity to voice their concerns and contribute to the decision-making process. The key phases of the EIA process that involve public participation are:\n\n1. **Scoping**: This initial phase identifies the key issues and concerns that should be addressed in the assessment. Public meetings and consultations are often held to gather input from stakeholders, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered in determining the scope of the assessment.\n\n2. **Impact Assessment**: During this phase, the potential environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed project are evaluated. Stakeholders may be invited to provide feedback on the assessment methodologies and the significance of the identified impacts.\n\n3. **Review**: After the impact assessment is completed, stakeholders are given the opportunity to review the findings. This phase allows for public comments and feedback on the assessment report, which can influence the final decisions regarding the project.\n\n4. **Decision-Making**: In this final phase, the input from stakeholders is considered in the decision-making process. The decision-makers must take into account the concerns raised by the public and how they may affect the project's approval or modification.\n\nThese phases highlight the importance of integrating public participation into the EIA process to ensure that the voices of affected individuals and groups are heard, ultimately leading to more informed and equitable decision-making.
