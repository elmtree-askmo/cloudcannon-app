    What are the future research directions in green travel behavior?
answer: >-
    Future research directions in green travel behavior can be categorized into three main aspects based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Specific Issues to Explore**: There is a need for further investigation into the consciousness factor affecting green travel behavior, particularly within the context of urban residents in China. This includes understanding the interaction and regulating effects of cultural factors on travel intentions. Additionally, exploring the motivation-behavior gap is crucial, as many individuals exhibit pro-environmental attitudes that do not translate into corresponding travel behaviors. Research should focus on identifying the external factors that moderate these behaviors and how they differ among individuals.\n\n2. **Extensions of Classical Models**: Future studies should aim to extend existing theoretical frameworks, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, to better capture the complexities of green travel intentions. This includes examining the overlaps and distinctions between responsible, civilized, and sustainable behaviors in travel. Researchers should also consider the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental sustainability, as these factors can significantly influence travel behavior.\n\n3. **Methodological Innovations**: There is a call for innovative research methodologies in transportation studies, including systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses to map the trends in pro-environmental travel behavior research. This can help identify gaps in the literature and guide future inquiries. Additionally, employing mixed-method approaches that combine qualitative and quantitative data could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing green travel intentions.\n\nOverall, addressing these areas will not only enhance the theoretical understanding of green travel behavior but also inform policy recommendations aimed at promoting sustainable travel practices.
