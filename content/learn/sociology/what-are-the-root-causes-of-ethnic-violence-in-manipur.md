    What are the root causes of ethnic violence in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The root causes of ethnic violence in Manipur are deeply rooted in historical, social, and political factors, primarily revolving around the rivalry between the Meitei majority and the Kuki-Zo tribes. Here are the key elements contributing to the ongoing conflict:\n\n1. **Ethnic Composition and Historical Context**: Manipur is home to a diverse population, with the Meitei community, predominantly Hindu, making up about 53% of the population, while the Kuki-Zo tribes, who are mainly Christian, constitute around 16%. The historical context of the region, particularly the merger of Manipur with India in 1949, has laid the groundwork for ethnic tensions. The opposition to this merger has fueled resistance and separatist movements over the decades.\n\n2. **Competition for Resources and Political Representation**: The Meiteis and Kukis have historically competed for political representation, resources, and cultural recognition. The Meitei community predominantly resides in the Imphal Valley, while the Kuki-Zo tribes inhabit the hilly regions. This geographical separation has exacerbated misunderstandings and animosities between the two groups.\n\n3. **Government Policies and Grievances**: The state government's policies have often been perceived as favoring the Meitei community, leading to feelings of marginalization among the Kuki-Zo tribes. For instance, recent government actions to expel illegal immigrants from Myanmar and the demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei community have been viewed as attempts to undermine the rights and status of the Kuki-Zo tribes.\n\n4. **Violence and Human Rights Violations**: The violence that erupted in May 2023 has resulted in significant casualties and displacement, with reports indicating that over 220 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. Incidents of mob violence, including the brutal treatment of Kuki women, have further inflamed tensions and highlighted the deep-seated animosities.\n\n5. **External Influences and Conspiracies**: There are claims of external influences, including foreign conspiracies aimed at destabilizing the region. The Chief Minister of Manipur has suggested that misunderstandings and vested interests have contributed to the violence, indicating a complex interplay of local and international factors.\n\n6. **Lack of Democratic Space**: The denial of a democratic space for various ethnic communities in Manipur has been cited as a fundamental issue. The lack of effective representation and dialogue has perpetuated grievances and fueled the cycle of violence.\n\nIn summary, the ethnic violence in Manipur is a multifaceted issue stemming from historical grievances, competition for resources, government policies perceived as discriminatory, and a lack of effective political representation. Addressing these root causes is essential for achieving lasting peace and stability in the region.
