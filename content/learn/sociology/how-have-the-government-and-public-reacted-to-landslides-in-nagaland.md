    How have the government and public reacted to landslides in Nagaland?
answer: >-
    The response to the recent landslides in Nagaland has highlighted significant challenges in the state's disaster preparedness and management systems. The landslides, particularly affecting National Highway 29, have resulted in tragic loss of life and extensive damage to property, with over 50,000 families and 550 villages reported to be affected and displaced due to the ongoing monsoon rains.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, the Nagaland government, led by Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, convened high-level meetings to address the crisis. The state disaster response force (SDRF) has been actively involved in rescue operations, retrieving bodies from the debris and working alongside national agencies to provide relief. However, the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed available resources, and rescue operations have been hampered by difficult terrain.\n\nPublic reaction has been mixed; while there is a sense of urgency and concern, many residents have flocked to fuel outlets and shops selling essential items in anticipation of further disruptions. The Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority (NSDMA) has urged the public to exercise caution as the risk of additional landslides and flooding remains high.\n\nMoreover, an inter-ministerial central team has been dispatched to assess the damage caused by the monsoon, indicating a collaborative effort between state and central authorities to address both immediate needs and long-term infrastructure planning to mitigate future risks. The economic impact of the landslides has also been severe, with farmers losing crops and livelihoods, underscoring the urgent need for community resilience and effective disaster management strategies in the region.\n\nOverall, while the government has taken steps to respond to the crisis, the situation serves as a wake-up call for both authorities and local communities regarding the need for improved disaster preparedness and infrastructure development to minimize the impact of such natural disasters in the future.
