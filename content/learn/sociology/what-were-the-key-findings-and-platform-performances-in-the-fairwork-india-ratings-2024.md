    What were the key findings and platform performances in the Fairwork India Ratings 2024?
answer: >-
    The Fairwork India Ratings 2024, released on October 8, 2024, provide a comprehensive analysis of the working conditions of platform workers in India's gig economy. This report is the sixth consecutive annual study conducted by the Fairwork India Team in collaboration with Oxford University. \n\nKey findings from the report indicate that no platform scored above 6 out of 10, highlighting significant gaps in adherence to essential labor standards. The platforms evaluated include prominent aggregators such as BigBasket, Swiggy, Urban Company, and Zomato, all of which received a score of 6 out of 10. This score reflects ongoing challenges within the gig economy, particularly concerning low wages and unstable earnings. Many platforms fail to ensure that workers receive a local living wage after accounting for work-related costs.\n\nThe report emphasizes the need for improvement in fair pay and worker representation, indicating that many aggregators remain non-committal to enhancing the working conditions of their employees. The Fairwork framework used in the ratings serves as a global benchmark for assessing labor standards in the platform economy, underscoring the importance of addressing these issues to support the rapidly growing app-based workforce in India. \n\nOverall, the Fairwork India Ratings 2024 reveal critical insights into the labor standards within the platform economy, calling for urgent reforms to improve the conditions for gig workers.
