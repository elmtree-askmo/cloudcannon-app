    What movements exist to replace Columbus Day with alternative celebrations?
answer: >-
    A significant movement has emerged in recent decades to replace Columbus Day with alternative celebrations, primarily focusing on Indigenous Peoples Day. This movement began gaining traction in the 1990s, driven by advocacy from Native American activists who sought to challenge the traditional narrative surrounding Columbus and his legacy.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Day is intended to honor the culture and history of Indigenous communities in the Americas, both before and after Columbus's arrival. The first notable proposal for this alternative holiday was made in Berkeley, California, in 1992. However, it gained wider recognition and adoption starting in 2014, as more cities and states began to acknowledge the need for a more inclusive celebration that reflects the experiences and histories of Native peoples.\n\nAs of now, many local governments and over 100 cities have adopted Indigenous Peoples Day, with some states officially recognizing it instead of or in addition to Columbus Day. For instance, South Dakota was the first state to replace Columbus Day with Native Americans' Day, which is commonly referred to as Indigenous Peoples Day in other regions. This shift represents a broader reassessment of historical narratives and a questioning of the celebration of Columbus, who is often associated with the onset of European colonization and its accompanying violence against Indigenous populations.\n\nThe movement continues to grow, with educational initiatives aimed at rethinking how the history of Columbus and Indigenous peoples is taught in schools, further emphasizing the importance of recognizing and honoring Indigenous cultures and histories.
