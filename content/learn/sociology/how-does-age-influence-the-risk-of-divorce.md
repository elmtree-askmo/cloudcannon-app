    How does age influence the risk of divorce?
answer: >-
    Age significantly influences the risk of divorce, with various trends observed across different age groups. Here are some key points regarding how age affects divorce risk:\n\n1. **General Trend**: Divorce rates tend to decline with age. For both men and women, younger age groups exhibit higher divorce rates, while older individuals generally experience lower rates of divorce. This pattern has remained consistent over time.\n\n2. **Younger Age Groups**: Between 1990 and 2019, divorce rates decreased for men aged 15 to 44 and women aged 15 to 24. The most notable decline was among 15- to 24-year-olds, whose divorce rates fell by 43%, from 47 to 27 per 1,000 marriages.\n\n3. **Older Age Groups**: Conversely, divorce rates have increased for individuals aged 45 and older. This trend is particularly evident among those aged 65 and older, where divorce rates have continued to rise as more baby boomers enter this age group.\n\n4. **Age at First Marriage**: The age at which individuals marry also plays a crucial role in divorce risk. Research indicates that marrying at an older age is associated with greater marital stability. For instance, the median age for women at their first divorce has increased from 27.7 in 1970 to 40.1 in 2020, while for men, it rose from 30.5 to 42.6 over the same period.\n\n5. **Impact of Age Gaps**: Marriages with significant age differences can also influence divorce risk. For example, women married to men who are three or more years older face a 38% increased risk of divorce.\n\n6. **Gray Divorce**: The phenomenon of "gray divorce," which refers to divorces occurring after the age of 50, has gained attention. While the rates of divorce among those aged 50 to 64 have stabilized since 2010, the rates for those aged 65 and older have continued to rise, indicating a shift in societal norms regarding marriage and divorce in later life.\n\nIn summary, age is a critical factor in divorce risk, with younger individuals facing higher rates of divorce, while older individuals tend to have more stable marriages. Additionally, the age at which individuals marry and the presence of age gaps in relationships further complicate the dynamics of marital stability.
