    How does CAST support kinship care arrangements?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) supports kinship care arrangements through a structured approach that emphasizes maintaining connections between children and their families, communities, and cultural identities. Kinship care is defined as a situation where a child or youth comes into the care of CAST and is placed with a relative or someone they know and trust, which helps them remain in a familiar environment.\n\nCAST offers two primary forms of kinship care:\n\n1. **Kinship Care**: This occurs when a child or youth is placed in the care of a kinship family after coming into the care of CAST. This arrangement is designed to support the child's emotional and social well-being by keeping them connected to their family and community.\n\n2. **Kinship Service**: In this scenario, the child or youth does not enter the care of CAST but is instead placed with a kinship family. This service allows families to maintain their roles and responsibilities while ensuring the child's safety and well-being.\n\nCAST has an in-house team dedicated to finding, assessing, and supporting kinship arrangements. This team includes Kinship Connections Workers who work closely with kinship caregivers to provide the necessary support and resources. The organization recognizes the unique needs of kinship care and aims to create policies that are inclusive and responsive to these needs.\n\nBy prioritizing kinship placements, CAST not only helps children maintain their familial bonds but also fosters a sense of stability and belonging, which is crucial for their development. The organization actively engages with kinship caregivers, offering them information, referrals, and support services to ensure the safety and well-being of the children in their care.\n\nIn summary, CAST's support for kinship care arrangements is multifaceted, focusing on maintaining family connections, providing dedicated resources, and ensuring that caregivers have the necessary support to foster a nurturing environment for children and youth.
