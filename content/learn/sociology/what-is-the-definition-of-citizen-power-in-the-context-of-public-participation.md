    What is the definition of citizen power in the context of public participation?
answer: >-
    In the context of public participation, **citizen power** is defined as the ability of individuals and communities to influence decision-making processes and assert their rights within governance structures. This concept emphasizes that citizens should have a meaningful say in the policies and projects that affect their lives, particularly those that have historically marginalized certain groups.\n\nCitizen power is crucial for enabling marginalized communities to advocate for their interests and hold decision-makers accountable. It encompasses the idea that effective public participation is not merely about involvement but also about transforming power dynamics to create a more inclusive governance structure. This transformation is essential for ensuring that all voices, especially those of marginalized individuals, are heard and considered in decision-making processes.\n\nMoreover, citizen power is closely linked to the **redistribution of power** in public participation. This redistribution involves changing the balance of power among different stakeholders, allowing those who have been excluded from political and economic processes to be deliberately included. By enhancing citizen power, public participation contributes to achieving more equitable and sustainable outcomes, promoting social equity and justice, and fostering a more just society. \n\nIn summary, citizen power is a fundamental aspect of public participation that seeks to empower individuals and communities, particularly those who have been historically marginalized, to engage actively in governance and decision-making processes.
