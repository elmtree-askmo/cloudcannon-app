    What motivated Sabu Varghese to transition from smuggling to forest protection?
answer: >-
    Sabu Varghese, also known as Kunjumon, transitioned from smuggling to forest protection due to a combination of personal transformation and a desire to contribute positively to his environment. Previously involved in illegal activities such as harvesting and selling Vayana bark (cinnamon tree bark) and sandalwood, Sabu was part of a smuggling gang that earned substantial income from these practices. However, in 1996, he and 23 other smugglers made a pivotal decision to cease their illegal activities and join efforts in forest protection.\n\nThis shift was motivated by a recognition of the importance of conserving the forests they once exploited. Sabu became a member of the Ex-Vayana Bark Collectors Eco Development Committee (EDC) in Thekkady, which aimed to promote sustainable practices and protect the flora and fauna of the Periyar Tiger Reserve. His dedication and fearless approach to conservation eventually earned him the prestigious Cricketers for Wildlife Conservation Service Award, highlighting his remarkable transformation from a forest exploiter to a dedicated protector.\n\nSabu's journey reflects a broader narrative of reformed poachers taking active roles in conservation, showcasing the potential for change and the importance of community involvement in environmental protection. His commitment to ending crime in the Periyar forest underscores his dedication to safeguarding the natural resources of the region.
