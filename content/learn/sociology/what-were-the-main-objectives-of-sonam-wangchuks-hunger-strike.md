    What were the main objectives of Sonam Wangchuk's hunger strike?
answer: >-
    Sonam Wangchuk, a prominent climate activist and innovator, recently undertook a 21-day hunger strike in Leh, Ladakh, with two main objectives. Firstly, he aimed to draw global attention to the rapid environmental degradation occurring in the region, often referred to as the "third pole" due to its significant glaciers and ecological importance. Secondly, he sought to pressure the Indian government to grant the people of Ladakh the legal authority to protect their natural resources and advocate for their rights.\n\nWangchuk's hunger strike was not only a protest for the immediate needs of the Ladakhi people, such as statehood and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which would provide them with greater autonomy and protection of their cultural and environmental heritage, but also a broader call for action against climate change. His efforts align with international environmental initiatives, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate issues on a global scale.
