    What were the recent clashes in Manipur about?
answer: >-
    The recent clashes in Manipur are rooted in longstanding ethnic tensions between the predominantly Hindu Meitei community and the mainly Christian Kuki-Zo community. The violence escalated significantly in May 2023, following a rally where Kuki and Naga tribes protested against the Meitei's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, which would grant them special benefits in education and government jobs. This demand has been a contentious issue, as it threatens to reduce the affirmative action quotas currently available to the Kuki and Naga communities.\n\nSince the onset of the violence, at least 150 people have been killed, and thousands have been displaced, with many seeking refuge in army camps. The situation has been exacerbated by a curfew and internet shutdowns imposed by the government to control the unrest. Reports indicate that the violence has involved brutal attacks, including the tragic incident where two Kuki women were paraded naked and assaulted, which sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\nThe conflict is further complicated by historical grievances, with the Meitei community, which constitutes about 53% of Manipur's population, primarily residing in the valley around the capital, Imphal, while the Kuki-Zo community lives in the hill districts. The tensions have been inflamed by recent government actions, such as the expulsion of illegal immigrants from Myanmar and the reclassification of certain ancestral lands, which the Kuki community views as an encroachment on their rights.\n\nIn summary, the clashes in Manipur are a manifestation of deep-seated ethnic rivalries, socio-economic disparities, and political maneuvering, with the potential for further violence if not addressed through dialogue and reconciliation efforts.
