    What reactions have there been to the USCIRF report on India?
answer: >-
    The reactions to the USCIRF (United States Commission on International Religious Freedom) report on India have been notably polarized. The 2024 report highlighted severe violations of religious freedom in India, including incidents of violence, arbitrary arrests of religious leaders, and the demolition of homes and places of worship. It recommended that India be designated as a "Country of Particular Concern" (CPC) due to these ongoing issues.\n\nIn response, the Indian government has categorically rejected the USCIRF report, labeling the organization as biased and accusing it of having a political agenda. Officials have criticized the report for what they perceive as a misrepresentation of the situation regarding religious freedom in India.\n\nThe USCIRF's findings have drawn attention from various human rights advocates and organizations, who support the commission's recommendations and emphasize the need for international scrutiny of India's religious freedom conditions. USCIRF Vice Chair Abraham Cooper has urged the U.S. government to take further steps to support freedom of religion globally, reflecting a broader concern about the state of religious freedom not only in India but also in other countries identified in the report.\n\nOverall, the reactions to the USCIRF report illustrate a significant divide between the Indian government's stance and the perspectives of international human rights organizations, highlighting ongoing tensions regarding religious freedom in the country.
