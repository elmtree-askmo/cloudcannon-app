    Who are the key movements and figures in anti-carceral and abolition feminism?
answer: >-
    Anti-carceral and abolition feminism is a significant movement within feminist theory and activism that critiques the reliance on punitive measures, such as incarceration, to address issues of violence against women. This movement has gained traction in recent years, particularly in response to the perceived punitive turn of the post-2017 #MeToo movement. Key figures and movements within this framework include:\n\n1. **Angela Y. Davis**: A prominent scholar-activist, Davis has been influential in condemning carceral feminism, which emphasizes incarceration as a solution to violence. She advocates for understanding how state mechanisms can mirror intimate partner violence and abuse, arguing that punitive measures often exacerbate the issues they aim to resolve.\n\n2. **Gina Dent, Erica R. Meiners, and Beth E. Richie**: These scholars collaborated with Davis on the book *Abolition. Feminism. Now.*, which discusses the intersections of feminism and abolitionist thought. They emphasize the need for feminist movements to adopt anti-carceral approaches and challenge the state's co-optation of women's anti-violence efforts.\n\n3. **INCITE!**: This grassroots organization in the United States has been pivotal in linking the rise of carceral feminisms to the state's appropriation of women's anti-violence movements. INCITE! advocates for a feminist approach that prioritizes community-based solutions over punitive measures.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: The roots of abolition feminism can be traced back to the organized women's rights movement, which was deeply intertwined with radical abolitionist efforts. Figures like Sarah and Angelina Grimke were early advocates who faced criticism for their activism against slavery and for women's rights.\n\n5. **Critique of Carceral Feminism**: The movement critiques carceral feminism, which is characterized as a strand of white, liberal-bourgeois feminism that emerged from the mainstream women's liberation movement. This critique highlights how such approaches often fail to address the systemic issues faced by marginalized communities.\n\nOverall, anti-carceral and abolition feminism seeks to reframe the conversation around violence against women by advocating for transformative justice and community-based solutions rather than reliance on the criminal justice system.
