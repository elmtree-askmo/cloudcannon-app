    How have the industry and government responded to sexual harassment in the Kannada film industry?
answer: >-
    The Kannada film industry has been facing increasing scrutiny regarding sexual harassment, prompting both industry professionals and government bodies to take action. In recent developments, the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) convened meetings with women artists to address the rising cases of sexual abuse and harassment. These discussions, led by Karnataka Women's Commission Chairperson Nagalakshmi, aimed to formulate a consensus on the necessary steps to combat these issues.\n\nA significant response from the industry has been the collective call from over 150 film professionals urging the Karnataka government to establish a committee led by a retired judge to investigate sexual harassment cases within the industry. This initiative is supported by the Film Industry for Rights and Equality (FIRE), a collective advocating for a safer work environment. They have emphasized the need for a detailed inquiry into the rampant sexual harassment and have been instrumental in establishing Internal Complaints Committees (ICC) in the Kannada film industry over the past seven years.\n\nProminent figures in the industry, including actors like Kishore Kumar G, have publicly requested the government to take decisive action, highlighting that exploitation is prevalent across various sectors, not just in film. The #MeToo movement has also played a crucial role in bringing these issues to light, with women actors calling for a change in the mindset of influential producers and directors.\n\nIn summary, the response to sexual harassment in the Kannada film industry has involved a combination of grassroots advocacy from industry professionals, formal requests for government intervention, and the establishment of internal mechanisms to address complaints. The ongoing dialogue reflects a growing recognition of the need for systemic change to ensure a safe and equitable working environment for women in the industry.
