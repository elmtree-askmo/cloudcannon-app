    What age groups are most at risk for different types of maltreatment?
answer: >-
    The age groups most at risk for different types of maltreatment vary based on the type of abuse. Here are some key insights based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Physical Abuse**: Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable, with a significant number experiencing physical punishment and psychological violence. Specifically, six in ten children under 5 years of age are reported to suffer from such maltreatment.\n\n2. **Sexual Abuse**: The prevalence of sexual abuse is notable among children, with one in five women and one in seven men reporting having been sexually abused as children. This indicates that children of all ages are at risk, but the data does not specify a particular age group that is most affected.\n\n3. **Neglect**: Neglect is most commonly reported among children under 13 years old, with 84% of cases occurring in this age group. This suggests that younger children are at a higher risk of neglect compared to adolescents.\n\n4. **Emotional Abuse**: While specific age-related statistics for emotional abuse are not provided, it is generally understood that emotional maltreatment can occur at any age, particularly during formative years when children are developing their self-worth and emotional well-being.\n\n5. **Adolescents (Ages 12-17)**: This age group also experiences significant maltreatment, with prevalence rates ranging between 29% and 32%. However, the highest rates of maltreatment are consistently observed in the 5-to-11 age group, which ranges from 41% to 43%.\n\nIn summary, while children under 5 years old are at high risk for physical abuse, neglect predominantly affects those under 13, and adolescents also face considerable risks of maltreatment. Each type of maltreatment has its own age-related vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for targeted prevention and intervention strategies across different age groups.
