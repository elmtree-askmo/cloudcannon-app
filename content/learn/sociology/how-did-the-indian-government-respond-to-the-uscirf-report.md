    How did the Indian government respond to the USCIRF report?
answer: >-
    The Indian government responded strongly to the 2024 report released by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which criticized the state of religious freedom in India. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) labeled the USCIRF as a "biased organization with a political agenda," rejecting the findings of the report. The MEA spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, stated that the USCIRF continues to publish what he described as "anti-India propaganda" under the guise of its annual report.\n\nThe USCIRF's 2024 report recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a "Country of Particular Concern" (CPC) due to alleged severe violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief. The report highlighted incidents of violence, including killings and lynchings by vigilante groups, arbitrary arrests of religious leaders, and the demolition of homes and places of worship. In response, the Indian government emphasized that the report was not reflective of the actual situation in the country and criticized the USCIRF for its perceived bias and political motivations.
