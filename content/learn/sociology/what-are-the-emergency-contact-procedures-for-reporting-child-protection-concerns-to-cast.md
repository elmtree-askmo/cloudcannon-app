    What are the emergency contact procedures for reporting child protection concerns to CAST?
answer: >-
    To report child protection concerns to the Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST), you can follow these emergency contact procedures:\n\n1. **Contact Information**: You can reach CAST by calling 416-924-4646 or toll-free at 1-866-527-0833. These lines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n2. **Speaking to a Child Protection Worker**: When you call, you will be connected to a Child Protection Worker who will listen to your concerns. They will assess the situation to determine if a response is required and what type of response is appropriate.\n\n3. **Mandatory Reporting**: Under the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, anyone who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be in need of protection is legally required to report their concerns to a children's aid society. It is important to report even if you are not certain that abuse or neglect is occurring.\n\n4. **Immediate Danger**: If the report suggests that a child or youth has been harmed or is in immediate danger, a protection worker may respond within 12 hours of receiving the report.\n\n5. **Confidentiality**: Reports can be made confidentially, and it is not necessary to provide your personal information when making a report.\n\nFor further inquiries or non-emergency situations, you can contact CAST's general inquiries line at 416-924-4640. \n\nRemember, if you suspect a child is being harmed or is in danger, it is crucial to act promptly and report your concerns.
