    What are some examples of two-mode networks?
answer: >-
    Two-mode networks, also known as bipartite networks or affiliation networks, consist of two distinct sets of nodes where connections (or edges) only occur between nodes from different sets. Here are some examples of two-mode networks:\n\n1. **Membership in Institutions**: This can include individuals (e.g., students, employees) and the institutions they belong to (e.g., schools, companies). For instance, students are connected to the courses they are enrolled in.\n\n2. **Authors and Papers**: In academic contexts, authors can be linked to the papers they have written. This creates a two-mode network where one set consists of authors and the other set consists of research papers.\n\n3. **Users and Topics in Online Forums**: In online discussion platforms, users (node set 1) can post messages to various topics or threads (node set 2). The connections represent the participation of users in discussions about specific topics.\n\n4. **Co-offending Networks**: In criminology, individuals can be linked to the crimes they have committed together. This forms a two-mode network where one set consists of individuals and the other set consists of crimes.\n\n5. **Events and Participants**: In social events, participants can be linked to the events they attend. This creates a network where one set consists of individuals and the other set consists of events.\n\n6. **Interlocking Directorates**: In corporate governance, directors can be linked to the boards they serve on. This forms a two-mode network where one set consists of directors and the other set consists of corporate boards.\n\nThese examples illustrate the versatility of two-mode networks in representing various social, academic, and organizational relationships.
