    What are the current estimates of the undocumented immigrant population in Texas?
answer: >-
    As of 2023, the estimated population of undocumented immigrants in Texas is approximately 1.6 million. This figure has remained relatively stable over recent years, making Texas the state with the second-highest undocumented population in the United States, following California, which has an estimated 1.9 million unauthorized immigrants. \n\nIn the broader context, the total undocumented immigrant population in the United States was estimated to be around 11.7 million in July 2023, reflecting an increase of about 800,000 compared to the previous year. This overall figure is still below the peak of 12 million reached in 2008. \n\nIn Texas, undocumented immigrants represent about 8% of the state's workforce, highlighting their significant role in the local economy. The foreign-born share of the population in Texas was reported to be 17.9% in 2023, which is higher than the national average of 14.3%. \n\nThese statistics underscore the importance of understanding the demographic and economic contributions of undocumented workers in Texas, as well as the ongoing trends in immigration within the state.
