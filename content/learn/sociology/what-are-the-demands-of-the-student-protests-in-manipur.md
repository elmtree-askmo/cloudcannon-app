    What are the demands of the student protests in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The recent student protests in Manipur have emerged in response to escalating violence and law and order issues in the region, particularly linked to ethnic tensions between the Kuki and Meitei communities. The protests have been marked by demands for action against external threats, including drone and missile attacks that have heightened security concerns.\n\nStudent leader Ch Victor Singh has stated that the protesters have presented a list of six demands to Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya, with a 24-hour deadline for a response. Key demands include:\n\n1. The removal of the top police official in the state and the security adviser due to their perceived failure to control the ongoing violence.\n2. Restoration of peace in the strife-torn state, which has seen significant unrest since May 2023, resulting in numerous casualties and displacements.\n3. Addressing the broader issues of ethnic violence that have plagued the region for over a year.\n\nThe protests have led to significant unrest, with students clashing with security forces, resulting in injuries and the imposition of curfews and internet shutdowns in various districts to maintain order. The situation remains tense as students continue to advocate for their demands amidst ongoing violence in the state.
