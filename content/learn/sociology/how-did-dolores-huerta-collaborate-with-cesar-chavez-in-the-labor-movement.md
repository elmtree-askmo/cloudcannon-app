    How did Dolores Huerta collaborate with Cesar Chavez in the labor movement?
answer: >-
    Dolores Huerta collaborated closely with César Chávez in the labor movement, playing a pivotal role in the founding and development of the United Farm Workers (UFW). Together, they co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in 1962, which later evolved into the UFW. This partnership was instrumental in organizing farm workers to advocate for better wages, working conditions, and labor rights.\n\nHuerta was not only a co-founder but also a key strategist and negotiator. She helped organize significant events, such as the Delano grape strike in 1965, which was a major labor action aimed at improving conditions for farm workers in California. Huerta served as the lead negotiator for the workers' contract that emerged from this strike, showcasing her leadership and commitment to the cause.\n\nTheir collaboration was characterized by a shared vision of social justice and labor rights, and they worked tirelessly to mobilize thousands of laborers. Together, they fought against agribusiness interests and sought to empower farm workers through unionization and collective bargaining. Their efforts were part of a broader civil rights movement, and they became iconic figures in the struggle for labor rights, particularly for Hispanic and Latino workers in the United States.\n\nHuerta's contributions, alongside Chávez, have left a lasting legacy in the labor movement, and she continues to be an influential advocate for social justice and workers' rights.
