answer: >-
    The Turtle Project is a significant fundraising initiative organized by the Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation (AMDF). Its primary purpose is to honor the memory of Anne Marie D'Amico, who tragically lost her life in the Yonge Street Van Attack, and to promote positive change in the community by raising awareness and funds to combat violence.\n\nThe Turtle Project is held annually on December 3rd, which is also Anne Marie's birthday. This event serves as the pinnacle fundraising event for the foundation, showcasing live entertainment and bringing together community members to celebrate Anne Marie's legacy. The funds raised during The Turtle Project are directed towards supporting the North York Women's Shelter (NYWS) and its initiatives, including the HER Campaign, which aims to enhance the shelter's facilities and services.\n\nIn summary, The Turtle Project operates as a celebration of inner strength and resilience, providing a platform for fundraising and awareness while commemorating the spirit of Anne Marie D'Amico.
