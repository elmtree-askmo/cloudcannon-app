    What is the concept of 'face' in impression management?
answer: >-
    The concept of 'face' in impression management is fundamentally tied to the social value that individuals claim for themselves in interactions with others. Erving Goffman, a prominent sociologist, introduced this idea in his work, particularly in "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life." In this context, 'face' refers to the positive social image that a person seeks to maintain during social interactions.\n\nSpecifically, 'face' can be defined as the positive social value a person effectively claims for themselves based on the line of action they present to others during a particular encounter. This notion emphasizes the importance of self-presentation and the strategies individuals employ to manage how they are perceived by others. The process of managing one's 'face' involves various communicative behaviors and strategies, collectively referred to as facework. Facework is crucial for navigating social expectations and maintaining one's desired self-image, especially in interpersonal and organizational contexts.\n\nIn summary, 'face' is a metaphorical representation of an individual's social identity, and managing it is essential for successful social interactions. The concept underscores the interplay between personal self-conception and the need to conform to societal norms and expectations.
