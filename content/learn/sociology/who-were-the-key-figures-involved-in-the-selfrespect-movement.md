answer: >-
    The Self-Respect Movement, founded in 1925 by E. V. Ramasamy Naicker, commonly known as Periyar, was a significant social reform movement in South India aimed at achieving social equality and self-respect for those oppressed by the Indian caste system. Key figures involved in this movement include:\n\n1. **E. V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar)**: He is the founder and the most prominent leader of the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar challenged the cultural and political dominance of the Brahminical order and advocated for a distinct Dravidian identity. He is often referred to as the "Father of the Dravidian Movement" and is celebrated for his radical views on gender equality and social justice.\n\n2. **Gora (Goparaju Ramachandra Rao)**: An important figure in the movement, Gora later became known for his contributions to atheism and social reform. His involvement helped to broaden the movement's appeal and impact.\n\n3. **Veeramal and Annai Meenambal**: These two women activists played crucial roles as female leaders within the movement. They were known for their relentless advocacy for women's rights and their efforts to promote the movement's ideals among women.\n\nThe Self-Respect Movement was not only anti-caste but also embraced feminist values, actively promoting women's rights and challenging traditional gender roles. Periyar's vision and leadership significantly influenced the socio-political landscape of Tamil Nadu and beyond, making the movement a cornerstone of the anti-caste and non-Brahmin social movements in India.
