    What are the most recent landslides in Nagaland and their causes?
answer: >-
    Recent landslides in Nagaland have been significant and tragic, with multiple incidents reported in 2023. One of the most notable events occurred on July 4, 2023, when massive boulders rolled down a hill in Chumoukedima district, crushing three cars and resulting in the deaths of at least two individuals. This incident was exacerbated by heavy rainfall, which is a common trigger for landslides in the region.\n\nAnother serious landslide event occurred on September 3, 2024, along National Highway 29, where incessant rainfall led to a series of landslides that killed six people and injured several others. The landslides disrupted traffic between Dimapur and Kohima, highlighting the vulnerability of infrastructure in the area.\n\nThe causes of these landslides are multifaceted. Natural factors include the region's hilly terrain and the lithology of the rocks and soil, which can be affected by rainfall infiltration. However, human activities have significantly contributed to the problem. Deforestation, unplanned urbanization, and improper construction methods have weakened soil structures, making the area more susceptible to landslides. Large areas of forest have been cleared for agriculture and road construction, further increasing the risk.\n\nIn summary, the recent landslides in Nagaland have been primarily triggered by heavy rainfall, compounded by human-induced factors such as deforestation and poor urban planning. These incidents underscore the need for better land management practices and disaster preparedness in the region.
