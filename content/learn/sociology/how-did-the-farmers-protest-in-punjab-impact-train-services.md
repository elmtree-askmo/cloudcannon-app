    How did the farmers' protest in Punjab impact train services?
answer: >-
    The farmers' protest in Punjab significantly impacted train services, particularly through the Ambala and Ferozepur railway divisions. During the protests, farmers organized a 'rail roko' (rail blockade) that led to substantial disruptions in rail traffic. For instance, on specific protest days, train services were severely affected, with reports indicating that at least 376 passenger trains were cancelled, 89 were short-terminated, and 46 trains were altered in their routes.\n\nThe protests involved farmers squatting on train tracks at various locations, including Moga, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Tarn Taran, Sangrur, Patiala, Ferozepur, Bathinda, and Amritsar. This led to delays for several key trains, such as the Chandigarh-New Delhi Shatabdi Express, which was delayed by four hours, and the Vande Bharat train, which also experienced significant delays.\n\nOverall, the farmers' protests not only caused cancellations and delays but also stranded passengers at various stations, highlighting the widespread impact of the protests on rail services in the region.
