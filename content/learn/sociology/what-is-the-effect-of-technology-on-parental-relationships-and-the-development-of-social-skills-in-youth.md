    The impact of technology on parental relationships and the development of social skills in youth is multifaceted, encompassing both positive and negative effects.\n\n### Impact on Parental Relationships\n\n1. **Disruption of Family Dynamics**: The use of technology, particularly smartphones, can disrupt family harmony and reduce cohesiveness. Parents often find themselves distracted by their devices, leading to diminished verbal and nonverbal interactions with their children. This distraction can negatively affect the emotional state of parents and the quality of parent-child interactions (Ingram, 2020).\n\n2. **Digital Parenting Awareness**: The infusion of digital technologies into family life has reshaped parent-child relationships. Research indicates that the time parents spend with their children, when combined with an awareness of digital parenting, can influence the quality of these relationships. Parents who are mindful of their technology use may foster stronger connections with their children (Hiniker et al., 2016).\n\n3. **Sharenting**: An emerging concern is "sharenting," where parents share photos or stories about their children on social media without their consent. This practice can lead to privacy issues and may affect the trust between parents and children (Hiniker et al., 2016).\n\n### Development of Social Skills in Youth\n\n1. **New Platforms for Social Interaction**: Contrary to the belief that technology undermines social skills, some studies suggest that screen-based technologies provide new platforms for children to seek autonomy from parents, develop group norms, and build identities. These platforms can facilitate the formation and maintenance of friendships, allowing youth to interact with diverse peer groups (Downey & Gibbs, 2020).\n\n2. **Social Skills and Emotional Learning**: The relationship between technology use and social skills is complex. While excessive screen time can lead to declines in social skills, particularly in youth with social anxiety, technology can also serve as a tool for social-emotional learning. It can help youth express feelings positively and navigate social interactions (American Journal of Sociology, 2020).\n\n3. **Age and Developmental Factors**: The effects of technology on social skills can vary depending on the age of the child. For instance, early adolescents are particularly susceptible to social pressures and peer comparisons, which can be exacerbated by social media use. This age group may experience heightened emotional sensitivity due to the interactive nature of social media (Nesi et al., 2017).\n\n4. **Potential Risks**: Increased social media use has been linked to negative outcomes such as poor mental health, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. Adolescents who spend more than three hours per day on social media are at a higher risk for these issues, which can further impact their social skills and relationships (American Journal of Sociology, 2020).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, technology has a dual impact on parental relationships and the development of social skills in youth. While it can disrupt family dynamics and pose risks to social skills, it also offers new avenues for interaction and emotional learning. The key lies in balancing technology use and fostering awareness among parents and youth to mitigate potential negative effects while harnessing the benefits of digital platforms.
