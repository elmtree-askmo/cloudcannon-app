    What future directions are being considered to address sexual harassment in the Kannada film industry?
answer: >-
    To address sexual harassment in the Kannada film industry, several future directions are being considered, primarily focusing on the establishment of formal committees and action plans. Here are the key initiatives:\n\n1. **Formation of a Committee**: The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) has been called upon to create an action plan to establish a committee under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Act. This committee would be responsible for addressing sexual harassment issues within the industry. If the KFCC cannot form such a committee, they are required to provide justifications for this inability.\n\n2. **Independent Oversight**: Over 100 film professionals have urged the Karnataka government to appoint a committee led by a retired judge. This committee would investigate and report on the issues faced by women in the industry, including sexual harassment. This move aims to ensure an impartial and thorough examination of the concerns raised.\n\n3. **Advocacy by FIRE**: The organization Film Industry For Rights and Equality (FIRE), which has been active since 2017, is advocating for the formation of a dedicated committee to comprehensively address sexual harassment. FIRE has already played a significant role in establishing India's first Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) within the Kannada film industry.\n\n4. **Karnataka Women's Commission Initiatives**: The Karnataka State Women's Commission has proposed a 17-point agenda aimed at combating sexual harassment and exploitation in the industry. This agenda is expected to outline various measures to safeguard women's rights in the workplace.\n\n5. **Confidential Survey**: The Karnataka Women's Commission plans to conduct a confidential survey to assess the extent of sexual harassment faced by women in the Kannada film industry. This survey will help gather data and insights that can inform future policies and actions.\n\n6. **Cultural Change**: There is a growing recognition among women actors and industry stakeholders that a change in mindset is necessary among influential producers and directors. The #MeToo movement within the Kannada film industry has highlighted the need for establishing clear boundaries and fostering a safer work environment.\n\nThese initiatives reflect a concerted effort to create a safer and more equitable environment for women in the Kannada film industry, addressing both immediate concerns and long-term cultural changes.
