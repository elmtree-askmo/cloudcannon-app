    What are the common sources of bias in sampling?
answer: >-
    Sampling bias refers to the systematic error that occurs when certain members of a population are more likely to be selected for a study than others, leading to a sample that is not representative of the entire population. This can significantly affect the validity of research findings. Here are some common sources of bias in sampling:\n\n1. **Undercoverage Bias**: This occurs when certain groups within the population are inadequately represented in the sample. For example, if a survey primarily targets urban residents, rural populations may be underrepresented, leading to skewed results.\n\n2. **Self-Selection Bias**: Also known as non-response bias, this type of bias arises when individuals choose to participate in a study voluntarily. This can result in over-representation of those who have strong opinions or experiences related to the study topic, while those indifferent or less engaged may not respond.\n\n3. **Convenience Sampling**: This occurs when researchers select a sample based on ease of access rather than random selection. For instance, surveying people in a specific location (like a mall) may not accurately reflect the broader population.\n\n4. **Survivorship Bias**: This bias happens when only the "survivors" or successful cases are considered, ignoring those that did not succeed or were lost. This can lead to overly optimistic conclusions about a phenomenon.\n\n5. **Quota Sampling**: In this method, researchers set quotas for certain demographic groups to ensure representation. However, if the selection within those quotas is not random, it can introduce bias.\n\n6. **Selection Bias**: This broader category includes any systematic differences between the sample and the population from which it is drawn. It can occur in both probability and non-probability sampling methods.\n\nTo mitigate these biases, researchers can employ strategies such as random sampling, ensuring a well-defined target population, and using comprehensive sampling frames that accurately reflect the population. By addressing these common sources of bias, researchers can enhance the external validity of their studies and produce more reliable results.
