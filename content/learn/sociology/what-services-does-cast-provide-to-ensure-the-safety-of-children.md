answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) provides a range of services aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of children and youth, particularly those who are at risk of abuse or neglect. Here are the key services offered by CAST:\n\n1. **Protection Services**: CAST is mandated to protect children and youth from various forms of abuse, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. They investigate allegations of abuse and neglect to ensure the safety of children.\n\n2. **Foster Care**: When children cannot safely remain in their homes, CAST facilitates foster care placements. Foster parents provide a temporary, supportive, and stable environment for children and youth until they can return home or find a permanent solution.\n\n3. **Support for Families**: CAST works with parents and caregivers to build their capacity to provide safe environments for children. This includes offering resources and support to help families develop healthy relationships and improve their parenting skills.\n\n4. **Community Collaboration**: CAST collaborates with various community partners, including social services, law enforcement, and medical providers, to ensure a coordinated response to child protection cases. This collaboration helps in conducting thorough and timely investigations.\n\n5. **Ongoing Services**: In cases where ongoing support is necessary, CAST provides services aimed at helping families create a safe environment for children. This may include intervention with court orders when required for the child's safety.\n\n6. **Culturally Competent Services**: CAST emphasizes the importance of culturally aligned services, ensuring that the needs of diverse communities are met in a respectful and effective manner.\n\nThrough these services, CAST aims to create safe and nurturing environments for children and youth, helping them to grow and thrive despite challenging circumstances.
