    What is CarePortal and how does it function within the child welfare system?
answer: >-
    CarePortal is a technology platform designed to facilitate support for children and families in crisis, particularly those involved with the child welfare system. Launched in 2015 by The Global Orphan Project, CarePortal connects social service agencies with local churches, businesses, and community organizations to address the urgent needs of vulnerable children and families in real-time.\n\nThe platform operates by allowing local agencies to post specific needs—such as furniture for a family transitioning out of homelessness or urgent car repairs for a working parent—directly to a network of community responders. This approach eliminates the ambiguity often associated with traditional donation methods, enabling individuals and organizations to contribute directly to the needs of families in their area. \n\nCarePortal's mission is to enact community-based interventions that help families receive the support they need to care for their children effectively. By mobilizing local resources, CarePortal aims to strengthen families, support safe reunification, stabilize temporary foster and kinship placements, and accelerate the process of finding permanent homes for children in foster care. Since its inception, CarePortal has reportedly helped over 250,000 children avoid entering the foster care system and has generated significant economic impact across the states it operates in.\n\nThe platform is particularly focused on addressing the systemic issues within the child welfare system, such as the high percentage of cases stemming from neglect related to poverty. By fostering collaboration among various community stakeholders, CarePortal seeks to remove barriers to effective child welfare and create a more supportive environment for families in need. \n\nIn summary, CarePortal serves as a vital link between the child welfare system and community resources, promoting a proactive approach to child welfare that emphasizes local involvement and support.
