    How engaged is the public and government in India with LGBTQIA+ rights?
answer: >-
    The engagement of the public and government in India with LGBTQIA+ rights has evolved significantly over the years, marked by both legal advancements and ongoing societal challenges.\n\nHistorically, the LGBTQIA+ community in India faced substantial discrimination and legal hurdles. The early activism began in the 1990s, with notable events such as the first All-India Hijra Conference in 1981 and the publication of "Less Than Gay" by the AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan (ABVA) in 1991, which highlighted the status of LGBTQIA+ individuals and called for legal reforms.\n\nIn recent years, there have been notable legal milestones. The decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults in 2018, following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, marked a significant victory for LGBTQIA+ rights. Additionally, the 2014 National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) ruling recognized hijras and transgender individuals as a 'third gender,' affirming their rights under the Constitution.\n\nThe government has also shown a willingness to engage with LGBTQIA+ issues. For instance, the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment has sought public input to enhance inclusivity in policies for the LGBTQIA+ community, reflecting a proactive approach to addressing their needs. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has been involved in various landmark cases that have shaped the legal landscape for LGBTQIA+ rights, including the ongoing deliberations regarding marriage equality.\n\nDespite these advancements, societal acceptance remains a significant challenge. While legal recognition has improved, public attitudes towards same-sex relationships, marriage, and other forms of partnership are still largely conservative. The recent Supreme Court hearings on marriage equality, set to conclude in October 2023, highlight the ongoing struggle for full recognition and rights for LGBTQIA+ individuals in India.\n\nIn summary, while there has been considerable progress in legal recognition and government engagement with LGBTQIA+ rights in India, societal acceptance continues to lag, indicating a complex landscape where legal rights and public sentiment do not always align.
