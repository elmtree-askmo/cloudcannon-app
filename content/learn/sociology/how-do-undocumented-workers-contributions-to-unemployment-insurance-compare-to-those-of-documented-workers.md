    How do undocumented workers' contributions to unemployment insurance compare to those of documented workers?
answer: >-
    Undocumented workers contribute significantly to the unemployment insurance system, primarily through payroll taxes, yet they do not have access to the benefits that their contributions help fund. In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid approximately $1.8 billion in unemployment insurance taxes. This figure is part of a larger contribution of $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes and $6.4 billion in Medicare taxes made by undocumented workers that same year.\n\nEmployers of undocumented workers also contribute to unemployment insurance funds. On average, these employers pay about $1.3 billion nationwide into unemployment insurance funds annually. This contribution is crucial for the solvency of the unemployment insurance system, especially considering that undocumented workers are often excluded from receiving benefits despite their tax contributions.\n\nIn contrast, documented workers typically have access to the unemployment benefits that they fund through their contributions. This disparity highlights a significant inequity in the system, where undocumented workers contribute to programs from which they cannot benefit. For instance, while documented workers can receive unemployment benefits when they lose their jobs, undocumented workers, even if they have been paying into the system, are generally ineligible for such assistance.\n\nOverall, while both undocumented and documented workers contribute to unemployment insurance, the key difference lies in the access to benefits. Documented workers can claim unemployment benefits, whereas undocumented workers, despite their substantial contributions, are largely excluded from these safety nets. This situation raises important questions about the fairness and effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system and calls for potential reforms to address these inequities.
