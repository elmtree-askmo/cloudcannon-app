    How did Riis's work impact housing policies in urban areas?
answer: >-
    Jacob Riis's work had a profound impact on housing policies in urban areas, particularly through his groundbreaking book, *How the Other Half Lives*, published in 1890. In this work, Riis utilized powerful photography and vivid descriptions to expose the dire living conditions faced by the urban poor in New York City, particularly in overcrowded tenements. His detailed accounts of the squalid environments and the struggles of impoverished immigrants not only shocked the public but also galvanized reform efforts.\n\nRiis's advocacy highlighted the urgent need for housing reform, leading to increased pressure on local, state, and federal authorities to address the appalling conditions of tenement living. His work served as a catalyst for housing reformers, who, inspired by Riis's findings, began to push for new housing designs that would alleviate overcrowding and improve safety, sanitation, and access to light and air. This collective effort contributed to the establishment of more stringent building codes and regulations aimed at improving living conditions in urban areas.\n\nMoreover, Riis's emphasis on the connection between housing conditions and broader social issues, such as poverty and moral decay, helped to frame housing as a critical component of public health and social reform. His assertion that poor housing was a major source of societal ills resonated with reformers and policymakers, leading to a more comprehensive approach to urban planning and housing policy.\n\nIn summary, Jacob Riis's work not only raised public awareness about the harsh realities of tenement life but also played a crucial role in shaping housing policies that sought to improve the living conditions of the urban poor, ultimately contributing to the broader movement for social reform in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
