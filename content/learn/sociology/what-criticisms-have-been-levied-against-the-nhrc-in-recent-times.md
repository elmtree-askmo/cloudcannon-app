    What criticisms have been levied against the NHRC in recent times?
answer: >-
    Recent criticisms of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India have highlighted several significant concerns regarding its effectiveness and engagement with civil society. Here are some of the key points raised:\n\n1. **Lack of Engagement with Civil Society**: The NHRC has faced criticism for its perceived disengagement from civil society organizations. In an attempt to address this, the NHRC re-constituted its core group on NGOs and human rights organizations. However, critics argue that this move has not sufficiently improved its interaction with these groups.\n\n2. **Resource Limitations**: The NHRC is described as being short-staffed and inadequately funded, which hampers its ability to effectively address human rights violations. This situation has led to concerns about its operational capacity, with the NHRC's chairperson, former Chief Justice H.L. Dattu, famously referring to the commission as a "toothless tiger." This sentiment has been echoed by the Supreme Court, which has expressed similar concerns regarding the NHRC's effectiveness.\n\n3. **Decreased Activity**: Civil society groups have noted a significant reduction in the number of suo motu cases (cases taken up by the NHRC on its own initiative) being addressed by the commission. Reports indicate that this number has nearly halved, leading to perceptions that the NHRC is becoming a "silent spectator" in the face of ongoing human rights issues.\n\n4. **Concerns Over Autonomy**: As the NHRC marks its 28th anniversary, questions have been raised about its autonomy and the quality of its achievements. Critics point to less-than-stellar data regarding its performance and the potential erosion of its independence, which is crucial for a body tasked with safeguarding human rights.\n\n5. **International Accreditation Issues**: The NHRC's accreditation status has also come under scrutiny. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) had granted it 'A' status in 2017, but concerns about its functioning could jeopardize this status, affecting its ability to represent India at the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\n6. **Specific Cases of Human Rights Violations**: The NHRC has conducted inquiries into specific incidents, such as the Sandeshkhali case, where it identified barriers preventing individuals from voicing grievances due to fear of reprisal. Such findings underscore the challenges faced by the NHRC in effectively addressing human rights violations.\n\nIn summary, the NHRC is facing significant criticism regarding its operational effectiveness, engagement with civil society, resource constraints, and concerns about its autonomy and international standing. These issues highlight the need for reforms to enhance its capacity to protect and promote human rights in India.
