    What are the common forms of online harassment and their impact on individuals?
answer: >-
    Online harassment manifests in various forms, each with distinct characteristics and impacts on individuals. The most common forms include:\n\n1. **Hateful Speech and Threats**: This is the most prevalent type of online harassment, where individuals face explicit or implicit threats and derogatory comments targeting aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\n2. **Offensive Name-Calling and Embarrassment**: Many individuals report experiences of less severe harassment, such as offensive name-calling or attempts to embarrass them. For instance, 61% of those harassed on online forums encountered such behavior.\n\n3. **Cyberbullying**: This encompasses a range of behaviors, including:\n   - **Flaming**: Sending angry or rude messages.\n   - **Harassment**: Repeatedly sending insulting or threatening messages.\n   - **Cyberstalking**: Intimidation or threats of harm.\n   - **Denigration**: Spreading cruel rumors or put-downs.\n   - **Masquerading**: Pretending to be someone else to damage their reputation.\n   - **Outing**: Revealing personal information shared in confidence.\n   - **Exclusion**: Maliciously leaving someone out of online groups or discussions.\n\n4. **Social Media Harassment**: This type of harassment is particularly common on social media platforms, where individuals may face targeted attacks from both known and unknown users.\n\nThe impact of online harassment can be severe, leading to significant mental health consequences. Victims may experience anxiety, depression, and other psychosomatic symptoms such as headaches and sleeplessness. Research indicates that women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals are disproportionately affected, with studies showing that 57% of harassment victims in the U.S. are female.\n\nMoreover, online harassment can have broader societal implications, as it often aims to silence diverse voices and restrict freedom of expression. This creates an environment where individuals may feel compelled to withdraw from online spaces, further exacerbating issues of censorship and marginalization.\n\nIn summary, online harassment is a multifaceted issue that affects individuals across various demographics, with significant emotional and psychological repercussions. Understanding these forms and their impacts is crucial for addressing and mitigating the effects of online harassment in digital spaces.
