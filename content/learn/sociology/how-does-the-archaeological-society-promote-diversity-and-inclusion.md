    How does the Archaeological Society promote diversity and inclusion?
answer: >-
    The Archaeological Society promotes diversity and inclusion through a variety of initiatives and commitments aimed at addressing systemic issues within the field of archaeology. Here are some key ways in which the Society fosters these values:\n\n1. **Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**: The Society acknowledges the lack of diversity in archaeology and is actively working to increase DEI within its organization and the broader field. This commitment is reflected in their strategic plans and policy statements, which emphasize the importance of creating a more inclusive profession that better represents society.\n\n2. **Collaborative Initiatives**: The Society collaborates with various organizations, such as the Society of Black Archaeologists and the Indigenous Archaeology Collective, to collectively address and promote diversity in archaeology. These coalitions focus on developing strategies to move the discipline forward in terms of equity and inclusion.\n\n3. **Educational Programs and Resources**: The Society is dedicated to creating a welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds. This includes revising curricula to be more inclusive, offering scholarships for field schools, and providing resources that support diverse narratives in archaeological research.\n\n4. **Listening and Feedback Mechanisms**: The Archaeological Society has established listening groups to gather input on how to improve diversity and reduce discrimination within its departments and fieldwork. This approach emphasizes the importance of community feedback in shaping policies and practices.\n\n5. **Webinars and Training**: The Society organizes webinars that address issues of race, diversity, and inclusion in teaching archaeology. These sessions aim to equip educators with strategies to incorporate inclusive practices in their courses, thereby fostering a more diverse learning environment.\n\n6. **Public Statements and Resources**: The Society uses events like "A Day in Archaeology" to publicly commit to addressing DEI issues. They also maintain an Equality and Diversity Resources Hub on their website, which provides access to various resources related to these topics.\n\nThrough these efforts, the Archaeological Society aims to create a more equitable and inclusive field that not only reflects the diversity of society but also enriches the discipline of archaeology itself.
