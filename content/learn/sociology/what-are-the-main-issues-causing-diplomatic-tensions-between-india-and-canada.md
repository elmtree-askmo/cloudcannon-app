    What are the main issues causing diplomatic tensions between India and Canada?
answer: >-
    The diplomatic tensions between India and Canada have escalated significantly due to several key issues, primarily revolving around allegations of violence and political interference related to Sikh separatism.\n\n1. **Assassination Allegations**: The most critical flashpoint in the recent tensions was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation that the Indian government may have been involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader, on Canadian soil. This accusation has been described as a serious breach of diplomatic norms and has led to heightened scrutiny of India's actions in Canada.\n\n2. **Expulsion of Diplomats**: In response to these allegations, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, claiming that Indian government agents were involved in activities that threaten public safety, including homicides and intimidation of the Sikh diaspora. India retaliated by withdrawing its diplomats, marking a significant downturn in relations between the two countries.\n\n3. **Khalistan Movement**: The tensions are further exacerbated by India's concerns over the Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish a separate Sikh state. India perceives Canada's support for Sikh separatists as a direct threat to its national security. The Indian government has accused Canada of harboring pro-Khalistani elements, which it believes are involved in violent activities against India.\n\n4. **Political Context**: The political landscape in Canada, particularly under Trudeau's government, has been characterized by what India describes as "vote bank politics," where the Liberal Party's support from the Sikh community influences its stance on issues related to India. This has led to accusations from Indian officials that Canada is not adequately addressing India's concerns regarding Sikh extremism.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: The relationship between India and Canada has historically been cordial, but recent events have strained this rapport. Experts note that previous Canadian administrations had worked towards improving ties, but the current situation represents a significant regression, with both countries now facing a diplomatic crisis that could have broader geopolitical implications.\n\nIn summary, the main issues causing diplomatic tensions between India and Canada include serious allegations of state-sponsored violence, the expulsion of diplomats, concerns over the Khalistan movement, and the political dynamics within Canada that influence its foreign policy towards India. These factors have collectively contributed to a significant deterioration in bilateral relations.
