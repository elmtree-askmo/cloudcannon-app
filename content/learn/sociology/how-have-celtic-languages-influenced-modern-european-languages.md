    How have Celtic languages influenced modern European languages?
answer: >-
    Celtic languages have had a notable influence on modern European languages, particularly in the British Isles and parts of France and Spain. The primary Celtic languages today include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton, which are derived from Proto-Celtic, itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European. This linguistic lineage connects Celtic languages to a broader spectrum of European languages, allowing for various influences and exchanges.\n\n### Influence on English\nOne of the most significant impacts of Celtic languages is seen in the English language. As Irish and Scottish Gaelic speakers migrated to English-speaking regions, they brought with them vocabulary and expressions that have been integrated into English. For example:\n- The Irish word "craic" (meaning fun or enjoyment) has been adopted into English vernacular.\n- The toast "SlÃ¡inte," meaning good health, is commonly used in Irish pubs.\n- Other words like "galore" (from Irish "go leor," meaning enough) and "smithereens" (from "smidirini," meaning small fragments) illustrate the semantic borrowing from Irish into English.\n\n### Influence on Other Languages\nCeltic languages have also influenced other languages in Europe, particularly in regions where Celtic peoples historically resided. For instance:\n- **Welsh** has contributed to the vocabulary of English, especially in place names and terms related to local culture and geography.\n- **Breton**, spoken in Brittany, France, has influenced the French language in similar ways, particularly in regional dialects.\n\n### Cultural and Linguistic Identity\nThe spread of Celtic languages has facilitated the development of distinct linguistic identities in the regions where they are spoken. For example, the revival of the Irish language in the 19th and 20th centuries was closely tied to movements of romantic nationalism, which sought to reclaim and celebrate Irish identity and heritage. This cultural revival has also influenced modern literature and art, further embedding Celtic linguistic characteristics into contemporary European culture.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the influence of Celtic languages on modern European languages is multifaceted, encompassing vocabulary enrichment, cultural identity, and the preservation of linguistic heritage. The interactions between Celtic languages and neighboring languages have led to a rich tapestry of linguistic exchange that continues to shape the linguistic landscape of Europe today.
