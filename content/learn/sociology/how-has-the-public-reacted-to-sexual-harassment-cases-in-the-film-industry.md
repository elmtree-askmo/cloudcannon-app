    How has the public reacted to sexual harassment cases in the film industry?
answer: >-
    The public reaction to sexual harassment cases in the Indian film industry has been significant, particularly following the #MeToo movement that gained momentum in 2018. This movement served as a watershed moment, bringing to light the pervasive issues of sexual harassment and abuse within the industry, which had often been downplayed or ignored.\n\nInitially, the movement sparked widespread discussions in homes and social gatherings, highlighting the need for change. High-profile allegations emerged, with actresses like Sreelekha Mitra publicly accusing well-known figures in the industry, such as director Ranjith, of sexual harassment. This led to a broader acknowledgment of the systemic issues faced by women in the film industry, including poor working conditions and rampant harassment, particularly in regional cinema like Malayalam-language films.\n\nThe public response has been mixed but largely supportive of the victims. Many have praised the movement for its role in fostering a culture of accountability and pushing for the implementation of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act. The movement has also encouraged discussions about creating more inclusive workplaces for women, both in front of and behind the camera.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the impact of the #MeToo movement in India has been comparatively modest, with many cases still unresolved and a lack of substantial changes in industry practices. Despite this, the movement has undeniably triggered a reckoning, leading to increased scrutiny of male actors and industry leaders, and has encouraged more women to come forward with their experiences.\n\nOverall, the public reaction has been one of support for the victims and a call for systemic change, reflecting a growing awareness and intolerance of sexual harassment in the film industry.
