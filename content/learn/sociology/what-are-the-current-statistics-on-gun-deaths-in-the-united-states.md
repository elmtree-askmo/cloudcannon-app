    What are the current statistics on gun deaths in the United States?
answer: >-
    As of 2023, gun deaths in the United States have shown significant regional variation and trends. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the South has the highest number of gun deaths, totaling 22,654, with a gun death rate of 17.4 per 100,000 people. In contrast, the Northeast has lower rates of gun deaths.\n\nIn 2022, there were over 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S., averaging about 132 deaths per day. This figure includes a significant number of suicides, which accounted for more than half of all firearm-related deaths, while over 40% were homicides. The CDC's provisional data for 2023 indicates a continuing trend of gun violence, with a noted decline in overall gun deaths and homicides compared to previous years, although the rates of gun suicides remain a concern.\n\nIn 2021, the total number of firearm deaths was reported at 48,830, with suicides making up 54% and homicides 43% of these deaths. The per capita gun death rate in 2021 was 14.6 per 100,000 people, marking the highest rate since the early 1990s.\n\nOverall, while there have been fluctuations in gun death statistics, the data indicates persistent challenges related to gun violence, particularly in terms of suicides and disparities among different demographic groups.
