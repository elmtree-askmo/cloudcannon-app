    What was the Indian Residential School System, and what impact did it have?
answer: >-
    The Indian Residential School System (IRSS) was a network of boarding schools established in Canada, primarily from the late 19th century until the late 20th century, with the explicit goal of assimilating Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. The first of these schools, the Mohawk Institute, was founded in 1828, and the system was formalized through an amendment to the Indian Act in 1876. Over the course of its operation, more than 150,000 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children were forced to attend these institutions, which were often run by churches and funded by the Canadian government.\n\nThe IRSS was part of a broader colonial strategy aimed at addressing what was referred to as the "Indian question"—the perceived need to eliminate Indigenous cultures and integrate Indigenous peoples into mainstream Canadian society. The schools were located off-reserve, and children were often removed from their families for extended periods, sometimes living at the schools year-round. The curriculum was designed to eradicate Indigenous languages, cultural practices, and spiritual beliefs, replacing them with Western education and Christian values.\n\nThe impact of the Indian Residential School System has been profound and lasting. Many children experienced severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse while at these schools, leading to intergenerational trauma that continues to affect Indigenous communities today. The legacy of the IRSS is evident in high rates of unemployment, homelessness, and involvement in the justice system among Indigenous peoples, as well as a disconnection from cultural identity and community.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the harms caused by the IRSS, leading to calls for accountability, reconciliation, and healing. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, established in 2008, documented the experiences of survivors and made recommendations for addressing the ongoing impacts of the residential school system. The legacy of the IRSS remains a critical issue in discussions about Indigenous rights, cultural preservation, and social justice in Canada.
