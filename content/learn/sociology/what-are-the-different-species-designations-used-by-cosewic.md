    What are the different species designations used by COSEWIC?
answer: >-
    The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) uses several species designations to classify the status of wildlife species that are considered to be at risk in Canada. These designations are based on assessments of the species' population status, threats, and distribution. The main categories of species designations used by COSEWIC are:\n\n1. **Extinct**: A species that no longer exists anywhere in the world.\n2. **Extirpated**: A species that no longer exists in the wild in Canada but still exists elsewhere.\n3. **Endangered**: A species that is facing imminent extirpation or extinction.\n4. **Threatened**: A species that is likely to become endangered if nothing is done to reverse the factors leading to its decline.\n5. **Special Concern**: A species that may become threatened or endangered because of a combination of factors.\n\nAdditionally, COSEWIC also recognizes a category for species that are **Not at Risk**, which indicates that a species is not currently facing any significant threats to its survival. There is also a category for **Data Deficient**, which is used when there is insufficient information to assess the risk of extinction for a species.\n\nThese designations are crucial for informing conservation efforts and guiding the management of wildlife species in Canada. COSEWIC regularly updates its assessments and status reports to reflect changes in species populations and threats.
