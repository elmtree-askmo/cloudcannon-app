    What are the current statistics on the prevalence of domestic violence and which demographics are most affected?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, current statistics indicate that over 4 million women in the U.S. experience severe assaults by partners annually. This highlights a significant prevalence of domestic violence, underscoring the urgent need for awareness and intervention.\n\nWhile the gathered information does not provide specific demographic breakdowns regarding age, race, socioeconomic status, or other factors, it is widely recognized that domestic violence affects individuals across various demographics. However, certain groups may be disproportionately impacted due to systemic issues, including economic instability, cultural norms, and access to resources.\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the demographics most affected by domestic violence, additional data from sources such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or local law enforcement agencies would be necessary. These sources often provide detailed reports that include demographic information and trends related to domestic violence.\n\nIn summary, while the statistics on the prevalence of domestic violence are alarming, the lack of specific demographic data in the gathered information limits a more nuanced analysis of which groups are most affected.
