    How did the demand for African labor influence housing policies in Johannesburg?
answer: >-
    The demand for African labor significantly influenced housing policies in Johannesburg, particularly in the early 20th century. Initially, the municipality recognized the economic necessity of accommodating African workers who were essential to the mining and manufacturing sectors. This led to a degree of racial integration, as municipal authorities facilitated African settlement in inner-city slum yards to meet labor demands. These slum yards became critical housing for African workers, despite their poor living conditions characterized by overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and exploitation by landlords.\n\nHowever, as the economic landscape evolved and segregationist sentiments grew among white constituencies—including manufacturers, miners, and working-class ratepayers—housing policies began to shift. The initial support for African housing transformed into a vilification of the so-called 'African slum problem.' This change was driven by public health concerns, where slum conditions were framed within racial narratives that depicted African populations as sources of disease and crime. Such narratives justified the implementation of more restrictive housing policies.\n\nThe culmination of these shifts was the enactment of the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923, which formalized racial segregation in urban areas. This legislation restricted African housing to designated locations, effectively enforcing racial separation and limiting African workers' access to better living conditions. The interplay between economic interests, public health concerns, and racial ideologies thus shaped the trajectory of housing policies in Johannesburg, reflecting broader themes of social stratification and racial control.\n\nIn summary, the demand for African labor initially led to supportive housing policies, but as segregationist attitudes took hold, these policies evolved to enforce racial separation, ultimately entrenching economic disparities and social stratification in the urban landscape of Johannesburg.
