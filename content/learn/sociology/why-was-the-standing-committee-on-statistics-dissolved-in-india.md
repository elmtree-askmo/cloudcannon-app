    Why was the Standing Committee on Statistics dissolved in India?
answer: >-
    The Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) in India was dissolved by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) primarily due to overlapping responsibilities with the newly formed Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys. The SCoS, which was chaired by eminent economist and former chief statistician Pronab Sen, had been overseeing statistical surveys and had raised concerns regarding delays in conducting the national census, which was last conducted in 2011.\n\nThe dissolution of the SCoS has been linked to its members' persistent inquiries about the delay in the decennial Census, which was due in 2021. This questioning reportedly led to tensions, as the committee's concerns highlighted significant issues regarding data reliability and the impact of outdated census data on policy decisions, including food ration benefits for millions of Indians.\n\nThe decision to disband the SCoS has sparked debate over the government's approach to statistical governance and data collection, raising concerns about the implications for policymaking in India. Following the dissolution, the National Statistical Commission (NSC) has regained prominence as the primary body responsible for addressing statistical issues in the country.
