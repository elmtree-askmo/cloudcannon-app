    What were the specific allegations in the Tirupati Laddus controversy?
answer: >-
    The Tirupati Laddus controversy primarily revolves around allegations made by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu regarding the quality of the ghee used in the preparation of the famous laddus offered at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) temple. Naidu claimed that lab reports indicated the laddus were contaminated with animal fat, suggesting that substandard ingredients were used during the tenure of the previous government led by Jagan Mohan Reddy.\n\nThe controversy gained momentum when Naidu alleged that the laddus, which are distributed to millions of devotees daily, were adulterated with both animal and vegetable fat. This claim was made public during a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislative party meeting, leading to significant political backlash. The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), led by Reddy, accused Naidu of making "heinous allegations" for political gain and invited people to participate in religious rituals to atone for what they termed Naidu's sins against the deity.\n\nIn response to the allegations, the Supreme Court of India intervened, mandating a Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), local police, and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to investigate the claims. The court emphasized that the investigation should not be politicized and aimed to address the concerns of millions of devotees.\n\nThe Supreme Court also questioned the timing and basis of Naidu's claims, highlighting that the allegations were made before an FIR was lodged and an SIT was constituted. The court sought evidence to support the allegations and expressed the need to keep religious sentiments separate from political discourse.\n\nOverall, the controversy has sparked a significant political row in Andhra Pradesh, with both parties engaging in a war of words over the integrity of the laddus and the implications for the temple's reputation.
