    How has the Bangladesh government responded to the student protests?
answer: >-
    The Bangladesh government's response to the recent student protests has been marked by significant unrest and a heavy-handed approach. The protests began in mid-June 2024, triggered by a High Court decision to reinstate a quota system that reserves 30% of government jobs for the descendants of veterans of the 1971 liberation war. Many students view this quota as outdated and unfair, leading to widespread demonstrations across university campuses.\n\nIn response to the escalating protests, the government deployed paramilitary units, including the Border Guard Bangladesh and the Rapid Action Battalion, which have been criticized for their records of human rights violations. Reports indicate that the authorities have used excessive force against protesters, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities. Amnesty International has documented instances of unlawful force and has called for investigations into the government's actions during the protests.\n\nThe situation has been further complicated by communication restrictions and internet shutdowns imposed by the government, which lasted for several days. These measures were intended to curb the protests but have drawn international condemnation, including from the United Nations, which described the attacks on student protesters as "shocking."\n\nOverall, the government's response has included both violent crackdowns and attempts to control the narrative surrounding the protests, leading to a tense atmosphere and ongoing calls for reform from the student population.
