    What are the eligibility requirements for kinship care through CAST?
answer: >-
    To be eligible for kinship care through the Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST), caregivers must meet the same requirements as foster and adoptive applicants. This includes undergoing a comprehensive assessment known as the Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE), which involves home visits by a CAST worker to evaluate the caregiver's suitability and readiness to provide care.\n\nSpecifically, the eligibility criteria for kinship care include:\n\n1. **Caregiver Requirements**: Individuals, couples, and families who wish to become kinship caregivers must complete the same training and assessment process as foster parents.\n\n2. **Child's Status**: The child or youth must be in the care of CAST, meaning they are officially recognized as a "child in care."\n\n3. **Support and Assistance**: Kinship caregivers are supported by a member of the CAST service team and may be eligible for Temporary Care Assistance through Ontario Works, as well as a range of additional supports based on need.\n\n4. **Connection to Family**: The kinship care arrangement is designed to keep children connected to their family, culture, and community, which is a fundamental aspect of the program.\n\nIn summary, kinship caregivers must go through a structured evaluation process and provide a stable environment for children who are in the care of CAST, ensuring that the child's connections to their family and community are maintained.
