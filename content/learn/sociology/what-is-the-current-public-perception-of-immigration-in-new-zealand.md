    What is the current public perception of immigration in New Zealand?
answer: >-
    The current public perception of immigration in New Zealand is characterized by a mix of positive and negative sentiments, as highlighted by various surveys and reports. According to the 2023 Public Perceptions of Immigration Survey conducted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), there are notable trends in how New Zealanders view immigration and its impacts.\n\n1. **Positive Contributions**: A significant portion of the population recognizes the positive effects of immigration on New Zealand's economy, productivity, culture, and society. In a survey conducted by Ipsos, 47% of respondents believed that immigration had a positive effect on the country, which is one of the highest positive responses among 23 countries surveyed.\n\n2. **Concerns About Numbers**: Despite the recognition of benefits, there is also a concern regarding the number of immigrants. The same Ipsos survey found that 42% of New Zealanders felt there were too many immigrants. This reflects a tension between acknowledging the contributions of immigrants and concerns about the scale of immigration.\n\n3. **Changing Immigration Landscape**: The immigration landscape in New Zealand has been influenced by recent changes in government policy and the relaxation of COVID-19-related border restrictions, leading to a record net migration gain of 96,200 in the year ending July 2023. This influx has likely contributed to the ongoing public discourse about immigration.\n\n4. **Public Accountability and Strategy**: The Immigration - Fit for the Future report released in 2022 pointed out a lack of consistency and strategy in immigration policies, as well as a need for greater public accountability. This suggests that while there is recognition of the benefits of immigration, there are also calls for more structured and transparent immigration policies.\n\n5. **Future Directions**: Looking ahead, New Zealand is expected to face several key immigration issues, including shifts in public sentiment and ongoing global trends. The coalition government has indicated priorities that will impact immigration settings, which may further influence public perceptions.\n\nIn summary, the public perception of immigration in New Zealand is complex, with a blend of appreciation for the contributions of immigrants and concerns about the implications of high immigration levels. The ongoing dialogue around immigration policies and their impacts will likely shape future perceptions and attitudes.
