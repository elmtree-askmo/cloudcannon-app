    How do social factors influence the development of IDD?
answer: >-
    Social factors play a significant role in the development and manifestation of Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD). Research indicates that up to 80% of the variation in IQ scores among individuals with syndromic IDDs can be attributed to nongenetic effects, including social-environmental factors. These factors encompass a wide range of influences, such as economic stability, access to healthcare, and the overall social determinants of health.\n\n1. **Economic Stability**: Economic factors are crucial as they can directly impact cognitive development. Individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds may face barriers to accessing quality education, healthcare, and supportive services, which can hinder their cognitive growth and adaptive functioning.\n\n2. **Social Determinants of Health**: The World Health Organization defines social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These determinants are shaped by the distribution of resources, power, and money, which can lead to disparities in health outcomes, including those related to IDD.\n\n3. **Family and Community Support**: Family dynamics and community support systems are vital for individuals with IDD. Family members often play a significant role in the care and advocacy for individuals with IDD, influencing their access to resources and opportunities. A supportive family environment can mitigate some of the negative impacts of social stressors.\n\n4. **Trauma and Stress**: Exposure to trauma and chronic stress can adversely affect brain development and functioning. Individuals with IDD may be more vulnerable to the effects of trauma, which can further complicate their developmental outcomes.\n\n5. **Stigma and Discrimination**: Stigma, discrimination, and social exclusion can significantly impact the identification and care of individuals with IDD, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These social barriers can lead to inadequate support and resources, exacerbating the challenges faced by individuals with IDD.\n\n6. **Access to Services**: Barriers to care, such as financial constraints, transportation issues, and food security, can limit access to necessary services for individuals with IDD. This lack of access can hinder their development and overall quality of life.\n\nIn summary, social factors, including economic stability, family support, exposure to trauma, and access to services, significantly influence the development and outcomes of individuals with Intellectual Developmental Disorder. Addressing these social determinants is essential for improving the lives of those affected by IDD.
