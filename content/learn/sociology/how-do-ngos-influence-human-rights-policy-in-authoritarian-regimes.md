    How do NGOs influence human rights policy in authoritarian regimes?
answer: >-
    Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a significant role in influencing human rights policy in authoritarian regimes, despite facing considerable challenges. Their influence can be understood through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Advocacy and Monitoring**: NGOs often act as advocates for human rights, lobbying both domestic and international bodies. They monitor government actions and report on human rights abuses, providing critical information that may not be available through official channels. For instance, NGOs submit shadow reports to UN human rights monitoring bodies, offering an alternative perspective on the human rights situation in their countries (point 7).\n\n2. **Navigating State Backlash**: In many authoritarian contexts, NGOs must navigate a landscape of state backlash against human rights accountability. This includes legal restrictions, such as China's anti-NGO law and Russia's Undesirable Organizations law, which aim to limit the activities of foreign and international NGOs (points 1 and 0). Despite these challenges, NGOs adapt their strategies to survive and continue their work, often operating within a narrow space allowed by the government (point 6).\n\n3. **Engagement with International Organizations**: NGOs often collaborate with international governmental organizations (IGOs) to influence policy. Their critical e-mobilizations, powered by new media, can lead to policy adjustments or concessions from IGOs, creating new consultative regimes that prioritize economic, social, and cultural rights (point 3).\n\n4. **Dual Roles of NGOs**: The literature highlights the duality of NGOs in authoritarian regimes, where some may act as regime-loyal organizations while others engage in advocacy (point 9). This complexity allows NGOs to operate in a way that can still promote human rights, even if they must align with certain government narratives to maintain their existence.\n\n5. **Civil Society Dynamics**: The shrinking civic space in authoritarian regimes has led to a re-evaluation of the role of civil society organizations (CSOs). Some NGOs may focus on service provision rather than advocacy, which can help them maintain a presence and influence within the regime (point 12). This adaptability is crucial for their survival and continued impact on human rights policies.\n\nIn summary, while NGOs face significant obstacles in authoritarian regimes, their advocacy, monitoring, engagement with international bodies, and adaptability to the political environment enable them to influence human rights policy, albeit within constrained parameters.
