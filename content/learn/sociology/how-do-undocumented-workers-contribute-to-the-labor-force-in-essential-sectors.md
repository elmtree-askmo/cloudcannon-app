    How do undocumented workers contribute to the labor force in essential sectors?
answer: >-
    Undocumented workers play a significant role in the labor force, particularly in essential sectors, which has become increasingly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to recent reports, approximately 74% of undocumented workers are classified as essential infrastructure workers, compared to 65% of the native-born labor force. This highlights their critical involvement in maintaining essential services and operations.\n\nIn the United States, there are an estimated 5 million undocumented essential workers who have been pivotal in combating the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring the continuity of various sectors. For instance, in New York State, undocumented immigrants constitute about 33% of the healthcare workforce, underscoring their vital contributions to public health during a crisis. These workers are not only integral to healthcare but also to other essential industries such as agriculture, construction, and food services.\n\nThe economic contributions of undocumented workers extend beyond their immediate roles. They are often community and family members, with many having spouses or parents who are also undocumented. This interconnectedness means that their economic activities—such as spending on housing, consumer goods, and services—have a ripple effect on local economies. For example, Mexican undocumented immigrants alone held over $82.2 billion in spending power after taxes, which significantly benefits local economies.\n\nDespite their contributions, undocumented workers face numerous challenges, including exclusion from federal relief measures during the pandemic. This exclusion has not only affected their financial stability but has also had broader economic implications, resulting in an estimated loss of $10 billion in potential economic output due to their ineligibility for stimulus payments.\n\nIn summary, undocumented workers are essential to the U.S. labor force, particularly in critical sectors, and their economic contributions are substantial. Recognizing and supporting their role can lead to more robust economic recovery and community resilience, especially in times of crisis.
