    What statements have been made by the government and police regarding the violence in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The violence in Manipur has prompted various statements from government officials and police, reflecting the ongoing ethnic tensions between the majority Meitei community and the Kuki and Naga tribal groups. \n\n1. **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**: In his first statement regarding the violence, which erupted on May 3, 2023, Modi asserted that "no guilty will be spared," responding to criticism for his delayed reaction to the crisis. His appeal for peace came after months of ethnic violence that resulted in over 150 deaths.\n\n2. **Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh**: The Chief Minister announced arrests related to the violence and defended the government's slow response by claiming that "hundreds of similar cases have taken place." He also mentioned that the internet was shut down as a precautionary measure in light of the ongoing unrest.\n\n3. **Manipur Police**: In response to a viral video depicting a violent incident involving Kuki women, the police registered a case of abduction, gang rape, and murder against unidentified individuals. Additionally, the police have faced criticism for filing FIRs against journalists who reported on the violence, indicating a contentious relationship between the media and the state authorities.\n\n4. **Supreme Court of India**: The Supreme Court has expressed concern over the law and order situation in Manipur, stating that it "cannot run law and order in the state," highlighting the challenges faced by the state government in managing the escalating violence.\n\nThese statements reflect a complex and evolving situation in Manipur, where ethnic violence has led to significant human rights concerns and calls for urgent intervention from both state and national authorities.
