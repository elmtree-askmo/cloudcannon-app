    What diplomatic efforts have been made to secure the release of Indians from the Russian army?
answer: >-
    Diplomatic efforts to secure the release of Indians from the Russian army have been ongoing, particularly following a concerning situation that emerged in January 2024. Reports indicated that Indian youths had been misled into joining the Russian military. In response to this issue, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the matter during his visit to Moscow in July 2024, where he discussed the situation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs a result of these diplomatic engagements, Russia agreed to release all Indian nationals who were serving in its military. By the latest updates, approximately 45 Indian nationals have already been discharged, with efforts continuing to secure the release of around 50 more. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India confirmed that 35 of those discharged were released following Prime Minister Modi's discussions with President Putin.\n\nThe situation has highlighted the importance of diplomatic channels in addressing the concerns of Indian citizens abroad, particularly in conflict zones. The Indian government remains committed to ensuring the safe return of its nationals who were misled into military service.
