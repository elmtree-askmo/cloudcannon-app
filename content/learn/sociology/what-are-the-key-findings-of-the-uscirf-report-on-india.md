    What are the key findings of the USCIRF report on India?
answer: >-
    The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) released its annual report for 2024, which highlights significant concerns regarding the state of religious freedom in India. Here are the key findings from the report:\n\n1. **Escalating Violence Against Minorities**: The report indicates a troubling increase in violence against religious minorities, particularly Muslims. It documents instances of killings, beatings, and lynchings perpetrated by vigilante groups.\n\n2. **Deteriorating Religious Freedom Conditions**: The USCIRF report states that the conditions for religious freedom in India have continued to worsen, with the situation described as being on a "deteriorating and concerning trajectory."\n\n3. **Government Actions**: The report criticizes the Indian government for policies and actions that have contributed to the decline in religious freedom. It notes that religious leaders have been arbitrarily arrested, and there have been widespread reports of harassment and violence against religious minorities.\n\n4. **Designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC)**: One of the primary recommendations from the USCIRF is for the U.S. Congress to designate India as a Country of Particular Concern due to the severe violations of religious freedom.\n\n5. **Rejection of Findings by India**: The Indian government has rejected the findings of the USCIRF report, labeling the organization as biased and politically motivated.\n\nThese findings reflect ongoing concerns about the state of religious freedom in India and highlight the need for international attention and action regarding these issues.
