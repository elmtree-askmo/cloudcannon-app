    How credible is the High-Powered Committee involved in the Great Nicobar Island Development Project?
answer: >-
    The credibility of the High-Powered Committee (HPC) involved in the Great Nicobar Island Development Project has been called into question by various stakeholders, particularly by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. He has raised concerns regarding the committee's composition, alleging that it lacks independent experts, which could lead to potential biases in its conclusions. Ramesh has also criticized the government for keeping the committee's report secret, suggesting a lack of transparency in the review process.\n\nThe HPC was tasked with revisiting the environmental clearances granted to the project, which has been a contentious issue due to the ecological sensitivity of the Great Nicobar Island. The project aims for "holistic development" and has been approved by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change after extensive assessments. However, the ongoing deliberations by the National Green Tribunal regarding the project's environmental impact further complicate the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the HPC is officially responsible for overseeing the project's environmental assessments, its credibility is under scrutiny due to concerns about its composition, transparency, and the potential for bias, as highlighted by critics like Jairam Ramesh.
