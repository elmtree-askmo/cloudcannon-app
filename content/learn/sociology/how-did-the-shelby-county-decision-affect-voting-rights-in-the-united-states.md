    How did the Shelby County decision affect voting rights in the United States?
answer: >-
    The Supreme Court's decision in *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013) significantly affected voting rights in the United States by dismantling key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Specifically, the Court declared Section 4(b) of the Act unconstitutional, which had established a formula to identify jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting. This ruling effectively nullified the preclearance requirement outlined in Section 5, which mandated that these jurisdictions obtain federal approval before making any changes to their voting laws or practices.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the *Shelby County* decision saw a surge in laws that critics argue suppress voter participation, particularly among minority and low-income communities. For instance, within hours of the ruling, Texas announced that its strict voter ID law, previously blocked by preclearance, would take effect immediately. This pattern was observed across various states, with reports indicating that 22 states enacted 41 laws restricting voting access in the years following the decision. Many of these laws have been criticized for their racially discriminatory impact, further exacerbating barriers to voting for Black and brown voters.\n\nOverall, the *Shelby County* decision has been described as a turning point that opened the floodgates to restrictive voting laws, undermining decades of progress in protecting voting rights and access in the United States. The ruling has had a lasting legacy, as it has emboldened politicians to pursue measures that limit the electoral power of specific communities, raising concerns about the future of voting rights in the country.
