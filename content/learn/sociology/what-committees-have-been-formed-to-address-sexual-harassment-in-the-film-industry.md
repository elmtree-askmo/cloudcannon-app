    What committees have been formed to address sexual harassment in the film industry?
answer: >-
    To address sexual harassment in the film industry, several committees have been formed across different regional film sectors in India. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Hema Committee**: This committee was established in the Malayalam film industry and is named after its chairperson, Justice K. Hema, a former judge of the Kerala High Court. The committee was commissioned to investigate issues of gender inequality, sexual harassment, and workplace discrimination. It was formed in response to a petition by the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) following a high-profile sexual assault case involving a woman actor.\n\n2. **Nadigar Sangam Committee**: In the Tamil film industry, the Nadigar Sangam announced the formation of a committee chaired by actress Rohini to specifically address complaints of sexual harassment. This initiative aims to provide a platform for victims to report their grievances and seek justice.\n\n3. **Independent Committee Calls**: There have been calls from various industry leaders, including Suresh Shyamlal Gupta, President of the All Indian Cine Workers Association (AICWA), for the establishment of an independent and unbiased committee to combat sexual harassment across the film industry.\n\n4. **Internal Review Committees**: In Bollywood, director Ajay Bahl has advocated for the creation of internal review committees to ensure confidentiality and support for complainants, fostering a safer work environment.\n\n5. **Producers Guild of India**: The Producers Guild has developed a handbook on the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace and mandated that all film production houses comply with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 (PoSH Act). This includes the requirement for organizations with ten or more employees to establish an Internal Committee to address complaints.\n\n6. **Kerala High Court Directive**: The Kerala High Court has also urged film industry organizations to form a joint committee to handle cases of sexual harassment, reinforcing the need for compliance with the PoSH Act.\n\nThese initiatives reflect a growing recognition of the need to address sexual harassment in the film industry and provide mechanisms for victims to seek redress.
