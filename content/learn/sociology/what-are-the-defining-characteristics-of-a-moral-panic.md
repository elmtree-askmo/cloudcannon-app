    What are the defining characteristics of a moral panic?
answer: >-
    Moral panic is a sociological concept that describes a situation where public concern and anxiety about a perceived social problem escalate to a level that is disproportionate to the actual threat posed. The defining characteristics of a moral panic include:\n\n1. **Folk Devils**: Central to the concept is the creation of a "folk devil," which refers to a particular social group or individual that is demonized and blamed for societal issues. This group becomes the target of public outrage and fear.\n\n2. **Media Amplification**: The media plays a crucial role in amplifying the perceived threat. Through sensational reporting, the media can exaggerate the scope and impact of the issue, leading to heightened public concern.\n\n3. **Public Concern and Anxiety**: Moral panics are fueled by widespread public anxiety and fear. This collective emotional response often leads to demands for action from authorities to address the perceived threat.\n\n4. **Political and Institutional Response**: Politicians and law enforcement often capitalize on moral panics to gain support or justify new policies and laws aimed at controlling the identified threat. This can result in significant changes in legislation or social policy.\n\n5. **Volatility**: Moral panics tend to emerge and dissipate rapidly, often replaced by new moral panics as societal concerns shift. This volatility reflects the transient nature of public fears and the media's role in shaping them.\n\n6. **Disproportionate Reaction**: The societal response to the perceived threat is often disproportionate to the actual level of risk involved. This can lead to overreactions, such as increased policing, new laws, or social stigmatization of the folk devils.\n\n7. **Legacy**: While moral panics may be short-lived, they often leave behind an informal or institutional legacy, influencing public perceptions and policies long after the initial panic has subsided.\n\nThese characteristics illustrate how moral panics are complex social phenomena that involve the interplay between media, public perception, and political action, often resulting in significant societal consequences.
