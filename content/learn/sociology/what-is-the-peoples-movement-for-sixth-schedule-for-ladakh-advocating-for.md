    What is the People's Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh advocating for?
answer: >-
    The People's Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh is advocating for the inclusion of Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This movement has gained momentum particularly after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which removed the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, of which Ladakh was a part. The primary goals of this movement include:\n\n1. **Cultural Preservation**: The people of Ladakh are concerned about the preservation of their unique cultural identity and heritage. The Sixth Schedule would provide constitutional safeguards to protect their customs and traditions.\n\n2. **Environmental Protection**: Given Ladakh's fragile ecosystem, the movement emphasizes the need for local governance to manage natural resources sustainably. The Sixth Schedule would allow local communities to have a say in decisions regarding land, forests, and mining.\n\n3. **Political Autonomy**: The demand for Sixth Schedule status is also driven by a desire for greater political autonomy. This would empower local tribal communities, which make up a significant portion of Ladakh's population (approximately 97% according to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes), to govern themselves and make decisions that directly affect their lives.\n\n4. **Self-Governance**: The movement seeks to establish a framework for self-governance that would allow local leaders and communities to have control over their affairs, rather than being governed directly by the central government.\n\n5. **Response to Central Government's Stance**: Despite ongoing negotiations with the central government, local leaders and activists, including prominent figures like Sonam Wangchuk, have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's reluctance to grant Sixth Schedule status. Protests and hunger strikes have been organized to draw attention to these demands.\n\n6. **Statehood Demand**: In addition to seeking Sixth Schedule status, the movement also calls for elevating Ladakh from its current Union Territory status to a full-fledged state, which would provide greater political representation and decision-making powers.\n\nOverall, the People's Movement for Sixth Schedule for Ladakh is a significant ecological and democratic initiative aimed at reclaiming agency over the region's future, ensuring the protection of its land, culture, and environment.
