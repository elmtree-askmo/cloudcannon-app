    How does the social model of disability differ from the medical model?
answer: >-
    The social model of disability and the medical model of disability represent two fundamentally different approaches to understanding disability.\n\n1. **Definition of Disability**:\n   - The **medical model** views disability as a deficiency or abnormality within the individual. It focuses on the individual's impairments or differences and often seeks to "fix" these through medical interventions. This model tends to emphasize what is "wrong" with the person rather than what they need to thrive in society.\n   - In contrast, the **social model** sees disability as a result of societal barriers and the way society is organized. It posits that individuals are disabled not by their impairments but by the physical, social, and attitudinal barriers that exist in the environment. This model recognizes that while individuals may have medical conditions, they are also disabled by the world around them.\n\n2. **Focus of Intervention**:\n   - The medical model advocates for medical treatments and interventions aimed at correcting or alleviating the individual's impairments. This often leads to a focus on rehabilitation and therapy.\n   - The social model emphasizes the need for societal change, advocating for inclusive policies and practices that remove barriers and promote accessibility. It encourages adaptations in the environment to accommodate a range of functional abilities.\n\n3. **Perception of Disability**:\n   - Under the medical model, disability is often viewed negatively, leading to low expectations for individuals with disabilities. This can result in a loss of independence, choice, and control over their lives.\n   - The social model reframes disability as a difference, akin to variations in gender, age, or race, promoting a more positive understanding of diversity. It encourages society to recognize and value the contributions of individuals with disabilities.\n\n4. **Community Perspective**:\n   - The medical model tends to position disabled individuals as patients or medical curiosities, often leading to stigmatization.\n   - The social model empowers individuals with disabilities by advocating for their rights and promoting their agency within society. It encourages a collective responsibility to create an inclusive environment.\n\n5. **Historical Context**:\n   - The social model emerged in direct opposition to the medical model, which has dominated the understanding of disability for many years. The social model has evolved over the last 40 years, gaining traction within the disability community and influencing legislation and policy.\n\nIn summary, while the medical model focuses on individual impairments and seeks to remedy them, the social model emphasizes the role of societal structures in creating disability and advocates for systemic change to foster inclusivity and accessibility.
