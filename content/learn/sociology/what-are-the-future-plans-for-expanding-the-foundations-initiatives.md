    What are the future plans for expanding the foundation's initiatives?
answer: >-
    The Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation has several future plans aimed at expanding its initiatives and enhancing support for women and children affected by violence. Key aspects of these plans include:\n\n1. **North York Women's Shelter Redevelopment**: The foundation is actively involved in the redevelopment of a new North York Women's Shelter (NYWS) facility, which is set to be located at 940 Sheppard Avenue West. A Site Plan Application (SPA) has already been submitted to the City of Toronto's planning department. The new facility, designed by LGA Architectural Partners, will be a three-storey crisis care center that aims to replace the existing shelter built in 1984. This redevelopment is intended to better serve the needs of women and children, with the design allowing for an expansion from thirty to forty beds if necessary.\n\n2. **Fundraising Initiatives**: The foundation is on a mission to raise $1 million for the North York Women's Shelter, which has been a vital resource for over 11,000 women and children over the past 33 years. This fundraising effort is crucial for supporting the shelter's operations and the expansion of its services.\n\n3. **Trauma-Informed Support Services**: The foundation is committed to providing trauma-informed support that makes services accessible to populations often denied such assistance. This includes the establishment of a Trauma-Informed Community Health Clinic, which offers wrap-around services to women experiencing violence.\n\n4. **Community Engagement and Awareness**: The Anne Marie D'Amico Day of Kindness and Love, celebrated annually on April 23rd, aims to engage students and the community in acts of kindness, fostering a culture of care and support. This initiative is part of the foundation's broader goal to raise awareness about violence against women and promote empowerment.\n\n5. **The Turtle Project**: This initiative is part of the foundation's efforts to create supportive environments for women and children, although specific details about its future plans were not provided in the gathered information.\n\nOverall, the Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation is focused on creating sustainable solutions and expanding its reach to better support those affected by violence, ensuring that its initiatives continue to grow and adapt to the needs of the community.
