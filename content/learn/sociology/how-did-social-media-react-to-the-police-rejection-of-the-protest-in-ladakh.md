    How did social media react to the police rejection of the protest in Ladakh?
answer: >-
    The social media reaction to the police rejection of the protest in Ladakh, particularly following the detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, has been significant and multifaceted. Many users expressed outrage over the police's actions, with hashtags and posts condemning the detention and calling for solidarity among the people of Ladakh. The protests were characterized by chants of “Delhi Police, shame shame,” reflecting the anger directed at the authorities for suppressing peaceful demonstrations.\n\nProminent political figures and activists also took to social media to voice their discontent. For instance, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized the Modi government for failing to uphold promises made to the people of Ladakh, highlighting the irony of a government that could not prevent external threats but chose to detain its own citizens peacefully advocating for their rights.\n\nAdditionally, Sonam Wangchuk himself utilized social media to address concerns about misinformation regarding the protests, urging the police to take action against the spread of fake news. His posts aimed to clarify the intentions behind the protests and to rally support for the cause of environmental and constitutional rights in Ladakh.\n\nOverall, social media served as a platform for mobilization, information dissemination, and expression of solidarity among supporters of the protest, amplifying the voices of those advocating for statehood and constitutional protections for Ladakh.
