answer: >-
    Dell Hymes made significant contributions to the concept of communicative competence, particularly in relation to formality and appropriateness in language use. His work emerged as a response to Noam Chomsky's distinction between linguistic competence and performance, which Hymes found inadequate for understanding real-world communication.\n\n1. **Definition of Communicative Competence**: Hymes introduced the term "communicative competence" in 1966, emphasizing that effective communication involves not only grammatical knowledge but also the ability to use language appropriately in various social contexts. This includes understanding the nuances of formality, politeness, and the social dynamics at play in different communicative situations.\n\n2. **Ethnography of Communication**: Hymes' approach is rooted in the ethnography of communication, which examines how language functions within its socio-cultural context. He proposed that communicative competence encompasses several dimensions, including:\n   - **Linguistic Competence**: Knowledge of grammar and vocabulary.\n   - **Sociolinguistic Competence**: Understanding the social rules that govern language use, including appropriateness and formality.\n   - **Discourse Competence**: The ability to produce and interpret coherent and cohesive texts.\n   - **Strategic Competence**: The ability to use communication strategies to overcome difficulties in communication.\n\n3. **Parameters of Communication**: Hymes outlined specific parameters that govern communication, which include:\n   - **What to say**: The content of the message.\n   - **When to say it**: Timing and context of the communication.\n   - **To whom to say it**: The audience and their social status.\n   - **How to say it**: The style and formality of the language used.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: Hymes emphasized the importance of understanding language as a socially embedded practice. He argued that communicative competence must account for cultural norms and social structures that shape how language is used. For instance, the level of formality required in a business meeting in Japan may differ significantly from that in a casual setting in the United States, highlighting the need for contextually appropriate language use.\n\n5. **Impact on Discourse Analysis**: Hymes' concept of communicative competence has been influential in discourse analysis, helping analysts understand why individuals choose specific forms of language in particular contexts. His work encourages consideration of how social and cultural norms influence communication choices, thereby integrating language and culture in the study of discourse.\n\nIn summary, Dell Hymes' contributions to communicative competence underscore the necessity of understanding language not just as a set of grammatical rules but as a complex social tool that varies in formality and appropriateness depending on the context and the participants involved. His work laid the groundwork for further exploration of how language functions within society, influencing both linguistic theory and practical applications in language education.
