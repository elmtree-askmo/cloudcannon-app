    "The Social Dilemma," directed by Jeff Orlowski and released in 2020, is a thought-provoking documentary that delves into the profound effects of social media on society. The film combines interviews with experts from various fields, including psychology, sociology, and computer science, with dramatized scenarios that illustrate the hidden workings of social media algorithms. \n\nOne of the central themes of the documentary is the notion that "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product." This highlights how social media companies monetize user data and attention, often at the expense of user privacy and mental health. The documentary emphasizes that social media platforms are designed to be addictive, leveraging persuasive technology and algorithms that manipulate user behavior to maximize engagement.\n\nThe film also addresses the ethical implications of data collection and the lack of transparency surrounding algorithms. It raises concerns about privacy violations and the responsibility of tech companies to design their platforms ethically. The experts featured in the documentary, many of whom are former executives from major tech companies like Google and Facebook, express their fears about the societal consequences of their creations, including the erosion of mental health and the destabilization of democratic processes.\n\n"The Social Dilemma" has sparked significant public discourse and prompted calls for stricter regulations on data privacy and social media practices. It serves as a wake-up call for users to critically evaluate their relationship with technology and the impact of social media on their lives. The documentary ultimately encourages viewers to consider the broader implications of their online behavior and the need for greater awareness and regulation in the digital age.
