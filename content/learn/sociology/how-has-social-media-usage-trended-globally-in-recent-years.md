answer: >-
    In recent years, social media usage has shown significant trends globally. As of September 2023, there are approximately 5.17 billion social media users worldwide, which represents about 63.7% of the global population and nearly 95% of all internet users. This marks an increase of 150 million new social media users between April 2022 and April 2023, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 3.2%. This translates to around 410,000 new users each day, or 4.7 users every second.\n\nThe global social media market has also experienced substantial growth, increasing from $193.52 billion in 2022 to $231.1 billion in 2023, which corresponds to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4%. This growth has been influenced by various factors, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nIn terms of platform popularity, YouTube remains the most widely used social media platform, with 97% of respondents in a recent survey indicating they use it. Facebook continues to be the primary social channel for news globally, despite the rise of other platforms. Notably, there has been a rapid growth in the usage of Threads, a newer platform, indicating shifting preferences among users.\n\nMoreover, the average number of social networks used by individuals has increased, with users engaging with an average of 6.6 different platforms each month. This diversification in platform usage highlights the evolving landscape of social media and the increasing complexity of user engagement.\n\nOverall, the trends indicate a robust and growing global social media landscape, characterized by increasing user numbers, significant market growth, and shifting preferences among platforms.
