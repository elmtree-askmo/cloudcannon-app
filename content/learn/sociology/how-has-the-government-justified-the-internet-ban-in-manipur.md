    How has the government justified the internet ban in Manipur?
answer: >-
    The government of Manipur has justified the internet ban primarily as a measure to maintain law and order amid escalating violence and unrest in the region. The authorities expressed concerns that "anti-social elements" might exploit social media to spread inflammatory content, which could further exacerbate tensions. \n\nThe internet shutdown was first imposed on November 16, 2023, and was extended multiple times due to ongoing concerns about public safety. The government cited the need to prevent the transmission of images and hate speech that could incite violence, particularly in the context of ethnic conflicts that have been affecting the state. \n\nIn addition to the initial ban, the suspension of mobile internet services was extended for three more days in several districts, indicating a continued assessment of the law and order situation. The government has also noted that the decision to lift the ban would depend on improvements in the security environment, as evidenced by reports from law enforcement indicating a decrease in violent incidents.\n\nOverall, the justification for the internet ban in Manipur reflects a broader trend in which governments may resort to such measures as a quick-fix solution to manage civil unrest and maintain public order.
