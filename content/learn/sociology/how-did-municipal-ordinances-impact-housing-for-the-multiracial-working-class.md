    How did municipal ordinances impact housing for the multi-racial working class?
answer: >-
    Municipal ordinances significantly impacted housing for the multi-racial working class in Johannesburg, particularly during the early 20th century. Initially, the municipality played a crucial role in facilitating housing for African workers in the inner city, which was a response to the economic demands of the manufacturing sector. This approach was somewhat defiant against the national policies of segregation that sought to confine African populations to designated compounds or locations.\n\nHowever, the passage of the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923 marked a pivotal shift in municipal strategies. Following this legislation, the Johannesburg municipality quickly moved to enforce segregationist policies that overturned its earlier support for African settlement. This transition was influenced by various pressures, including the interests of white constituencies such as manufacturers and miners, who began to view African housing as a problem rather than a necessity.\n\nThe municipal strategies evolved from initially supporting a multi-racial working class to implementing ordinances that restricted African residential occupation. This included the vilification of slum conditions, which were often used to justify the enforcement of segregation. The slum-yards, which served as significant accommodation for African workers, were characterized by overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and exploitation by landlords, further exacerbating the living conditions for the multi-racial working class.\n\nIn summary, municipal ordinances in Johannesburg transitioned from a more inclusive approach to one that enforced racial segregation, reflecting the complexities of urban governance in a racially divided society. This shift not only impacted housing availability for the multi-racial working class but also reinforced social stratification and economic disparities within the urban landscape.
