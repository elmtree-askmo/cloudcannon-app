    What is cohesion in networks?
answer: >-
    Cohesion in networks refers to the strength of relationships and the degree of connectivity among the nodes (or actors) within a network. It is a critical concept in social network analysis, as it helps to understand how tightly knit a network is and how resilient it is to fragmentation. Cohesion can be measured in various ways, including:\n\n1. **Network Closure**: This dimension of cohesion is defined as the extent to which actors in a network are connected to one another, forming tightly knit groups. High network closure indicates that most members are interconnected, which can enhance trust and cooperation among them.\n\n2. **Cliquishness**: This refers to the degree to which an actor is connected to multiple cohesive sub-groups within the network. An actor with high cliquishness is likely to have strong ties with several tightly connected groups, which can facilitate the flow of information and resources.\n\n3. **Overall Network Strength**: Cohesion can also be assessed by examining the weakest links in the network. The concept of "joint maximal cohesion" provides a summary of the network's overall strength, indicating that the network is only as strong as its weakest connection.\n\nCohesion is important for several reasons:\n- It influences the stability and adaptability of networks, particularly in uncertain environments.\n- High cohesion can facilitate norm maintenance and the formation of communities, as members are more likely to share common values and support each other.\n- It plays a role in the diffusion of information and resources, as tightly connected networks can spread influence more effectively.\n\nIn summary, cohesion in networks is a multifaceted concept that encompasses the strength of ties among members, the structure of connections, and the overall robustness of the network. Understanding cohesion is essential for analyzing social dynamics and the functioning of various types of networks.
