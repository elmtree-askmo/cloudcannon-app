    How is deviance defined sociologically?
answer: >-
    In sociology, deviance is defined as behaviors or actions that violate widely-accepted cultural norms within a society. This concept is inherently relative, meaning that what is considered deviant can vary significantly across different societies and historical periods. The determination of deviance is often influenced by those in power, as they have the authority to define and enforce social norms.\n\nDeviance can be categorized into several types:\n\n1. **Formal Deviance**: This refers to behaviors that are codified in laws, such as criminal acts.\n2. **Informal Deviance**: This involves breaking social norms without necessarily violating laws, such as unconventional dress or behavior.\n3. **Subcultural Deviance**: This occurs when behaviors are deemed deviant by the larger society but are accepted within a specific subculture.\n\nSociologist Ã‰mile Durkheim viewed deviance as a natural and necessary part of society, arguing that it plays a crucial role in social change and the clarification of social norms. He believed that deviance can lead to innovation and the re-evaluation of societal values.\n\nTheories of deviance, such as conflict theory, suggest that deviant behavior often arises from social systems that oppress certain groups, leading them to engage in actions that challenge the status quo. Other theories, like Edwin Sutherland's differential association theory, propose that deviance is learned through social interactions rather than being an inherent trait.\n\nOverall, deviance is a complex sociological concept that encompasses a wide range of behaviors and is shaped by cultural, social, and historical contexts.
