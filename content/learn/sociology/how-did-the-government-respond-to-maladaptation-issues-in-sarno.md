    How did the government respond to maladaptation issues in Sarno?
answer: >-
    The government response to maladaptation issues in Sarno, Italy, particularly following the devastating mudslide in 1988, involved a series of political and administrative actions that ultimately led to further maladaptive policies. Initially, the President of the Campania Regional Authority, Antonio Bassolino, was appointed as Emergency Commissioner to oversee the response to the disaster. Subsequently, the government issued Order no. 3270 on March 12, 2003, which aimed to address the socio-economic and environmental emergencies in the drainage basin of the River Sarno.\n\nHowever, the analysis of this political process reveals that the collaboration between civil society and ruling classes under certain conditions can lead to the formulation of policies that are maladaptive. This suggests that the government's response, while intended to mitigate the impacts of the disaster, may have inadvertently contributed to ongoing environmental degradation and social vulnerabilities in the region.\n\nThe case of Sarno illustrates the complexities of environmental governance and the challenges faced by the state in effectively addressing the consequences of climate change and natural disasters. The interplay of political decisions, local governance, and community engagement is crucial in understanding how maladaptation can occur in the aftermath of such events.
