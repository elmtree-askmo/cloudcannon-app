His work encourages readers to reflect on the complexities of race and ethnicity in America, providing a platform for understanding the Chinese American experience in a broader context.\n\n2. **Civic Engagement**: As a co-founder of the non-profit organization Citizen University, Liu advocates for civic engagement and empowerment among marginalized communities, including Chinese Americans. His efforts to promote active citizenship and community involvement help to reshape the narrative around Asian Americans, emphasizing their contributions to society and the importance of their voices in the democratic process.\n\n3. **Public Discourse**: Liu's participation in public discussions and forums on race and identity has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by Chinese Americans. He addresses issues of representation, discrimination, and the need for greater inclusivity in American society.\n\n### Conclusion\nTogether, Bruce Lee and Eric Liu have significantly influenced cultural perceptions of Chinese Americans by challenging stereotypes, promoting cultural pride, and advocating for civic engagement.
