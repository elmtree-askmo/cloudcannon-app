    What was the purpose of the Hema Committee in Kerala?
answer: >-
    The Hema Committee was established by the Kerala government in 2017 in response to growing concerns about sexual harassment and gender inequality within the Malayalam film industry. The committee, headed by retired Kerala High Court judge Justice K. Hema, aimed to investigate these issues following a petition from the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), which highlighted the challenges faced by women in the industry.\n\nThe committee recorded numerous statements from actors and technicians and released its report on August 19, 2024, after a significant delay. The findings revealed a pervasive culture of sexual harassment and power abuse, indicating that the Malayalam film industry was largely controlled by an all-male "power group" that significantly influenced casting and production decisions. The report detailed alarming accounts of discrimination, exploitation, and harassment faced by women working in the industry.\n\nIn light of the report's findings, the Kerala government has initiated further actions, including the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment. The release of the report has also led to significant repercussions within the industry, including the dissolution of the executive committee of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) in response to the revelations.\n\nOverall, the Hema Committee's purpose was to address and investigate the systemic issues of harassment and inequality in the Malayalam film industry, ultimately aiming to improve the working conditions and safety of women in this field.
