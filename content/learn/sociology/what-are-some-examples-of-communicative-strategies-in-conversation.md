answer: >-
    Communicative strategies are essential tools that facilitate effective conversation and interaction. Here are some examples of communicative strategies used in conversation:\n\n1. **Nomination**: This strategy involves clearly introducing a topic in a truthful and relevant manner. It sets the stage for the conversation and helps participants understand what will be discussed.\n\n2. **Turn-taking**: This strategy requires speakers to recognize when it is their turn to speak, often indicated by verbal or nonverbal cues. It helps maintain the flow of conversation and ensures that all participants have the opportunity to contribute.\n\n3. **Repair**: This strategy addresses problems in speaking, listening, or comprehension that may arise during a conversation. For example, if multiple people talk at once, a speaker might pause and acknowledge others to refocus the discussion.\n\n4. **Topic Control**: This involves using questions or prompts to guide the conversation and keep it on track. It allows the speaker to manage the flow of discussion and encourage participation from others.\n\n5. **Topic Shifting**: This strategy is used to introduce a new topic into the conversation. It is most effective when the discussion can naturally transition to the new subject, maintaining engagement among participants.\n\n6. **Termination**: This strategy signals the end of the conversation through verbal and nonverbal messages. It helps both speakers and listeners understand that the interaction is concluding.\n\n7. **Restriction**: This strategy constrains a listener's response within specific categories, guiding the conversation in a particular direction.\n\nThese strategies not only enhance the clarity and effectiveness of communication but also empower speakers and listeners to engage more meaningfully in conversations. Understanding and applying these strategies can significantly improve conversational fluency and interaction quality.
