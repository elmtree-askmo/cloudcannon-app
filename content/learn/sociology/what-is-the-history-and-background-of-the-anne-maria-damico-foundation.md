    What is the history and background of the Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation?
answer: >-
    The Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation (AMDF) was established in response to the tragic events of the Toronto Van Attack on April 23, 2018, which resulted in the deaths of 10 individuals, including Anne Marie D'Amico herself. This incident is recognized as the deadliest vehicular mass murder in Canadian history, leaving a profound impact on the victims' families and the community at large.\n\nFollowing the loss of their daughter and sister, the D'Amico family sought to honor Anne Marie's legacy by creating a foundation dedicated to promoting positive change and supporting those affected by violence. The foundation was officially launched on December 3, 2018, a date that holds significance as it would have been Anne Marie's birthday. Since its inception, the AMDF has raised over $500,000 to support its initiatives aimed at helping women and children live free from violence.\n\nThe mission of the Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation is to shift social and cultural norms by collaborating with organizations and individuals who share a vision of raising awareness about violence and its impacts. One of the foundation's notable initiatives is the Anne Marie D'Amico Day of Kindness and Love, celebrated annually on April 23, which encourages students to engage in acts of kindness and compassion.\n\nThrough its various programs and partnerships, the AMDF continues to work towards creating a safer and more supportive environment for those affected by violence, embodying the spirit of altruism that Anne Marie D'Amico exemplified in her life.
