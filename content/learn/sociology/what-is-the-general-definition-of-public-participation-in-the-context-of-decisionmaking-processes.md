    What is the general definition of public participation in the context of decision-making processes?
answer: >-
    Public participation, particularly in the context of decision-making processes, is generally defined as the involvement of individuals and groups who are affected by or have an interest in a project, program, plan, or policy. This involvement is crucial to ensure that diverse stakeholder perspectives are considered in the decision-making process. \n\nThe International Association for Impact Assessment emphasizes that public participation is about engaging those who are impacted by decisions, while other definitions highlight the importance of redistributing power and empowering marginalized communities. This broader view underscores the role of public participation in promoting social equity and justice, ensuring that voices often excluded from traditional decision-making processes are included.\n\nIn summary, public participation is a vital component of effective decision-making processes, particularly in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), as it fosters transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness to stakeholder input.
