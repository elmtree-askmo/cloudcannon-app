    What concerns have been raised by the Women in Cinema Collective?
answer: >-
    The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) has raised several significant concerns regarding the treatment of women in the Malayalam film industry. Formed in response to a high-profile case of sexual assault in 2017, the WCC has focused on addressing issues such as sexual harassment, gender inequality, and the lack of safe working conditions for women in cinema.\n\n1. **Sexual Harassment**: One of the primary concerns highlighted by the WCC is the pervasive nature of sexual harassment within the industry. The Justice Hema Committee report, which was influenced by the WCC's advocacy, revealed the widespread and persistent nature of these issues, prompting a call for systemic change.\n\n2. **Informal Bans and Discrimination**: Members of the WCC have reported facing informal bans in the industry, where their association with the collective has led to a lack of job offers. This has created an environment where women feel marginalized and ostracized for advocating for their rights.\n\n3. **Lack of Facilities**: The WCC has pointed out the inadequate facilities available for women on film sets, including a lack of toilet facilities and changing rooms. This lack of basic amenities contributes to an unsafe and uncomfortable working environment for female crew members.\n\n4. **Wage Disparity**: The collective has also raised concerns about wage disparity, highlighting that women often receive lower pay compared to their male counterparts for similar roles and responsibilities.\n\n5. **Safety Issues**: Safety-related concerns have been a significant focus for the WCC, emphasizing the need for better protective measures for women working in the film industry to ensure their well-being.\n\n6. **Advocacy for Policy Change**: The WCC has been actively involved in advocating for policy changes to promote gender equality in the industry. They have partnered with organizations like Sakhi Women Resource to produce reports with recommendations aimed at addressing gender issues in South Indian film industries.\n\nOverall, the Women in Cinema Collective has played a crucial role in bringing attention to these pressing issues, advocating for a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination and violence against women, and striving for a more equitable and safe working environment in the Malayalam film industry.
