    How does the foundation collaborate with North York Women's Shelter?
answer: >-
    The Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation (AMDF) collaborates closely with the North York Women's Shelter (NYWS) to provide essential support and services to women and children affected by violence. This partnership is particularly significant as the foundation was established in memory of Anne Marie D'Amico, a victim of violence, and aims to honor her legacy by supporting initiatives that empower and assist those in need.\n\nOne of the key aspects of this collaboration is the financial support that the AMDF is raising for the NYWS. The foundation is currently on a mission to raise $1 million to aid the shelter, which has been a refuge for over 11,000 women and children over its 33 years of operation. The NYWS is recognized for its trauma-informed approach and has recently expanded its facilities to include a new 24,000 square foot shelter designed to provide a safe and supportive environment for its residents.\n\nAdditionally, the AMDF supports the Anne Marie D'Amico Community Collective, which serves as a wrap-around service hub for women in the North York community who have experienced violence. This collective offers a variety of services, including trauma-informed support, system navigation, and health clinic partnerships, all aimed at addressing the complex needs of women facing barriers to accessing services.\n\nThe foundation's initiatives, such as the Anne Marie D'Amico Day of Kindness and Love and The Turtle Project, further enhance the community's support network, fostering a culture of kindness and resilience. Overall, the collaboration between the Anne Marie D'Amico Foundation and the North York Women's Shelter exemplifies a comprehensive approach to supporting vulnerable populations and creating lasting change in the community.
