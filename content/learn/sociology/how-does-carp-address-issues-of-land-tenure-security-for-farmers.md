    How does CARP address issues of land tenure security for farmers?
answer: >-
    The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in the Philippines was established in 1988 with the primary objective of providing land tenure security to small farmers and farmworkers. This initiative aimed to address historical inequities in land distribution and promote social justice through the redistribution of agricultural lands.\n\n### Key Mechanisms for Addressing Land Tenure Security\n\n1. **Land Acquisition and Distribution**: CARP facilitates the acquisition of agricultural lands from landowners and redistributes them to landless farmers. This process includes compulsory acquisition, where the government can acquire land for redistribution, ensuring that tenant-farmers have the opportunity to gain ownership of the land they cultivate.\n\n2. **Security of Tenure**: Under CARP, tenant-farmers, particularly those on lands less than 5 hectares, are guaranteed security of tenure. This means they cannot be unjustly evicted and have the right to continue farming the land. This provision is crucial for providing stability and encouraging investment in agricultural practices.\n\n3. **Collective Titles and Individual Rights**: While CARP has distributed approximately 4.9 million hectares of land to over 2.8 million farmers, a significant portion of this land (about 2.37 million hectares) was awarded under collective titles. These collective titles have been criticized for not providing full individual property rights, which can undermine the security of tenure for beneficiaries. Efforts are ongoing to convert these collective titles into individual titles to enhance land tenure security.\n\n4. **Support Services**: In addition to land redistribution, CARP aims to provide support services to beneficiaries, including access to capital, marketing support, and infrastructure development. These services are intended to improve the productivity and income of agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs), thereby reinforcing their tenure security through economic stability.\n\n5. **Legal Framework**: The legal basis for CARP is the Republic Act No. 6657, also known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL). This law outlines the mechanisms for land acquisition, distribution, and the protection of the rights of farmers and farmworkers.\n\n### Challenges and Future Directions\n\nDespite its objectives, CARP has faced challenges, including bureaucratic inefficiencies, resistance from landowners, and issues related to the implementation of land titles. The program's effectiveness in providing long-term land tenure security remains a topic of evaluation, especially as it approaches its 30-year mark. Future directions may include reforms to streamline processes, enhance individual property rights, and ensure that support services are effectively delivered to beneficiaries.\n\nIn summary, CARP addresses land tenure security for farmers through a combination of land acquisition, legal protections, and support services, although challenges remain in fully realizing its goals.
