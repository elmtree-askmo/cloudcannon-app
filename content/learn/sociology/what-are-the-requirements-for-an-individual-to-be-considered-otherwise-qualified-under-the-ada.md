    What are the requirements for an individual to be considered 'otherwise qualified' under the ADA?
answer: >-
    To be considered "otherwise qualified" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an individual must meet specific criteria related to their ability to perform the essential functions of a job. Here are the key requirements:\n\n1. **Disability Status**: The individual must have a disability as defined by the ADA. This includes having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\n\n2. **Meeting Job Requirements**: The individual must meet the legitimate skill, experience, education, or other requirements of the employment position they hold or seek. This means they should possess the necessary qualifications for the job.\n\n3. **Ability to Perform Essential Functions**: The individual must be able to perform the essential functions of the job, either with or without reasonable accommodation. Essential functions are the fundamental job duties that an employee must be able to perform, and they are determined by the employer based on the nature of the job.\n\n4. **Reasonable Accommodation**: If the individual cannot perform certain essential functions due to their disability, they may still be considered otherwise qualified if they can perform those functions with a reasonable accommodation. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.\n\n5. **No Undue Hardship**: The employer must demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an undue hardship, which refers to significant difficulty or expense in relation to the size of the business, its resources, and the nature of the operation.\n\nIn summary, an individual is considered "otherwise qualified" under the ADA if they have a disability, meet the job requirements, can perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation, and the employer can accommodate them without incurring undue hardship. This framework ensures that individuals with disabilities have equal opportunities in the workplace while balancing the needs of employers.
