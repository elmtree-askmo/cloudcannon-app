    How have international bodies and countries reacted to the recent Gaza conflict?
answer: >-
    The recent Gaza conflict has elicited a wide range of reactions from international bodies and countries, reflecting deep divisions in global perspectives on the issue. \n\n1. **Western Nations' Response**: Many Western countries, including the United States and several European nations, have condemned the attacks by Hamas and expressed solidarity with Israel. For instance, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unequivocally condemned the Hamas attacks and affirmed Israel's right to defend itself. Similarly, Ukraine's government condemned the terrorist attacks against Israel and expressed support for its right to self-defense.\n\n2. **Middle Eastern and Muslim Countries**: In contrast, countries in the Muslim world have largely expressed support for the Palestinians. The Arab League called for an immediate halt to military operations in Gaza, emphasizing the need to address the root causes of the conflict, which they attribute to the Israeli occupation. The United Arab Emirates urged for maximum restraint and an immediate ceasefire to prevent further escalation.\n\n3. **Public Protests and Movements**: In various countries, public protests have erupted in support of Palestine. For example, in the UK, a significant rally in London attracted around 100,000 participants demanding an end to Israeli bombardments. However, some governments, like that of Germany, have taken steps to ban pro-Palestinian demonstrations, citing concerns over public safety and anti-Semitism.\n\n4. **Boycotts and Direct Actions**: There has been a notable increase in calls for boycotts of Western companies perceived to support Israel, particularly in Muslim-majority countries. Protests have targeted brands like Starbucks and Puma, reflecting widespread anger at Western governments' support for Israel.\n\n5. **Global South's Perspective**: The conflict has highlighted a growing rift between the West and the Global South. Many countries in Latin America and Africa have voiced their discontent with the Western stance, advocating for Palestinian rights and criticizing the disproportionate impact of the conflict on civilians.\n\n6. **UN and Humanitarian Concerns**: The United Nations has been vocal about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with calls for urgent humanitarian pauses to allow aid to reach civilians. The UN General Assembly has held emergency sessions to address the situation, advocating for a ceasefire and the protection of civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law.\n\nOverall, the international reaction to the Gaza conflict underscores a complex interplay of political, social, and humanitarian concerns, with stark contrasts between the responses of Western nations and those of the Global South.
