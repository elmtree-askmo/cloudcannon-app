    What were the main agendas discussed at the SCO meeting concerning India and Pakistan?
answer: >-
    The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings, particularly the recent ones in 2023 and 2024, have highlighted several key agendas concerning India and Pakistan. \n\n1. **Security and Terrorism**: A significant focus of the discussions has been on regional security, with both countries addressing concerns related to terrorism, separatism, and extremism. India has consistently emphasized the need for a cooperative approach to combat these issues, while also advocating for multilateral reforms.\n\n2. **Economic Cooperation**: The SCO meetings have also served as a platform to discuss economic development and connectivity among member states. India has been cautious about endorsing initiatives like China's Belt and Road Initiative, which it views with skepticism due to concerns over sovereignty and regional influence.\n\n3. **Cautious Diplomacy**: The meetings have seen a cautious thaw in India-Pakistan relations, particularly with the attendance of Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari at the SCO Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Goa in May 2023. This marked the first visit by a Pakistani Foreign Minister to India in over a decade, indicating a potential opening for dialogue.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Sensitive Issues**: During these discussions, there were no direct references to contentious issues such as Kashmir from the Pakistani side, while India refrained from specific mentions of Pakistan in the context of cross-border terrorism. This diplomatic restraint suggests a desire to maintain a constructive atmosphere for dialogue.\n\n5. **Regional Stability and Cooperation**: Both countries have expressed the need for stronger regional cooperation in various sectors, including trade and energy. The SCO meetings have provided a platform for India to engage with Pakistan and other member states on these broader issues, despite ongoing bilateral tensions.\n\nOverall, the SCO meetings have been instrumental in facilitating dialogue between India and Pakistan, focusing on shared challenges while navigating sensitive historical issues.
