    How does Durkheim's Structural Functionalism view society?
answer: >-
    Émile Durkheim's Structural Functionalism views society as a complex system composed of interrelated parts that work together to maintain stability and social order. He posited that society functions like an organism, where each component—such as family, religion, education, and economy—plays a crucial role in the overall health and functioning of the social body. This perspective emphasizes that society is greater than the sum of its parts, as the interconnectivity of these elements is essential for the continued existence and evolution of the society.\n\nDurkheim distinguished between two types of social solidarity: mechanical and organic. Mechanical solidarity is characteristic of traditional, small-scale societies where individuals share common values and beliefs, leading to a strong collective consciousness. In contrast, organic solidarity is found in modern, industrial societies, where social cohesion arises from the interdependence of individuals who perform specialized roles. In such societies, the division of labor is more complex, and while the collective consciousness may weaken, social integration is maintained through the recognition of mutual dependencies.\n\nDurkheim also introduced the concept of social integration, which he believed was vital for the health of society. He argued that individuals who are more integrated into their social groups tend to have better mental health and lower suicide rates. This highlights the importance of social ties and collective norms in fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.\n\nOverall, Durkheim's Structural Functionalism underscores the significance of social structures and their functions in promoting stability, cohesion, and integration within society, making it a foundational theory in sociology.
