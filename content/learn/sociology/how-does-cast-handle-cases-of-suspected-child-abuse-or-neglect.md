    How does CAST handle cases of suspected child abuse or neglect?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) handles cases of suspected child abuse or neglect through a structured process that is mandated by the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, 2017. According to Section 125 of this Act, any individual who has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is in need of protection is legally required to report their suspicions to a children's aid society.\n\nWhen a report of suspected abuse or neglect is received, CAST initiates an investigation. This process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**: Upon receiving a report, CAST conducts an initial assessment to determine the validity of the claims and the immediate safety of the child involved.\n\n2. **Investigation**: If the initial assessment indicates that there may be a risk to the child, a more thorough investigation is conducted. This may involve interviews with the child, family members, and other relevant parties. In cases of sexual abuse, the child may be brought to a specialized facility where they receive support throughout the investigation, including emotional support from trained volunteers.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**: In cases where criminal activity is suspected, CAST collaborates with law enforcement agencies to ensure that the investigation is comprehensive and that the child's safety is prioritized.\n\n4. **Reporting to the Child Abuse Registry**: If during the investigation new information suggests that there is a current or prior incident of abuse, CAST is required to file a report with the Child Abuse Registry.\n\n5. **Post-Investigation Support**: Depending on the outcome of the investigation, CAST may provide ongoing support services to the child and family, which can include counseling, foster care, or other interventions aimed at ensuring the child's safety and well-being.\n\nOverall, CAST's approach is guided by a commitment to protecting children and supporting families, while adhering to legal requirements for mandatory reporting and intervention in cases of suspected abuse or neglect.
