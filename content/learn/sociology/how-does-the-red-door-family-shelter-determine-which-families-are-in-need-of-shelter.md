    How does the Red Door Family Shelter determine which families are in need of shelter?
answer: >-
    The Red Door Family Shelter determines which families are in need of shelter through an intake process that includes a needs assessment conducted by a Case Worker. During this assessment, the Case Worker gathers information about the family's situation and immediate needs. This process is crucial in identifying the specific circumstances of each family, allowing the shelter to provide appropriate support and resources.\n\nEligibility for shelter access at the Red Door Family Shelter includes families who are homeless, which encompasses immigrant families awaiting hearings or status, government-sponsored or refugee claimant families, and women with children fleeing domestic abuse. This broad eligibility criterion ensures that the shelter can assist a diverse range of vulnerable populations.\n\nOnce families arrive at the shelter, they are provided with temporary housing and access to various support services aimed at helping them regain stability and independence. The length of stay at the shelter can vary based on individual circumstances and needs, with some families staying for just one night while others may reside there for up to six months. \n\nOverall, the Red Door Family Shelter's approach is designed to address the unique needs of each family, ensuring that those who are most in need receive the support necessary to transition out of homelessness.
