    How do public perceptions of undocumented workers influence immigration policy in Texas?
answer: >-
    Public perceptions of undocumented workers significantly influence immigration policy in Texas, particularly among Republican voters. A combination of factors, including concerns about border security, negative attitudes toward immigration, and the implications of growing ethnic and racial diversity, shapes these perceptions and, consequently, policy decisions.\n\nPolling data from December 2022 indicates that a near majority (49%) of Republicans believe it is important for a person to be born in the United States to be considered "American." This sentiment reflects a broader trend among Republican voters who favor restrictive and punitive immigration policies. The Texas Politics Project has documented that immigration and border security are viewed as top priorities by Texans, with 20% citing border security and 14% immigration as critical issues. Among Republican voters, these figures rise to 37% for border security and 24% for immigration.\n\nThe political landscape in Texas has been heavily influenced by these attitudes, as Republican campaigns have consistently emphasized the importance of border security over the past two decades. This has resulted in a political environment where aggressive enforcement policies are not only supported but are also seen as necessary to align with the views of the electorate. The mutual reinforcement of these attitudes among Texas Republicans and the actions of state leaders, including the Governor, have led to increased funding and support for border security initiatives.\n\nMoreover, the prevalence of negative attitudes toward both legal and illegal immigration has contributed to a push for stricter enforcement of immigration laws. This has been evident in legislative proposals and public discourse, where the focus on border security often overshadows discussions about the economic contributions of undocumented workers.\n\nIn summary, public perceptions of undocumented workers, particularly among Republican voters in Texas, play a crucial role in shaping immigration policy. The emphasis on border security and the desire for restrictive measures reflect a broader concern about national identity and demographic changes, which in turn influences legislative actions and political campaigns in the state.
