    How does the foundation engage with the local community to raise awareness?
answer: >-
    The Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation engages with the local community to raise awareness through several initiatives aimed at combating violence against women and promoting community empowerment. One of the key initiatives is the **Anne Marie D'Amico Community Collective (AMDCC)**, which was launched in September 2021. This collective offers wrap-around services to women in the North York community who have experienced violence, addressing various barriers they face in accessing support services.\n\nIn addition to the AMDCC, the foundation has established legacy projects that keep the issue of violence against women salient in public discourse. These initiatives not only provide direct support but also aim to transform the tragedy of Anne Marie D'Amico's death into a catalyst for community action and awareness.\n\nThe foundation also collaborates with the **North York Women's Shelter**, which provides a range of services including safe shelter, advocacy, and crisis support. This partnership enhances the visibility of the services available to those affected by violence and promotes a collective response to gender-based violence.\n\nFurthermore, the foundation organizes events such as the **Anne Marie D’Amico Day of Kindness and Love**, which serves to honor Anne Marie's legacy while fostering community spirit and encouraging individuals to engage in acts of kindness. This day not only raises awareness but also mobilizes community members to participate in supportive actions.\n\nOverall, the foundation's multifaceted approach—combining direct support services, community engagement initiatives, and awareness-raising events—plays a crucial role in addressing violence against women and fostering a supportive community environment.
