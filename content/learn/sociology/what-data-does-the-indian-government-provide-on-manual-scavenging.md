    What data does the Indian government provide on manual scavenging?
answer: >-
    The Indian government has provided various data and reports regarding manual scavenging, a practice that involves the manual removal of human excreta from dry latrines and the cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. Despite the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which bans this practice, it continues to persist in various forms.\n\n1. **Surveys and Identification**: The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has conducted two significant surveys in 2013 and 2018 to identify manual scavengers. According to these surveys, approximately 58,098 individuals were identified as manual scavengers as of 2018. A more recent survey under the NAMASTE scheme indicated that around 38,000 workers involved in hazardous cleaning across urban areas belong to marginalized communities, primarily Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), or Other Backward Classes (OBC).\n\n2. **Demographics**: It is estimated that about 97% of manual scavengers in India are Dalits, with a significant number being women. The work is often characterized by the use of rudimentary tools and poses severe health risks.\n\n3. **Fatalities**: The government has reported that since 1993, approximately 941 individuals have died due to accidents while engaged in hazardous cleaning tasks. However, there are discrepancies in reporting, as some recent statements claim no deaths have been reported due to manual scavenging itself, although deaths related to sewer cleaning accidents have been documented.\n\n4. **Government Initiatives**: The Indian government has initiated various programs aimed at the rehabilitation and empowerment of manual scavengers. This includes skill development training and financial assistance through schemes like the National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) and the Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers.\n\n5. **Legislative Framework**: The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is the primary legislation aimed at abolishing manual scavenging. It prohibits the employment of individuals in this capacity and outlines penalties for contravening the law.\n\nOverall, while the Indian government has made efforts to address the issue of manual scavenging through legislation and surveys, the practice remains a significant social challenge, deeply intertwined with caste-based discrimination and economic disparities.
