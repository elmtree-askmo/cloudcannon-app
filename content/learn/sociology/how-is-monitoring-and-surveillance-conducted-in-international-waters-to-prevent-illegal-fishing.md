    How is monitoring and surveillance conducted in international waters to prevent illegal fishing?
answer: >-
    Monitoring and surveillance in international waters to prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a multifaceted approach that combines advanced technology, international cooperation, and robust regulatory frameworks. Here are the key components involved in this process:\n\n1. **National Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) Systems**: Countries establish and operate MCS systems to gather information on fisheries and fishers. These systems are crucial for setting and enforcing rules regarding fishing practices. Effective MCS is essential for combating IUU fishing, as it allows for real-time monitoring of fishing activities.\n\n2. **International Cooperation**: Given the global nature of IUU fishing, international collaboration is vital. The International Monitoring Control and Surveillance Network facilitates cooperation among countries to share information and strategies to combat IUU fishing. This network helps in coordinating efforts and resources to enhance surveillance capabilities.\n\n3. **Technological Tools**: Various technologies are employed to monitor fishing activities:\n   - **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**: This technology is effective for detecting fishing vessels in vast ocean areas.\n   - **Optical Imagery**: Used for recognizing vessels and correlating their activities with data from Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT).\n   - **Artificial Intelligence**: Organizations like Global Fishing Watch utilize AI to analyze satellite images and monitor fishing activities, helping to identify patterns of illegal fishing.\n\n4. **Joint Analytical Cell**: This initiative aims to enhance fisheries monitoring and control by analyzing data from various sources to identify IUU fishing activities. It plays a critical role in understanding the scale and impact of illegal fishing on global economies and marine ecosystems.\n\n5. **Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA)**: This treaty, which came into force in 2016, establishes international rules for port states to verify catches landed in their ports. It aims to prevent IUU fishing by ensuring that only legally caught fish can enter ports, thereby closing off a significant avenue for illegal activities.\n\n6. **Capacity Building**: Efforts are also focused on building the capacity of countries to sustainably manage their fisheries resources. This includes improving governance and regulatory frameworks to enhance compliance with international fishing standards.\n\n7. **Challenges in Enforcement**: Despite technological advancements, enforcement remains challenging due to overlapping technologies and data streams, which can complicate the identification of effective solutions. Additionally, poor ocean governance and harmful subsidies can exacerbate the problem of IUU fishing.\n\nIn summary, monitoring and surveillance in international waters to combat IUU fishing involves a combination of advanced technologies, international cooperation, and regulatory frameworks. These efforts are crucial for protecting marine ecosystems, supporting local communities, and ensuring sustainable fisheries management.
