    What were the main goals and achievements of the Self-Respect Movement?
answer: >-
    The Self-Respect Movement, founded in 1925 by E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (commonly known as Periyar), emerged as a significant social reform movement in South India, particularly in Tamil Nadu. Its primary goals and achievements can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Main Goals:\n1. **Social Equality**: The movement aimed to achieve social equality for the oppressed classes, particularly those marginalized by the Indian caste system. It sought to empower lower castes and encourage them to develop self-respect.\n2. **Abolition of Brahminical Hegemony**: The movement rejected the dominance of Brahminical culture and religion, which Periyar viewed as tools of exploitation. It advocated for the dismantling of the caste system and the establishment of a rational society free from religious and caste-based discrimination.\n3. **Women's Rights**: The Self-Respect Movement held deeply feminist values, promoting women's rights over their physical, sexual, and reproductive choices. It aimed to liberate gender relationships from Brahminical patriarchy.\n4. **Cultural and Educational Empowerment**: The movement encouraged backward classes to value themselves and aimed to provide them with equal access to education and opportunities, fostering a sense of pride and identity.\n\n### Key Achievements:\n1. **Political Impact**: The Self-Respect Movement laid the groundwork for the Dravidian Movement, which significantly influenced political governance in Tamil Nadu. It contributed to the rise of political parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which have dominated the state's politics for decades.\n2. **Social Reforms**: The movement played a crucial role in advocating for various social reforms, including legal protections for self-respect marriages and reservations for backward classes in education and employment.\n3. **Cultural Renaissance**: It sparked a cultural renaissance among the Dravidian people, promoting Tamil language and literature, and fostering a sense of pride in their identity.\n4. **Legacy of Rationalism**: The movement emphasized rationalism and self-respect as essential components for overcoming ignorance and fear, promoting a more enlightened and progressive society.\n\nOverall, the Self-Respect Movement was a transformative force in Indian society, particularly in Tamil Nadu, advocating for the rights and dignity of marginalized communities and challenging the entrenched social hierarchies of the time.
