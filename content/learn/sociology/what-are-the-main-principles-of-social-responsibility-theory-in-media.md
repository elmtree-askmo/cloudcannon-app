answer: >-
    The Social Responsibility Theory in media is a crucial concept that emphasizes the obligations of media organizations to act in the public interest. Here are the main principles of this theory:\n\n1. **Obligation to Society**: Media should accept and fulfill certain obligations to society, which includes providing accurate, fair, and balanced information. This principle underscores the idea that media has a duty to serve the public good.\n\n2. **Public Interest**: The media's primary role is to inform citizens and foster democratic discourse. This involves not only reporting news but also contributing to the social good by promoting informed public participation in democratic processes.\n\n3. **Accountability**: While freedom of the press is essential, it must be accompanied by accountability to society. This means that journalists and media organizations should act ethically and responsibly in their reporting, ensuring that their work does not harm the public.\n\n4. **High Professional Standards**: Media organizations are expected to adhere to high professional standards, which includes ethical reporting practices and a commitment to truthfulness and objectivity.\n\n5. **Diversity of Voices**: The media should ensure that all voices are heard and considered, promoting pluralism and diversity in news coverage. This principle is vital for representing the varied perspectives within society.\n\n6. **Avoiding Harm**: Media outlets should strive to avoid causing harm, particularly in sensitive reporting areas such as health news or during emergencies. This includes being mindful of the potential impacts of their reporting on individuals and communities.\n\n7. **Fostering Social Welfare**: The media should contribute to social welfare by addressing issues that affect the community and providing information that can lead to positive social change.\n\nThese principles collectively highlight the balance that media must strike between exercising freedom of expression and fulfilling its responsibilities to society. The Social Responsibility Theory serves as a guiding framework for ethical journalism and media practices.
