    What were the main sanitary conditions and health concerns in Johannesburg's slum-yards?
answer: >-
    In Johannesburg's slum-yards, the main sanitary conditions and health concerns were characterized by severe overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and a lack of basic services. These slum conditions were prevalent in the inner city, where many African workers lived in makeshift yards and compounds. The municipality's failure to provide adequate housing and essential services exacerbated these issues, leading to significant public health crises.\n\nKey health concerns included:\n\n1. **Overcrowding**: The slum-yards were often densely populated, which facilitated the rapid spread of infectious diseases. The close quarters made it difficult for residents to maintain personal hygiene and sanitation.\n\n2. **Inadequate Sanitation**: Many slum-yards lacked proper waste disposal systems and clean water supply. This resulted in unsanitary living conditions that contributed to the proliferation of diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever.\n\n3. **Public Health Crises**: The poor living conditions in the slum-yards were linked to various public health issues. The municipality's neglect in addressing these conditions led to outbreaks of diseases, which were often framed within racial narratives that portrayed African populations as sources of disease and crime. This narrative was used to justify stricter segregation policies and the removal of African residents from urban areas.\n\n4. **Landlord Exploitation**: Many residents faced exploitation from landlords who took advantage of the desperate housing situation. This often resulted in further deterioration of living conditions, as landlords neglected maintenance and sanitation in their properties.\n\nOverall, the sanitary conditions in Johannesburg's slum-yards were dire, and the associated health concerns highlighted the contradictions between the official segregationist policies and the realities faced by African populations living in these urban environments.
