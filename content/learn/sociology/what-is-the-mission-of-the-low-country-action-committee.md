    The mission of the Lowcountry Action Committee (LAC) is centered around Black liberation through various means, including service, political education, and collective action within the Lowcountry region. As a Black-led grassroots organization, LAC is dedicated to addressing and combating institutional racism while also advocating for the self-determination of Black communities. \n\nIn addition to its primary focus on racial justice, the organization recognizes the interconnectedness of various forms of oppression, including sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia. LAC aims to defend the human rights of all individuals who are unjustly oppressed, emphasizing a holistic approach to social justice.\n\nFurthermore, LAC is involved in community programs, such as the Freedom Bag Drive, which reflects its commitment to serving the local community and addressing immediate needs. Overall, the organization seeks to empower the historically Black Eastside community of Charleston and promote collective action for social change.
