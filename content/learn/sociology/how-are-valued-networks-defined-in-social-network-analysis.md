    How are valued networks defined in social network analysis?
answer: >-
    In social network analysis, valued networks are defined as networks in which each link (or tie) between nodes (individuals or entities) is assigned a numerical value that represents the strength or intensity of the relationship. These values typically range from 0, indicating a non-existent link, to 1, which signifies the strongest possible link. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of relationships compared to binary networks, where ties are simply classified as either present or absent.\n\nValued networks provide richer data, enabling researchers to analyze the dynamics of relationships more effectively. For instance, in a study network, the values assigned to ties could reflect the frequency of interactions, such as the number of weekly phone calls between friends or the amount of time spent studying together. This added complexity allows for deeper insights into how relationships influence behaviors and outcomes, such as peer impact on learning gains.\n\nOverall, valued networks are crucial for understanding the varying degrees of connection and influence among nodes, making them an important aspect of social network analysis.
