    What is the current situation in Manipur regarding the internet ban and violence?
answer: >-
    As of October 2023, the situation in Manipur regarding the internet ban and violence remains tense. The Manipur government has extended the ban on internet services multiple times in response to ongoing violence and unrest in the state. Most recently, the internet ban was extended until October 21, with officials citing the need to curb the activities of anti-social elements and maintain law and order as the primary reasons for this decision.\n\nThe violence in Manipur, which began on May 3, has resulted in significant casualties and unrest, with reports indicating that at least 30 people have been killed in ethnic clashes. The conflict primarily involves the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, leading to widespread violence and the displacement of thousands of residents. In response to the escalating violence, the government has imposed curfews in various districts and restricted gatherings to prevent further unrest.\n\nIn addition to the internet ban, the government has taken measures to control the spread of misinformation, which is believed to exacerbate tensions. While some areas have seen a partial lifting of restrictions, the overall situation remains precarious, with ongoing concerns about law and order in the region. The government continues to monitor the situation closely, and further extensions of the internet ban may occur if violence persists.
