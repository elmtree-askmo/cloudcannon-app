    How do hierarchy and gendered power relations manifest in institutional culture?
answer: >-
    Hierarchy and gendered power relations manifest in institutional culture through various mechanisms that shape decision-making processes, access to resources, and the overall dynamics within organizations. The concept of gendered power dynamics is crucial in understanding how institutions operate, as these dynamics frame the relationships and interactions among individuals within the hierarchy.\n\n1. **Decision-Making and Access**: Gendered power dynamics influence who gets to make decisions and who has access to influential positions within institutions. As noted by Mackay et al. (2010), the power relations that sustain political processes are produced and reproduced through gender, indicating that institutional hierarchies often reflect and reinforce existing gender inequalities.\n\n2. **Institutional Change**: Incorporating gender dynamics into institutional analyses enhances our understanding of institutional change. Recognizing that power relations are gendered allows for a more nuanced view of how institutions evolve and adapt. This perspective highlights the importance of power in institutional change, which has often been overlooked in traditional analyses (Mackay et al., 2010).\n\n3. **Cultural Influences**: Informal institutions, which are deeply rooted in culture and traditions, significantly contribute to gender bias. The cultural context shapes the expectations and behaviors of individuals within institutions, often perpetuating gender inequalities. For instance, male-dominated cultures in higher education organizations can create environments that sustain gender inequality (Iyer et al., 2007; Apriyanto, 2018).\n\n4. **Gendered Institutions**: Institutions can be seen as gendered entities that constrain and enable human agency. This perspective emphasizes the need to study the gendered nature of institutions and their effects on individuals, particularly in terms of power dynamics and institutional norms (Fletcher, 2017).\n\n5. **Representation and Quotas**: Despite increasing participation of women in the workforce, there remains a significant gender gap in power within organizations. Initiatives such as gender audits and quotas have been implemented in various countries to address this imbalance, yet the effectiveness of these measures can vary based on the institutional culture and the underlying power dynamics (Catalyst, 2010).\n\nIn summary, hierarchy and gendered power relations are deeply intertwined within institutional culture, influencing decision-making, access to power, and the overall dynamics of organizations. Understanding these relationships is essential for fostering gender-sensitive institutional change and addressing the persistent inequalities that exist in various sectors.
