    What is the current state of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes in India?
answer: >-
    As of 2022, the state of atrocities against Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India remains a significant concern. According to a report released by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, there were 51,656 reported cases of atrocities against SCs and 9,735 against STs. Alarmingly, 97.7% of the cases involving SCs and 98.91% of those involving STs were concentrated in just 13 states, indicating a severe regional disparity in the prevalence of such incidents.\n\nThe report highlights that despite the existence of constitutional safeguards and specific legislation, such as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, caste-based violence continues to be a pervasive issue in Indian society. The data indicates a slight increase in reported cases, with atrocities against Dalits rising by 1.2% from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThe ongoing violence and discrimination against SCs and STs reflect deep-rooted social issues that challenge the principles of social justice and equality in India. Advocacy for the rights of these marginalized groups remains crucial, as they continue to face systemic discrimination and violence despite legal protections.\n\nIn summary, the current state of atrocities against SCs and STs in India is alarming, with a high number of cases reported and concentrated in specific regions, underscoring the need for continued efforts to address these injustices and protect the rights of marginalized communities.
