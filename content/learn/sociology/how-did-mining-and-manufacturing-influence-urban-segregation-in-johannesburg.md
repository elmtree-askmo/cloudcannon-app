    How did mining and manufacturing influence urban segregation in Johannesburg?
answer: >-
    Mining and manufacturing significantly influenced urban segregation in Johannesburg, particularly during the early 20th century. The mining boom that began in the late 19th century attracted a diverse workforce, including a substantial number of African laborers, leading to a period of relative racial integration in the inner city. This initial integration was largely driven by the economic demands of the mining and manufacturing sectors, which required a large labor force to support their operations.\n\nHowever, as the city grew and the economic landscape evolved, the dynamics of urban segregation began to shift. The economic interests of white ratepayers and segregationist groups became more pronounced, leading to systematic efforts to segregate African workers from white populations. This shift was institutionalized through legislation such as the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923, which aimed to control the settlement patterns of African populations and enforce residential separation.\n\nThe competition for resources and housing between different racial groups intensified as the mining and manufacturing sectors continued to thrive. White constituencies, including manufacturers and working-class ratepayers, began to advocate for policies that would protect their economic interests and property values. This resulted in a transition from initially supporting African housing to vilifying the so-called 'African slum problem,' which justified the removal of African communities from certain areas and the enforcement of stricter segregation policies.\n\nMoreover, the poor living conditions in slum-yards, characterized by overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, were often framed within a racial discourse that portrayed African populations as sources of disease and crime. This narrative further legitimized the push for segregation and reinforced the socio-economic divides within the city.\n\nIn summary, the interplay between mining and manufacturing interests and the socio-political landscape of Johannesburg led to the institutionalization of urban segregation. Initially fostering a racially integrated workforce, the economic pressures and legislative frameworks ultimately resulted in a divided urban environment, reflecting broader power struggles and racial ideologies that shaped the city's development.
