    How does the public typically respond to tsunami warnings in California?
answer: >-
    The public response to tsunami warnings in California can vary significantly based on the circumstances surrounding the warning, as evidenced by the recent tsunami warning issued after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Humboldt County. \n\nIn this instance, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tsunami warning that affected approximately 5.3 million people. The response from local authorities and the public was mixed. For example, in Berkeley, emergency services evacuated certain areas, while in San Francisco, officials utilized social media and alerts to advise residents to stay away from water, beaches, harbors, marina docks, and piers. This indicates a proactive approach in some areas, where local emergency services took immediate action to ensure public safety.\n\nHowever, there was also confusion and uncertainty among residents regarding the appropriate response to the warning. Many individuals expressed frustration and anger, as the region does not frequently experience tsunami alerts, leading to questions about the validity and seriousness of the warning. In San Mateo County, officials opted not to sound tsunami warning sirens after receiving updated information indicating that any potential tsunami would primarily affect coastlines north of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nOverall, the public's response to tsunami warnings in California is influenced by the perceived credibility of the warning, the clarity of communication from local authorities, and past experiences with similar events. The recent warning highlighted the need for effective emergency notification systems and public education on how to respond to such alerts, especially in a region where tsunami warnings are relatively rare.
