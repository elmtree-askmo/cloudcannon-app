    How has public opinion on mass surveillance changed over time?
answer: >-
    Public opinion on mass surveillance has undergone significant changes over time, particularly following the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. Prior to these disclosures, awareness and concern about government surveillance were relatively low among the general public. However, the Snowden leaks exposed the extensive nature of surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies, fundamentally altering public perception.\n\nAccording to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center shortly after the Snowden revelations, about 49% of Americans believed that the release of classified information served the public interest, while 44% felt it harmed it. This indicates a divided opinion on the implications of mass surveillance. Additionally, 34% of those aware of government surveillance programs reported taking steps to protect their privacy, such as changing privacy settings on social media.\n\nOver the years, as awareness of surveillance practices has increased, so too have concerns about privacy and civil liberties. A significant majority of Americans now express that privacy-related values are important to them, with many indicating that they have changed their technology usage behaviors due to awareness of federal surveillance programs. For instance, 87% of Americans are aware of these programs, and among those, a notable percentage have adjusted their online behaviors.\n\nThe evolution of technology and the growing capabilities of surveillance methods have also contributed to a heightened public discourse on the balance between security and individual rights. As noted by scholars like Shoshana Zuboff, the commodification of personal data and the pervasive nature of surveillance have raised alarms about personal autonomy and democracy.\n\nIn summary, public opinion on mass surveillance has shifted from a general lack of awareness and concern to a more informed and critical stance, particularly in the wake of the Snowden revelations. This change reflects broader societal debates about privacy, security, and the role of government in monitoring citizens.
