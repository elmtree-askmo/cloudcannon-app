    Why have narrative studies been largely absent from studies of terrorist narratives?
answer: >-
    Narrative studies have been largely absent from the analysis of terrorist narratives for several reasons, primarily linked to the historical disconnect between literary studies and terrorism research. As noted by Glazzard (2017), the lack of engagement with narrative theory in the context of terrorism has resulted in a significant gap in understanding how terrorist communications function as narratives. This absence undermines the ability to analyze these communications effectively, as they often contain complex structures and meanings that are best understood through a literary lens.\n\nMoreover, while social scientists have focused on the role of narratives in the radicalization process, there has been insufficient integration of narrative analysis into the broader discourse on counter-terrorism. The existing literature tends to emphasize the propagandistic use of narratives by terrorist organizations without adequately exploring the narrative techniques employed or the implications for counter-narrative strategies. For instance, terrorist narratives are often characterized by their simplicity and emotional resonance, which makes them compelling to target audiences. This suggests that counter-narrative efforts must also adopt similar narrative strategies to be effective, yet this approach has not been fully realized in current research.\n\nAdditionally, the fragmented nature of the literature on violent extremism, which spans multiple disciplines, has contributed to the oversight of narrative studies. While there is a growing recognition of the importance of narratives in counter-radicalization efforts, the systematic analysis of terrorist narratives remains underdeveloped. This gap indicates a need for more interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between literary studies and terrorism research, to enhance the understanding of how narratives shape perceptions and behaviors related to violent extremism.\n\nIn summary, the absence of narrative studies in the analysis of terrorist narratives can be attributed to a historical disconnect between relevant academic fields, a focus on the propagandistic aspects of narratives without deeper literary analysis, and the fragmented nature of the existing literature. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the effectiveness of counter-narrative strategies in combating violent extremism.
