answer: >-
    Judgment or purposive sampling, also known as judgmental sampling, is a non-probability sampling technique where the researcher selects participants based on their knowledge and judgment regarding who would be most informative for the study. This method is particularly useful when the researcher aims to focus on specific characteristics or qualifications that are relevant to the research objectives.\n\n### When to Use Judgment or Purposive Sampling\n\n1. **Qualitative Research**: Purposive sampling is most appropriate in qualitative research where the goal is to gain a detailed and nuanced understanding of specific phenomena rather than to generalize findings to a larger population. It allows researchers to select cases that are particularly informative.\n\n2. **Specific Subsets**: This method is ideal when the researcher wants to access a particular subset of the population that shares certain characteristics. For example, if a study is focused on the experiences of individuals with a rare medical condition, purposive sampling would allow the researcher to select participants who meet this specific criterion.\n\n3. **Limited Data Sources**: Purposive sampling can be effective when there are limited numbers of people who can serve as primary data sources due to the nature of the research design and objectives. This is often the case in specialized fields or niche studies.\n\n4. **Expert Opinions**: It is also used when the researcher seeks to gather insights from experts or individuals with specialized knowledge relevant to the research topic.\n\n### Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nWhile purposive sampling can provide rich, detailed data, it is important to note that it is not without its limitations. The main disadvantage is the potential for bias, as the selection of participants is based on the researcher's judgment, which may not be representative of the broader population. Consequently, purposive sampling is less popular in quantitative research and business studies, where more reliable and less biased methods, such as quota, cluster, or systematic sampling, are often recommended.\n\nIn summary, judgment or purposive sampling is a valuable technique in qualitative research contexts where specific insights are needed from targeted groups or individuals. However, researchers should be cautious of its limitations regarding bias and representativeness.
