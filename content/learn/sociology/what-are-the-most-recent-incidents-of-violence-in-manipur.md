    What are the most recent incidents of violence in Manipur?
answer: >-
    Since May 2023, Manipur has been experiencing severe ethnic violence primarily between the Meitei community, which resides in the valley, and the Kuki-Zo groups located in the hills. This ongoing conflict has led to significant casualties and displacement, with reports indicating that at least 77 Kukis and 10 Meiteis were killed during the initial week of violence. By mid-May, the government reported a total of 73 deaths, 243 injuries, and extensive property damage, including 1,809 houses burned down and over 46,000 people evacuated to relief camps.\n\nRecent incidents have escalated tensions further, with mobs targeting the homes and properties of political leaders in Imphal East and Imphal West. A shoot-at-sight order was issued in response to the violence, which has included vandalism and clashes between the two communities. Notably, a viral video surfaced in July showing two Kuki women being stripped and assaulted, which drew widespread condemnation and led to arrests. The Supreme Court of India intervened, warning that it would take action if the government failed to respond adequately.\n\nAs of late October 2023, violence has continued, with reports of fresh clashes resulting in additional casualties. For instance, at least two people died and over 50 were injured in recent confrontations, and a gunfight on a Monday resulted in 13 fatalities. The situation remains volatile, with ongoing protests and a heavy security presence in the region.\n\nThe conflict has deep historical roots, exacerbated by political decisions and demographic tensions, and has raised serious concerns regarding human rights and governance in the region. The Union government has also expressed concerns about the involvement of Myanmar-based insurgent groups exploiting the ethnic clashes to further their agendas.
