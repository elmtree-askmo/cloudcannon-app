    What are the evaluation criteria for Fairwork India Ratings 2024?
answer: >-
    The Fairwork India Ratings 2024 evaluate labor conditions in the platform economy by assessing various criteria that reflect the working standards of gig economy platforms. The report, which is the sixth consecutive annual study conducted by the Fairwork India Team in collaboration with Oxford University, focuses on the digitally mediated work conditions of app-based workers in India.\n\nThe evaluation criteria for the Fairwork India Ratings 2024 include:\n\n1. **Fair Pay**: This criterion assesses whether platforms provide a local living wage to workers after accounting for work-related costs. The report highlights that many platforms struggle to meet this standard, resulting in low wages and unstable earnings for workers.\n\n2. **Fair Conditions**: This evaluates the working conditions provided by the platforms, including safety measures and the overall work environment.\n\n3. **Fair Contracts**: This criterion examines the transparency and fairness of contracts offered to workers, ensuring that they are not exploitative and that workers understand their rights and obligations.\n\n4. **Fair Management**: This assesses how platforms manage their workforce, including communication, support, and grievance mechanisms.\n\n5. **Fair Representation**: This evaluates whether workers have a voice in decision-making processes and whether there are mechanisms for collective bargaining.\n\nThe report indicates that no platform scored above 6 out of 10, reflecting significant gaps in adherence to these labor standards. The evaluation involved data collection through desk research and interviews with a substantial number of workers, providing a comprehensive view of the labor conditions across major platforms like BigBasket, Swiggy, Urban Company, and Zomato.\n\nFor further details on the specific thresholds for each principle and the criteria used to assess the collected evidence, one would need to refer to the appendix of the Fairwork India Ratings 2024 report.
