    How do communicative strategies like nomination and restriction function in a dialogue?
answer: >-
    In dialogue, communicative strategies such as nomination and restriction play crucial roles in shaping the flow and effectiveness of conversation.\n\n1. **Nomination**: This strategy involves clearly introducing a topic in a truthful and relevant manner. It serves as a way to initiate discussion and can be particularly effective when the topic does not arise naturally from previous exchanges. For example, a speaker might start a conversation by asking, "Have you heard about the new project at work?" This approach not only sets the stage for the conversation but also invites the listener to engage with the topic, fostering an open environment for opinions and further discussion.\n\n2. **Restriction**: This strategy constrains a listener's response within specific categories or parameters. It is often used to guide the conversation and ensure that responses remain relevant to the topic at hand. For instance, a speaker might say, "What do you think about the new policy? Please share your thoughts on its impact on our team." By framing the question this way, the speaker limits the scope of the response, making it easier to maintain focus and coherence in the dialogue.\n\nTogether, these strategies enhance communicative competence by ensuring that conversations are purposeful and engaging. They help speakers achieve their speech objectives while enriching the overall communication experience for both parties involved. By effectively using nomination to introduce topics and restriction to guide responses, speakers can facilitate a more structured and meaningful dialogue.
