    How did Sabu Varghese become involved in smuggling activities?
answer: >-
    Sabu Varghese, also known as Kunjumon, became involved in smuggling activities during his early years, specifically until 1996. He was part of a gang that engaged in the illegal trade of forest produce, including valuable items such as cinnamon bark and sandalwood, primarily in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Kerala, India. His involvement in these activities led to a significant number of criminal cases against him, totaling around 15 by the time he was 23 years old.\n\nHowever, Sabu's life took a transformative turn when he joined the ExVayana Bark Collectors Eco Development Committee (EDC) in Thekkady. This shift marked the beginning of his dedication to wildlife conservation and the protection of the forests he once exploited. He became a key figure in anti-smuggling operations and played a crucial role in initiatives aimed at preventing poaching and illegal trade in the PTR. His efforts have not only contributed to conservation but also helped reintegrate other former smugglers into society through programs like 'Vidiyal,' which promotes eco-tourism.\n\nSabu Varghese's inspiring journey from a smuggler to a conservationist has been recognized with awards, including the prestigious Cricketers for Wildlife Conservation Service Award, highlighting his commitment to environmental protection and sustainable practices.
