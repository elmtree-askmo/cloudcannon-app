    How does territorialisation of antagonism manifest in political violence and ethnic nationalism?
answer: >-
    The territorialisation of antagonism in political violence and ethnic nationalism manifests through a deliberate process of creating and maintaining homogeneous enclaves that exclude and erase the presence of diversity and alterity. This process is often characterized by the destruction of urban environments, a phenomenon referred to as "urbicide." Urbicide involves the systematic demolition of buildings and public spaces that embody shared histories and cultural identities, thereby facilitating the transformation of pluralistic communities into segregated, antagonistic territories.\n\n1. **Transformation of Plurality into Homogeneity**: Ethnic nationalism seeks to deny the existence of difference by promoting a singular ethnic identity. This is achieved through the territorialisation of identity, where urban spaces are reconfigured to reflect and reinforce a homogeneous narrative. For instance, during conflicts such as the Bosnian War, the destruction of significant cultural landmarks, like the Stari Most (Old Bridge) in Mostar, symbolized efforts to erase the pluralistic identity of the city and replace it with a narrative that supports ethnic division.\n\n2. **Re-territorialisation of Antagonism**: The dynamics of political violence necessitate a continual re-territorialisation of antagonism. This means that the antagonistic relationships between different ethnic groups must be actively maintained through acts of violence and destruction. The ongoing destruction of shared public spaces serves to reinforce boundaries that separate groups, creating "dead zones" that inhibit any form of commonality or interaction. This process is not merely about physical separation but also about the ideological and cultural disavowal of the heterogeneity that exists within these territories.\n\n3. **Urbicide as a Political Strategy**: Urbicide is employed as a strategic tool by exclusionary political forces to assert control over urban spaces. By targeting the built environment, these forces aim to eliminate the shared spatiality that allows for coexistence and interaction among diverse groups. The destruction of public artifacts and communal spaces is a means of asserting dominance and legitimizing the narrative of ethnic purity, which is central to the ideology of ethnic nationalism.\n\n4. **Impact on Identity and Community**: The territorialisation of antagonism through urbicide not only affects the physical landscape but also has profound implications for community identity and social relations. The erasure of shared spaces leads to a fragmentation of social networks and a loss of collective memory, further entrenching divisions and fostering an environment of hostility and mistrust among different ethnic groups.\n\nIn summary, the territorialisation of antagonism in political violence and ethnic nationalism is manifested through urbicide, which serves to create and maintain homogeneous enclaves by systematically destroying the built environment that supports diversity and shared identity. This process reinforces the ideological underpinnings of ethnic nationalism, perpetuating cycles of violence and exclusion.
