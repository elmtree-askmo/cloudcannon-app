    How does Saville-Troike's perspective on communicative competence emphasize contextual knowledge and interactional skills?
answer: >-
    Saville-Troike's perspective on communicative competence emphasizes the importance of contextual knowledge and interactional skills by categorizing communicative competence into three essential types of knowledge: linguistic, interactional, and cultural. This framework builds upon the foundational ideas introduced by Dell Hymes, who originally conceptualized communicative competence as the ability to use language appropriately in various social contexts.\n\n1. **Linguistic Knowledge**: This aspect refers to the understanding of language rules, vocabulary, and grammar. However, Saville-Troike expands this definition to include linguistic features that convey social messages, highlighting that language is not just a set of rules but also a tool for social interaction.\n\n2. **Interactional Knowledge**: This component focuses on the skills necessary for effective interaction. Saville-Troike argues that communicative competence is not solely an individual trait but is jointly constructed through interaction. This means that understanding how to engage in conversations, recognize turn-taking, and respond appropriately to others is crucial for successful communication. The dynamics of speech within interactions are essential, as they shape how messages are conveyed and understood.\n\n3. **Cultural Knowledge**: This aspect underscores the significance of understanding the cultural context in which communication occurs. Saville-Troike emphasizes that communicative competence involves awareness of cultural norms, values, and expectations that influence how language is used in different social settings. This cultural knowledge allows individuals to navigate social interactions more effectively and to interpret the meanings behind words and actions within specific cultural frameworks.\n\nOverall, Saville-Troike's perspective highlights that communicative competence is a multifaceted construct that requires not only linguistic proficiency but also a deep understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which communication takes place. This approach recognizes that effective communication is a collaborative process that relies on the interactional skills of all participants involved.
