    What are the ontopolitical claims related to ethnic nationalism and identity?
answer: >-
    The ontopolitical claims related to ethnic nationalism and identity are deeply intertwined with concepts of territory, identity, and the exclusion of difference. Ethnic nationalism posits that identity is fundamentally derived from an exclusive relationship with a specific territory, which is often framed as a natural and pre-existing condition of human existence. This perspective leads to several key ontopolitical assertions:\n\n1. **Territorial Sovereignty**: Ethnic nationalism claims that certain ethnic groups possess a right to territorial sovereignty based on their perceived historical and cultural ties to a specific land. This claim is often justified through an appeal to an origin, suggesting that these groups are inherently entitled to the land they occupy, which is viewed as a natural extension of their identity.\n\n2. **Homogeneity and Exclusion**: The ontopolitical framework of ethnic nationalism seeks to create and maintain homogeneity within a defined territory. This involves the exclusion or eradication of differences—whether cultural, ethnic, or social—that do not conform to the dominant identity. The logic here is that a shared identity is essential for the integrity and stability of the nation-state, leading to practices that marginalize or eliminate minority groups.\n\n3. **Metaphysical Idealism**: Ethnic nationalism often appeals to a metaphysical ideal that posits ethnicity as a fundamental human attribute. This ideal suggests that individuals are naturally inclined to aggregate with others of the same ethnic background, and any deviation from this is viewed as an artificial constraint on human existence. This perspective reinforces the notion that ethnic identity is not only a social construct but a pre-existing condition that must be respected and preserved.\n\n4. **Urbicide and the Built Environment**: The ontopolitical claims of ethnic nationalism manifest in the destruction of urban spaces that embody heterogeneity. Urbicide, or the deliberate destruction of urban environments, is a tactic used by ethnic nationalists to erase traces of alterity and assert their claim over a territory. This destruction is seen as a means to ungather the world, reinforcing the idea that the built environment must reflect the homogeneity of the ethnic group in power.\n\n5. **Existential Heterogeneity**: Ethnic nationalism's ontopolitical claims run counter to the existential heterogeneity of urban spaces. The built environment often reveals the shared and diverse nature of human existence, which ethnic nationalism seeks to deny. By attempting to ground identity in a singular, possessive relationship with territory, ethnic nationalism overlooks the complex relational networks that characterize urban life.\n\nIn summary, the ontopolitical claims of ethnic nationalism are characterized by a desire for territorial sovereignty based on a perceived natural identity, a drive for homogeneity that excludes difference, and a metaphysical grounding that seeks to erase the complexities of shared existence. These claims not only shape political landscapes but also have profound implications for urban environments and the communities that inhabit them.
