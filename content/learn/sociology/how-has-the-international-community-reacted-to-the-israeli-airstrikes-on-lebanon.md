    How has the international community reacted to the Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon?
answer: >-
    The international community has reacted with significant concern to the Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, particularly in light of the escalating humanitarian crisis and the potential for broader regional conflict. Various leaders and organizations have expressed their apprehensions regarding the situation.\n\n1. **United Nations Involvement**: UN representatives have been actively engaged on the ground, advocating for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The UN has highlighted the severe humanitarian implications of the airstrikes, which have impeded civilians' ability to flee violence and disrupted humanitarian operations. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued urgent appeals for aid, emphasizing the need to support both Lebanese citizens and refugees affected by the conflict.\n\n2. **Statements from World Leaders**: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly condemned the killing of civilians, particularly women and children, in Lebanon, calling it "extraordinarily concerning." He urged both Israel and Hezbollah to de-escalate their hostilities. Similarly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed a desire for peace, asserting that Israel is the party seeking to escalate the conflict.\n\n3. **Human Rights Organizations**: Human Rights Watch has criticized the Israeli military actions, stating that the airstrikes threaten considerable civilian harm by making critical border crossings inaccessible during a time of mass displacement. This has raised alarms about the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Lebanon, with reports indicating that over 3,000 people have died as a result of the ongoing conflict.\n\n4. **Warnings of Regional Consequences**: UN experts have warned that the conflict risks engulfing the entire region in a humanitarian and geopolitical catastrophe. They have noted that both sides are engaging in indiscriminate attacks, which could lead to further escalation and instability.\n\nOverall, the international community's response has been characterized by calls for restraint, humanitarian assistance, and a push for diplomatic solutions to prevent further loss of life and to address the urgent needs of those affected by the conflict.
