    What were the key findings of the USCIRF report on India?
answer: >-
    The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) released its annual report for 2024, which highlighted several key findings regarding the state of religious freedom in India. Here are the main points from the report:\n\n1. **Escalating Violence Against Minorities**: The report documented a disturbing trend of increasing violence and discrimination against various religious communities in India, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Dalits, Jews, and Adivasis. It noted incidents of individuals being killed, beaten, and lynched by vigilante groups, as well as arbitrary arrests of religious leaders.\n\n2. **Legal Framework Changes**: The USCIRF report pointed out changes to India's legal framework that target and disenfranchise religious minorities. This includes the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC), and various state-level anti-conversion and cow slaughter laws, which are seen as discriminatory.\n\n3. **Designation as a Country of Particular Concern**: The report recommended that the U.S. Department of State designate India as a "Country of Particular Concern" (CPC) due to its systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. This designation is intended to prompt U.S. foreign policy actions aimed at deterring religious persecution.\n\n4. **Call for Support to Civil Society**: The USCIRF emphasized the need for increased support for civil society organizations in India that work to promote religious freedom and human rights.\n\n5. **Government Response**: In response to the report, the Indian government rejected its findings, labeling the USCIRF as a "biased organization with a political agenda." The Ministry of External Affairs criticized the report as anti-India propaganda.\n\nOverall, the USCIRF's 2024 report paints a grim picture of the state of religious freedom in India, highlighting significant concerns about the treatment of religious minorities and the legal measures that may exacerbate these issues.
