    What has been the public and media reaction to the Kerala High Court's directives on the Hema Committee report?
answer: >-
    The public and media reaction to the Kerala High Court's directives regarding the Justice Hema Committee report has been significant and multifaceted. The court's criticism of the Kerala government's "alarmingly lethargic" response to the report, which was submitted in 2019, has drawn attention to the serious allegations of sexual abuse and discrimination within the Malayalam film industry. \n\nFollowing the release of the report on August 19, 2024, which detailed shocking accounts of exploitation and harassment faced by women in the industry, there was a notable response from various stakeholders. The Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) dissolved its entire executive committee for the period 2024â€“2027, indicating a recognition of the gravity of the allegations. Additionally, the Kerala government established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the claims made in the report, further highlighting the urgency of addressing these issues.\n\nThe Kerala High Court's directive on August 22, 2024, for the government to present the full, unredacted report in a sealed cover, has been seen as a crucial step in ensuring transparency and accountability. The court's involvement of the Kerala State Women's Commission in the proceedings underscores the importance of addressing women's rights and safety in the film industry.\n\nMoreover, the court has issued warnings to media outlets against misrepresenting the information related to the report, emphasizing the need for responsible reporting to avoid misleading the public. This caution reflects the sensitivity surrounding the allegations and the potential impact of media narratives on public perception.\n\nOverall, the reaction has been one of heightened awareness and calls for action, with both the public and media closely monitoring the developments following the court's directives and the Hema Committee report.
