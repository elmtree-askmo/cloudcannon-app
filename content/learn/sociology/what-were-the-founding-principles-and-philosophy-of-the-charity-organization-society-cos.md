    What were the founding principles and philosophy of the Charity Organization Society (COS)?
answer: >-
    The Charity Organization Society (COS) was founded in London in 1869, primarily as a response to the challenges of poverty and the need for organized charitable efforts. Its founding principles and philosophy can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Coordination of Charitable Efforts**: The COS aimed to bring coherence and organization to the numerous charitable activities that were often fragmented and uncoordinated. This was intended to prevent the duplication of efforts and ensure that aid was provided effectively.\n\n2. **Scientific Approach**: The COS emphasized a scientific method in its operations, advocating for systematic assessment of the needs of the poor. This included the training of "friendly visitors," who were tasked with investigating the circumstances of those seeking assistance and providing tailored support.\n\n3. **Distinction Between the "Deserving" and "Undeserving" Poor**: A key tenet of COS philosophy was the differentiation between the "deserving" poor—those deemed to have good moral character and deserving of assistance—and the "undeserving" poor, who were often viewed with skepticism. This distinction influenced the allocation of resources and support.\n\n4. **Prevention of Pauperization**: The COS sought to prevent what it termed "pauperization in spirit," which referred to the idea that indiscriminate giving could lead to dependency and a loss of self-reliance among recipients. The organization promoted the idea that charity should empower individuals rather than create dependency.\n\n5. **Friendly Neighbourliness**: The COS philosophy included the notion that charity should be an act of friendly neighbourliness, emphasizing personal relationships and community involvement in the support of those in need.\n\n6. **Influence on Social Work**: The principles and practices established by the COS laid the groundwork for the development of social work as a profession. Its focus on family and scientific methods of intervention became foundational in the evolution of social welfare practices.\n\nOverall, the COS played a significant role in shaping the landscape of charitable work and social welfare during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, influencing both contemporary and future approaches to social assistance and community support.
