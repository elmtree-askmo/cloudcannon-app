    What is the history of the Lumenus organization?
answer: >-
    Lumenus Community Services, based in Toronto, was formed in April 2020 through the amalgamation of several organizations: Adventure Place, The Etobicoke Children's Centre, Griffin Centre, Skylark Youth, and Children and Families. This merger aimed to create a more cohesive and efficient service delivery model, allowing the organization to better serve infants, children, youth, individuals, and families by reducing barriers and expanding capacity.\n\nAs one of Ontario's largest community agencies, Lumenus provides a wide range of services, including mental health support, developmental services, autism support, and early years intervention. The organization is a not-for-profit charitable entity, which means it operates with a focus on client-centered services rather than profit generation. It is also provincially funded, having received significant public funding from the Government of Ontario.\n\nThe Lumenus Foundation was established to support the mission and vision of Lumenus by maintaining funds that can be applied to its various programs and services. The organization is dedicated to ensuring that every client has the opportunity to be seen, heard, and well, emphasizing accessibility and community support resources.\n\nOverall, Lumenus has evolved to meet the needs of its community, providing essential services to over 13,000 clients, many of whom come from underserved and marginalized backgrounds.
