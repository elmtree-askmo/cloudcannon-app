    What is the Congress Party's stance on the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes?
answer: >-
    The Congress Party has expressed its initial stance regarding the Supreme Court's recent judgment on the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) for reservation in government jobs and educational institutions. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge stated that the Congress is opposed to the implementation of the "creamy layer" concept for SCs and STs. This indicates that the party does not support the exclusion of more affluent individuals within these communities from the benefits of reservation.\n\nFurthermore, the Congress leadership is currently deliberating on the implications of the Supreme Court's decision, which allows states to create sub-categories within SCs and STs. Kharge has mentioned that the party will finalize its official position on this matter after consulting with party chief ministers, state unit leaders, and civil society groups in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling has been significant, as it acknowledges that SCs are not a homogenous group and that sub-categorisation is necessary to address the varying levels of social and educational backwardness within these communities. This decision has sparked discussions among various political factions, including concerns about potential political fragmentation among SCs if sub-categorisation is implemented.\n\nIn summary, the Congress Party is currently formulating its stance on the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes, with a clear opposition to the creamy layer concept, while also engaging in consultations to determine a comprehensive approach moving forward.
