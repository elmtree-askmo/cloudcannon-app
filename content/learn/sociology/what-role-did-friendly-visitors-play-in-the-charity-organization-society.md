    What role did 'friendly visitors' play in the Charity Organization Society?
answer: >-
    The role of 'friendly visitors' in the Charity Organization Society (COS) was pivotal in the development of early social work practices. Friendly visitors were primarily women who volunteered to provide support and assistance to individuals and families in need through home visits. This approach marked a significant shift towards a more personal and empathetic method of social welfare during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nFriendly visitors were seen as untrained proto-social workers who aimed to help the poor through moral persuasion and personal example. They would visit the homes of those receiving aid, offering advice and overseeing the family's progress. This method was rooted in the belief that unregulated and unsupervised relief could exacerbate poverty rather than alleviate it. By engaging directly with families, friendly visitors sought to understand their circumstances and promote social welfare.\n\nThe introduction of friendly visitors was a decisive innovation for the COS, which was among the first organized attempts to provide assistance to the poor in the United States. The friendly visitor model emphasized building relationships and understanding the client's context, which laid the groundwork for the casework method of social work that would evolve later.\n\nMary Richmond, a notable figure in the COS, was trained as a friendly visitor and played a significant role in increasing public awareness of the organization and its philanthropic opportunities. The influence of friendly visitors and the COS dominated charity philosophy until the 1930s, shaping the landscape of social welfare during the Progressive Era.\n\nIn summary, friendly visitors were instrumental in the early development of social work, promoting a more structured and compassionate approach to charity that focused on individual circumstances and the importance of personal relationships in social welfare.
