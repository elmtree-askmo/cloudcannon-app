    How do New World and Old World monkeys differ in their geographic distribution?
answer: >-
    New World monkeys (NWM) and Old World monkeys (OWM) differ significantly in their geographic distribution. \n\n**New World Monkeys** are primarily found in the tropical regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America. They belong to five families: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae, and are collectively classified under the superfamily Ceboidea. These monkeys are predominantly arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and include species such as marmosets, tamarins, capuchins, and spider monkeys.\n\nIn contrast, **Old World Monkeys** are distributed across sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, and northern Japan. They inhabit a wide variety of environments, ranging from tropical jungles to seasonal snow regions. The family Cercopithecidae comprises approximately 132 species of Old World monkeys, which exhibit a diverse range of habitats, diets, and social behaviors.\n\nIn summary, the key difference in geographic distribution is that New World monkeys are native to the Americas, while Old World monkeys are found in Africa and Asia. This distinction is crucial for understanding their evolutionary adaptations and ecological roles within their respective environments.
