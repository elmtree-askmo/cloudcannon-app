    How do positivism and post-positivism differ in qualitative research?
answer: >-
    Positivism and post-positivism represent two distinct philosophical approaches that significantly influence qualitative research, particularly in the social sciences.\n\n**Positivism** is grounded in the belief that knowledge is derived from observable and empirical evidence. It emphasizes the scientific method, objectivity, and the pursuit of universal laws and generalizations. Positivist researchers strive for value neutrality and verification, often relying on quantitative methods to establish causal relationships and objective truths. The focus is on creating a clear, measurable understanding of phenomena, which can lead to generalizable findings across different contexts.\n\nIn contrast, **post-positivism** acknowledges the limitations of positivism, particularly the challenges of achieving complete objectivity. It recognizes that researchers' biases and the theory-laden nature of observations can influence the research process. Post-positivism accepts that while empirical evidence remains crucial, knowledge is provisional and subject to revision. This paradigm embraces both quantitative and qualitative methods, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of complex social phenomena. Post-positivists often employ mixed methods and triangulation to capture multiple perspectives and contextual factors, thereby enhancing the richness of the data collected.\n\nIn summary, while positivism seeks objective knowledge through empirical evidence and the scientific method, post-positivism incorporates subjective perspectives and acknowledges the provisional nature of knowledge, making it more adaptable to the complexities of human experience. This shift towards post-positivist thinking reflects a broader understanding of the interplay between the researcher and the researched, ultimately enriching qualitative research methodologies.
