    How did the Immigration and Nationality Act change U.S. immigration policy?
answer: >-
    The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 significantly transformed U.S. immigration policy by abolishing the National Origins Formula, which had favored Northern and Western European immigrants since its establishment in the 1920s. This act marked a pivotal shift in the demographic landscape of the United States, as it introduced a new system that prioritized family reunification and skilled immigrants over national origin.\n\nKey changes brought about by the 1965 Act include:\n\n1. **Elimination of National Origins Quotas**: The act phased out the quota system that had been in place, which allocated visas based on the foreign-born population from each country as of 1890. This system had effectively limited immigration from non-European countries. The new legislation allowed for a more equitable distribution of visas across different nationalities.\n\n2. **Introduction of a Preference System**: The 1965 Act established a seven-category preference system that prioritized relatives of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, professionals with specialized skills, and refugees. This shift aimed to facilitate family reunification and address labor shortages in specific sectors.\n\n3. **First Limits on Western Hemisphere Immigration**: For the first time, the act imposed numerical limits on immigration from the Western Hemisphere, which had previously allowed Latin Americans to enter the U.S. with minimal restrictions. This change was significant as it altered the flow of migrant workers, particularly in agriculture.\n\n4. **Demographic Impact**: The act led to a dramatic increase in immigration from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reshaping the demographic profile of the U.S. population. By the end of the 20th century, over 18 million legal immigrants had entered the country under the new policies, significantly increasing the percentage of foreign-born individuals in the U.S. from 5% in 1965 to 14% in 2016.\n\n5. **Civil Rights Context**: The passage of the 1965 Act was influenced by the civil rights movement, reflecting a broader societal push to eliminate racial discrimination in U.S. laws. It was seen as a step towards creating a more inclusive immigration policy that aligned with the values of equality and justice.\n\nOverall, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 not only redefined the criteria for immigration to the United States but also set in motion demographic changes that continue to influence the nation today. The act's legacy is evident in the diverse makeup of the U.S. population and ongoing discussions about immigration policy and reform.
