    What impact has Sabu Varghese had on wildlife conservation efforts?
answer: >-
    Sabu Varghese, also known as Kunjumon, has made a significant impact on wildlife conservation efforts in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Thekkady, Kerala. His transformation from a smuggler to a dedicated forest protector is particularly noteworthy. Varghese was once involved in the illegal smuggling of Vayana bark, which is derived from cinnamon trees. However, he made a pivotal change in his life at the age of 23, committing himself to the conservation of the very forests he once exploited.\n\nHis efforts have been recognized through the prestigious Cricketers for Wildlife Conservation Service Award, which he received for his tireless work in forest conservation and eco-tourism. This award not only includes a cash prize of â‚¹1 lakh but also serves to honor individuals who have made remarkable contributions to wildlife protection. Varghese is a member of the Ex-Vayana Bark Collectors Eco Development Committee (EDC), where he actively participates in initiatives aimed at preserving the natural environment and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nVarghese's dedication to ending illegal activities in the Periyar forest reflects his commitment to wildlife conservation. His inspiring journey from a poacher to a protector serves as a powerful example of how individuals can change their paths and contribute positively to environmental efforts. Through his work, he has become a role model for others in the community, demonstrating that it is possible to reconcile human needs with the preservation of wildlife and natural habitats.
