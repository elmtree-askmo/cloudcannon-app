    How do prevention and preservation efforts contribute to child welfare?
answer: >-
    Prevention and preservation efforts play a crucial role in enhancing child welfare by addressing the root causes of child maltreatment and family separation. These efforts are increasingly recognized in federal policy, particularly through the Families First Prevention Services Act of 2018 (FFPSA), which emphasizes the importance of providing preventive services to families at risk of removal. The act aims to expand eligibility for funding to cover these services, thereby enabling families to remain together and thrive.\n\nChild welfare agencies that focus on prevention collaborate with communities and other systems to deliver services designed to prevent maltreatment and strengthen families. This approach is structured along a three-level continuum of prevention, which includes:\n\n1. **Universal Prevention**: Initiatives aimed at the general population to promote well-being and prevent maltreatment.\n2. **Selective Prevention**: Targeted services for families identified as at risk of experiencing difficulties.\n3. **Indicated Prevention**: Interventions for families where maltreatment has already occurred but where further harm can be prevented.\n\nResearch indicates that investing in prevention not only reduces the incidence of child maltreatment but also addresses systemic inequities within the child welfare system. Effective strategies include public awareness campaigns, parent education, home visitation programs, and community-based prevention efforts. These initiatives have shown promise in reducing the likelihood of child abuse and neglect.\n\nMoreover, simulation models suggest that when preventive services and kinship care are prioritized together, multiple policy objectives can be achieved. These include a reduction in maltreatment rates, improved experiences for children within the system, better outcomes in young adulthood, and decreased overall costs associated with child welfare services.\n\nIn summary, prevention and preservation efforts are essential for fostering child welfare, as they help families stay together, reduce the need for foster care, and ultimately promote the well-being of children and families in the community.
