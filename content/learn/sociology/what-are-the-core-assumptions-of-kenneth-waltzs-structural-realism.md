    What are the core assumptions of Kenneth Waltz's structural realism?
answer: >-
    Kenneth Waltz's structural realism, also known as neorealism, is a significant theory in international relations that emphasizes the structure of the international system as the primary determinant of state behavior. Here are the core assumptions of Waltz's structural realism:\n\n1. **Anarchy of the International System**: Waltz posits that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority or government to enforce rules or provide security. This condition leads states to operate in a self-help environment where they must ensure their own survival.\n\n2. **State Behavior Driven by Structure**: Unlike classical realism, which often attributes state behavior to human nature or individual leaders, structural realism focuses on the systemic level. Waltz argues that the structure of the international system, particularly the distribution of power among states, is the key factor influencing state actions.\n\n3. **Power as the Central Element**: Power is viewed as the most critical factor in international relations. States are primarily concerned with their relative power positions, which influences their interactions and strategies. Waltz distinguishes between states aiming merely to survive and those seeking to maximize their power, with his own view aligning more with the former.\n\n4. **Competition and Conflict**: Structural realism acknowledges that competition and conflict are enduring features of international relations. The anarchic nature of the system leads to uncertainty regarding other states' intentions, prompting states to engage in power politics to secure their interests.\n\n5. **Systemic Explanation of War**: Waltz argues that wars and conflicts can be explained through the lens of the international system's structure rather than individual state actions or decisions. He emphasizes that the characteristics of the system itself, such as the distribution of power, play a crucial role in understanding the causes of war.\n\n6. **Limited Potential for Cooperation**: While cooperation is possible, structural realism suggests that it is limited due to the inherent distrust among states in an anarchic system. States are often wary of each other's intentions, which constrains their willingness to cooperate.\n\nWaltz's work, particularly in his 1979 book "Theory of International Politics," has been foundational in shaping the field of international relations and has led to extensive debates and further developments in realist theory.
