    What is the difference between episodic and thematic framing in media coverage?
answer: >-
    Episodic and thematic framing are two distinct approaches used in media coverage that significantly influence how audiences perceive issues.\n\n1. **Episodic Framing**: This approach focuses on specific events or individual cases. It presents issues through personal stories or isolated incidents, often neglecting the broader context. For example, in reporting on poverty, an episodic frame might highlight the struggles of a single family facing financial hardship. This type of framing personalizes the issue, making it relatable but potentially leading to a limited understanding of the systemic factors at play. Research by Iyengar (1991) indicates that episodic framing can result in viewers being less likely to hold public officials accountable for broader societal problems, as they may attribute responsibility to individual circumstances rather than systemic issues.\n\n2. **Thematic Framing**: In contrast, thematic framing places issues within a broader context, highlighting underlying trends, causes, and social or political factors. Using the same example of poverty, a thematic frame would discuss the economic conditions contributing to poverty rates, linking it to larger societal issues such as unemployment or policy failures. This approach encourages audiences to consider collective responsibility and the need for systemic solutions. Iyengar's research also shows that thematic framing can lead to greater perceived government responsibility for addressing social issues, as it emphasizes the interconnectedness of societal problems.\n\nIn summary, episodic framing tends to focus on individual stories and events, which can lead to a narrow understanding of issues, while thematic framing provides a wider perspective that encourages consideration of broader social contexts and responsibilities. This distinction is crucial in understanding how media coverage can shape public opinion and influence perceptions of accountability regarding social issues.
