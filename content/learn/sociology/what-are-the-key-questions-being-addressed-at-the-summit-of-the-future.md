    What are the key questions being addressed at the Summit of the Future?
answer: >-
    The Summit of the Future, scheduled for September 2024, aims to address several critical global issues through the adoption of a comprehensive Pact for the Future. Here are the key questions and themes being discussed at the summit:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development and Financing**: How can countries work together to ensure sustainable development while securing the necessary financing to achieve these goals?\n\n2. **International Peace and Security**: In light of increasing conflict and violence, what measures can be taken to enhance global peace and security? This includes discussions on reforming the Security Council and ensuring compliance with international law, particularly the decisions of the International Court of Justice.\n\n3. **Science, Technology, Innovation, and Digital Cooperation**: What role do science and technology play in addressing global challenges, and how can international cooperation in these areas be strengthened?\n\n4. **Youth and Future Generations**: How can the voices of youth be integrated into global governance, and what commitments can be made to ensure that future generations are considered in decision-making processes?\n\n5. **Transforming Global Governance**: What reforms are necessary in international institutions to create a more equitable and effective global governance structure that reflects the realities of the 21st century?\n\nThe summit is also expected to focus on the urgent need for action against climate change and the promotion of human rights, as well as the establishment of a "New Agenda for Peace" to address the current global security landscape. The inclusion of youth leaders in these discussions marks a significant step towards a more inclusive and future-oriented governance model. \n\nOverall, the Summit of the Future represents a pivotal moment for world leaders to unite in tackling pressing global challenges and to renew trust and solidarity among nations.
