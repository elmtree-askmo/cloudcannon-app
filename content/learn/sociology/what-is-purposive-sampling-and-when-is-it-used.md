    What is purposive sampling and when is it used?
answer: >-
    Purposive sampling, also known as judgmental or selective sampling, is a non-probability sampling technique widely used in qualitative research. This method involves the deliberate selection of participants based on specific characteristics or criteria that align with the objectives of the study. Researchers choose individuals, cases, or events that they believe will provide the most relevant and insightful information regarding the research topic.\n\nPurposive sampling is particularly useful in situations where the researcher aims to focus on a specific subset of the population that shares certain traits or experiences. It allows for in-depth exploration of particular phenomena, making it ideal for studies that require detailed insights from knowledgeable or experienced individuals. For example, if a researcher is studying the mental health outcomes among families of COVID-19 victims, they might use purposive sampling to select participants who have directly experienced this situation.\n\nThis sampling technique is best employed when the research aims to gather rich, qualitative data rather than to generalize findings to a larger population. It is especially beneficial when resources are limited, and the researcher seeks to maximize the depth of information obtained from a smaller sample size. However, researchers should be aware of potential biases, such as observer bias, that can arise from the subjective nature of participant selection in purposive sampling.\n\nIn summary, purposive sampling is a strategic approach to participant selection that enhances the relevance and depth of qualitative research findings, making it a valuable tool for researchers aiming to understand complex social phenomena.
