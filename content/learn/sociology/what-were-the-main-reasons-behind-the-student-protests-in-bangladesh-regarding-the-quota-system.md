    What were the main reasons behind the student protests in Bangladesh regarding the quota system?
answer: >-
    The student protests in Bangladesh regarding the quota system were primarily driven by several key factors:\n\n1. **Discrimination Against Merit**: Students argued that the quota system, which was reinstated to benefit the descendants of freedom fighters from the 1971 liberation war, was discriminatory and hindered merit-based appointments in government jobs. Many students felt that their opportunities were being limited based on factors unrelated to their qualifications or abilities.\n\n2. **Reinstatement of Quota**: The protests gained momentum in June 2024 after the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstated a 30% quota for these descendants, reversing a previous government decision made in response to the 2018 quota reform movement. This reinstatement was perceived as a setback for meritocracy and fueled discontent among students who believed that the system was outdated and unfair.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The quota system was first implemented in 1972, and over the years, it has faced criticism and calls for reform. The protests were partly a reaction to the long-standing grievances regarding the quota system, which many students viewed as a relic of the past that no longer served its intended purpose.\n\n4. **Violence and Political Tensions**: The protests turned violent as clashes erupted between student demonstrators, police, and pro-government supporters. This violence highlighted the broader political tensions in the country and the students' determination to challenge a system they viewed as unjust.\n\n5. **Public Support and Reform Committees**: The protests were supported by various public service reform committees and even the Public Service Commission, which had expressed objections to the quota policy. This backing indicated a wider consensus on the need for reform beyond just the student body.\n\nOverall, the protests reflected a significant push for change in the recruitment process for government jobs in Bangladesh, emphasizing the need for a system that prioritizes merit over historical affiliations.
