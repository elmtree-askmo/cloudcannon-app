    What are the steps for command line installation of C programming tools?
answer: >-
    To install C programming tools via the command line, the steps can vary depending on your operating system. Below are the instructions for both macOS and Windows:\n\n### For macOS:\n1. **Open Terminal**: You can find it using Spotlight or in the Applications > Utilities folder.\n2. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**: Type the following command in the Terminal:\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n   This will prompt you to install the necessary tools, including the Clang compiler.\n\n### For Windows:\n1. **Download MinGW**: Go to the MinGW website and download the installer.\n2. **Run the Installer**: During installation, select the `mingw-w64` package to install the GCC compiler.\n3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   - Search for 'Environment Variables' in the Start menu.\n   - Click on 'Edit the system environment variables'.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on 'Environment Variables'.\n   - Under 'System variables', find the `Path` variable and click 'Edit'.\n   - Add the path to the MinGW `bin` folder, typically `C:\MinGW\bin`.\n4. **Verify Installation**: Open Command Prompt and type:\n   ```bash\n   gcc --version\n   ```\n   This command checks if GCC is accessible from the command prompt.\n\n### Compiling and Running a C Program:\n1. **Create a C Source File**: Use a text editor to write your C code and save it with a `.c` extension.\n2. **Open Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory where your C file is located using the `cd` command.\n3. **Compile the Program**: Use the following command to compile your C program:\n   ```bash\n   gcc sourcefile_name.c -o outputfile.exe\n   ```\n4. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program by typing:\n   ```bash\n   outputfile.exe\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up a command line environment for C programming on both macOS and Windows.
