    What tools or libraries are available for testing Scheme programs?
answer: >-
    For testing Scheme programs, there are several tools and libraries available that can facilitate unit testing and other testing methodologies. Here are some notable options:\n\n1. **SRFI 64**: This is a Scheme Request for Implementation that provides a standardized API for test suites. It allows developers to create and manage test cases in a consistent manner across different Scheme implementations.\n\n2. **Chicken Test Egg**: This is a testing framework specifically designed for the Chicken Scheme implementation. It provides tools for writing and running unit tests, making it easier to ensure code correctness.\n\n3. **Chibi Test Library**: This library is part of the Chibi Scheme implementation and offers a lightweight testing framework. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.\n\n4. **SRFI 78**: This SRFI introduces lightweight testing based on eager comprehensions. It provides a minimalistic approach to testing, which can be beneficial for quick and straightforward test cases.\n\n5. **Custom Testing Frameworks**: Many developers create their own simple testing frameworks tailored to their specific needs. For example, a custom framework can be implemented to provide immediate feedback during the Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle.\n\n6. **Unit Testing Frameworks**: Various Scheme implementations come with their own built-in unit testing frameworks. These frameworks typically offer features such as assertions, test case organization, and reporting.\n\nThese tools and libraries enhance the testing capabilities in Scheme, allowing developers to write robust and maintainable code. Each option has its own strengths, so the choice of which to use may depend on the specific Scheme implementation and the requirements of the project.
