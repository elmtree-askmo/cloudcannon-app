answer: >-
    To calculate the square root of a number using the math module in Python, you can utilize the `math.sqrt()` function. This function takes a single argument, which is the number for which you want to find the square root, and it returns the square root of that number.\n\nHere’s how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you need to import the math module.\n2. Then, you can call the `math.sqrt()` function with the desired number.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 16\nresult = math.sqrt(16)\nprint(result)  # Output: 4.0\n```\n\nIn this example, the square root of 16 is calculated, and the output is 4.0. You can replace `16` with any non-negative number to find its square root. Note that if you pass a negative number to `math.sqrt()`, it will raise a `ValueError` since the square root of a negative number is not defined in the realm of real numbers. \n\nFor example, if you try:\n\n```python\nresult = math.sqrt(-4)  # This will raise a ValueError\n```\n\nTo handle such cases gracefully, you can use a try-except block:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ntry:\n    result = math.sqrt(-4)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print("Error:", e)  # Output: Error: math domain error\n```\n\nThis way, you can manage exceptions and ensure your program runs smoothly even when encountering errors.
