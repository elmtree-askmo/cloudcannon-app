    What is the syntax for defining a function in Python?
answer: >-
    In Python, the syntax for defining a function involves using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses that may include parameters, and a colon. The body of the function, which contains the code to be executed, is indented below the definition. Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:\n\n1. **Define the function**: Start with the `def` keyword.\n2. **Function name**: Choose a descriptive name for the function.\n3. **Parameters**: Include any parameters the function should accept within parentheses. If there are no parameters, just use empty parentheses.\n4. **Colon**: End the function definition line with a colon.\n5. **Function body**: Indent the next lines to define the body of the function.\n\nHere’s an example of a simple function definition:\n\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    """Return the sum of a and b."""\n    return a + b\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `add` is the name of the function.\n- It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n- The function body contains a return statement that computes the sum of `a` and `b`.\n- The docstring provides a brief description of what the function does.\n\nFunctions can be called multiple times with different arguments, which promotes code reuse and makes programs easier to maintain and modify.
