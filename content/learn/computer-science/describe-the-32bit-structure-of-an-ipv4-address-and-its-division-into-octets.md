    An IPv4 address is a 32-bit identifier for devices on a network, divided into four octets of 8 bits each, represented in dotted decimal format. The structure supports network and host identification, modulated by a subnet mask.

    Describe the 32-bit structure of an IPv4 address and its division into octets.
answer: >-
    An IPv4 address is a unique identifier for a device on a network, consisting of a total of 32 bits. This 32-bit structure is divided into four octets, with each octet containing 8 bits. The octets are typically represented in a dotted decimal format, which makes it easier for humans to read and understand. For example, the IPv4 address 192.168.10.1 can be broken down into its binary representation as follows:\n\n- 192: 11000000\n- 168: 10101000\n- 10: 00001010\n- 1: 00000001\n\nThus, the complete binary representation of the IPv4 address 192.168.10.1 is:\n\n$$\n11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001\n$$\n\n### Division of the IPv4 Address\n\n1. **Octets**: Each of the four octets can range from 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This range is derived from the fact that each octet is an 8-bit binary number, allowing for $2^8 = 256$ possible values (0 to 255).\n\n2. **Network Portion and Host Portion**: The structure of an IPv4 address is hierarchical. The first part of the address identifies the network to which the device belongs, while the latter part identifies the specific device (host) within that network. The division between the network and host portions is determined by the subnet mask.\n\n3. **Subnet Mask**: A subnet mask is a 32-bit pattern that indicates which bits of the IPv4 address are used for the network portion and which bits are used for the host portion. For example, in the address 192.168.1.1 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the first 24 bits (192.168.1) represent the network, and the last 8 bits (1) represent the host.\n\nIn summary, the 32-bit structure of an IPv4 address is crucial for identifying devices on a network and is organized into four octets, facilitating both human readability and efficient routing of data across networks.
