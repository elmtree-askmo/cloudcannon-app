    What are the key components of the Astraea framework?
answer: >-
    The Astraea framework is designed to address the challenges of imbalanced data in federated learning (FL) environments, particularly in mobile deep learning applications. Here are the key components of the Astraea framework:\n\n1. **FL Server**: The central component responsible for coordinating the federated learning process. It aggregates model updates from clients and manages the overall training process.\n\n2. **Mediator**: This component plays a crucial role in managing the interactions between clients. It facilitates multi-client rescheduling based on their data distributions, ensuring that the training process is balanced and fair across different clients.\n\n3. **Clients**: These are the individual devices (such as mobile phones and IoT devices) that participate in the federated learning process. Each client trains a local model on its own data and sends updates to the FL server.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation Strategies**: Astraea employs global data distribution-based data augmentation techniques to alleviate the imbalances in the data available to different clients. This helps improve the overall classification accuracy of the model.\n\n5. **Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning**: At the heart of Astraea is a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that optimizes convergence properties during the training process. This framework enables the learning of interactive policies between multiple competing flows, enhancing stability and performance.\n\n6. **Experimental Evaluation**: Astraea has been implemented and evaluated using the TensorFlow Federated Framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets, such as imbalanced EMNIST.\n\nThese components work together to create a self-balancing federated learning environment that addresses the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions, ultimately leading to improved model performance in mobile deep learning applications.
