    What are the key performance metrics used to evaluate mainframe computers?
answer: >-
    Key performance metrics used to evaluate mainframe computers include several critical indicators that help assess the overall health and efficiency of the system. Here are some of the primary metrics:\n\n1. **Resource Utilization**: This metric measures the amount of time that resources (such as CPU, I/O, storage, and network) are actively busy processing workloads. High resource utilization indicates efficient use of the mainframe's capabilities, while low utilization may suggest underutilization or inefficiencies.\n\n2. **Transaction Throughput**: This refers to the number of transactions processed by the mainframe within a specific time frame. It is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance of transactional workloads, which are often mission-critical for businesses.\n\n3. **Response Time**: This metric measures the time taken to process a request and return a response. Lower response times are indicative of better performance, especially in environments where user experience is critical.\n\n4. **Job Completion Time**: This measures the time taken to complete specific jobs or workloads. Monitoring this metric helps identify bottlenecks and optimize job scheduling.\n\n5. **Capacity Management**: Keeping an eye on capacity ensures that there is sufficient spare capacity to handle peak loads. This involves assessing the resources needed at the time of purchase and ensuring that the system can scale as required.\n\n6. **Error Rates**: Monitoring the frequency of errors or failures in processing can help identify issues that may affect performance. High error rates may indicate problems with the hardware, software, or workload management.\n\n7. **Performance Tuning Metrics**: These metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of performance tuning efforts. They help in understanding whether adjustments made to the system have resulted in improved performance.\n\n8. **Overall System Health**: This encompasses a combination of the above metrics to provide a holistic view of the mainframe's performance. Regular system reports can help in assessing the overall health and identifying areas for improvement.\n\nBy continuously monitoring these performance metrics, organizations can optimize their mainframe operations, ensure efficient resource utilization, and maintain high levels of service availability.
