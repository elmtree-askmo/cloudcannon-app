    List three advantages of using networks over standalone machines.
answer: >-
    Using networks instead of standalone machines offers several advantages. Here are three key benefits:\n\n1. **Resource Sharing**: Networks allow multiple users to share resources such as files, printers, and internet connections. This capability enhances efficiency and reduces costs, as users can access shared devices and data without needing individual setups for each machine.\n\n2. **Improved Communication**: Networks facilitate better communication among users through various means such as email, instant messaging, and collaborative tools. This interconnectedness enables real-time communication and collaboration, which is particularly beneficial in team environments and for remote work.\n\n3. **Centralized Management**: With a network, resources and data can be managed centrally. This centralization simplifies tasks such as software updates, security management, and data backups. Administrators can easily monitor and control access to resources, enhancing security and ensuring that all devices are up-to-date.\n\nThese advantages highlight the effectiveness of networks in enhancing productivity and collaboration compared to standalone machines.
