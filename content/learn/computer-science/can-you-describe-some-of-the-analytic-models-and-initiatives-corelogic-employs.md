    Can you describe some of the analytic models and initiatives CoreLogic employs?
answer: >-
    CoreLogic employs a variety of analytic models and initiatives that leverage advanced data management and analytics to address challenges in the property ecosystem. Here are some key initiatives and models:\n\n1. **Climate Risk Analytics™**: This initiative is designed to help government agencies and enterprises measure, model, and mitigate the physical risks of climate change to the real estate industry. CoreLogic's climate risk models allow companies to financially assess and manage the impact of climate change on properties, projecting risks up to the year 2050.\n\n2. **Smart Data Platform**: Powered by AI modeling and a robust data ingestion framework, this platform has delivered over one million additional usable Automated Valuation Models (AVMs). It aims to enhance efficiencies in the digital home loan ecosystem by providing more accurate property valuations.\n\n3. **Discovery Platform™**: This platform integrates CoreLogic’s proprietary CLIP® ID, which is the industry’s first integrated property identifier. It offers no-code data analytics tools for real estate professionals, enabling them to derive insights from over 50 years of data covering 99.9% of U.S. properties. This initiative focuses on providing granular property-level information to improve business insights.\n\n4. **Image Analytics**: CoreLogic is utilizing image analytics to assist appraisers in capturing real-time appraisals, which enhances quality assurance processes. This technology allows for more accurate assessments and quicker turnaround times in property evaluations.\n\n5. **Strata Sum Sure**: This tool generates rebuild cost estimates for multi-storey strata-titled properties based on current construction costs, helping clients manage financial risks associated with property damage and insurance.\n\n6. **Climate API**: CoreLogic offers an on-demand Climate API that automates risk management workflows, allowing businesses to integrate climate-related financial risks into their operational frameworks effectively.\n\nThese initiatives reflect CoreLogic's commitment to leveraging data-driven insights and technological innovations to enhance risk management, improve real estate transactions, and support the broader property ecosystem.
