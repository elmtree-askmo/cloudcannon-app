    How does time complexity differ from space complexity in measuring algorithm efficiency?
answer: >-
    Time complexity and space complexity are two fundamental aspects of algorithm efficiency, each measuring different resources consumed by an algorithm during its execution.\n\n### Time Complexity\nTime complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is typically expressed using Big-O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the running time relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n)$ indicates that the time taken grows linearly with the input size, while an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ suggests that the time taken grows quadratically.\n\n### Space Complexity\nSpace complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute, including both the space needed for the input data and any additional space required for variables, data structures, and function calls. Like time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using Big-O notation. For instance, an algorithm that requires additional space proportional to the input size might have a space complexity of $O(n)$.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Resource Measured**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Measures the execution time of an algorithm.\n   - **Space Complexity**: Measures the memory usage of an algorithm.\n\n2. **Impact on Performance**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Affects how quickly an algorithm can process data, which is crucial for performance, especially in time-sensitive applications.\n   - **Space Complexity**: Affects how much memory is consumed, which is critical in environments with limited memory resources.\n\n3. **Optimization Focus**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Optimizing for time complexity often involves reducing the number of operations or improving the algorithm's efficiency.\n   - **Space Complexity**: Optimizing for space complexity may involve using more efficient data structures or algorithms that require less memory.\n\n4. **In-Place Algorithms**: Some algorithms are designed to operate in-place, meaning they require a minimal amount of extra space (often $O(1)$), which can be beneficial in memory-constrained environments.\n\nIn summary, both time complexity and space complexity are essential for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, and they often need to be balanced against each other depending on the specific requirements of the application. Understanding these complexities helps in selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem.
