    How does a Wide Area Network (WAN) differ from a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
answer: >-
    A Wide Area Network (WAN) and a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) differ primarily in their geographical coverage and the scale of their operations.\n\n1. **Geographical Coverage**:\n   - **MAN**: A Metropolitan Area Network spans a metropolitan area or a city, typically covering a range of up to 50 kilometers. It is designed to connect multiple locations within this confined area, such as different buildings or campuses within a city.\n   - **WAN**: In contrast, a Wide Area Network covers a much larger geographical area, potentially spanning multiple cities, countries, or even continents. WANs are often used to connect various Local Area Networks (LANs) across vast distances.\n\n2. **Purpose and Use Cases**:\n   - **MAN**: MANs are often utilized by businesses and organizations to facilitate communication and resource sharing within a city. They can interconnect multiple LANs in a metropolitan area, providing efficient access to shared resources and internet connectivity.\n   - **WAN**: WANs are used for broader connectivity needs, such as linking branch offices of a corporation across different regions or countries. They enable communication and data exchange over long distances, making them essential for global businesses.\n\n3. **Speed and Performance**:\n   - **MAN**: The speed of a MAN can range from 44 to 155 Mbps, which is generally higher than that of a WAN due to the shorter distances involved.\n   - **WAN**: The speed of WANs can vary significantly based on the technology used (e.g., satellite, fiber optics) and the distance covered, but they are typically slower than MANs due to the greater distances and potential for more latency.\n\n4. **Infrastructure**:\n   - **MAN**: MANs often utilize technologies such as fiber optics and high-speed wireless connections to maintain high data transfer rates within the metropolitan area.\n   - **WAN**: WANs may employ a variety of transmission technologies, including leased lines, satellite links, and microwave transmissions, to connect disparate networks over long distances.\n\nIn summary, while both MANs and WANs serve to connect networks, they differ significantly in their geographical scope, purpose, speed, and the technologies used to implement them.
