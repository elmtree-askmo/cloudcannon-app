    What distinguishes rational numbers from irrational numbers?
answer: >-
    Rational numbers and irrational numbers are two distinct categories of real numbers, and they can be differentiated based on their definitions and properties.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Rational Numbers**: A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form of a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. This means that rational numbers can be represented as ratios of two integers. Examples include $ \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{4}, 0.3 $ (which can be written as $ \frac{3}{10} $), and $6$ (which can be expressed as $ \frac{6}{1} $).\n   \n   - **Irrational Numbers**: An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. This means that it cannot be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ for any integers $p$ and $q$. The decimal representation of irrational numbers is non-terminating and non-repeating. Examples include $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, and $e$.\n\n2. **Decimal Representation**:\n   - Rational numbers can either terminate (like $0.5$) or repeat (like $0.333...$). \n   - Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that neither terminate nor repeat. For instance, the decimal expansion of $\pi$ is approximately $3.14159...$ and continues infinitely without repeating.\n\n3. **Properties**:\n   - The sum or product of two rational numbers is always a rational number. For example, adding $ \frac{1}{2} $ and $ \frac{1}{3} $ results in $ \frac{5}{6} $, which is rational.\n   - However, the sum or product of two irrational numbers may not necessarily be irrational. For example, \(\sqrt{2} + (-\sqrt{2}) = 0\), which is rational.\n\n4. **Number Line**:\n   - On the number line, rational numbers are dense, meaning between any two rational numbers, there exists another rational number. Irrational numbers fill in the gaps between rational numbers, ensuring that every point on the number line corresponds to a real number.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between rational and irrational numbers lies in their ability to be expressed as fractions of integers, with rational numbers fitting this criterion and irrational numbers not being able to do so.
