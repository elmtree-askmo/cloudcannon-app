answer: >-
    Layered architecture supports modularity in system design by organizing a system into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and interactions. This structure enhances modularity in several key ways:\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, allowing developers to focus on one layer at a time without needing to understand the entire system. This separation makes it easier to manage complexity and promotes clearer organization of code.\n\n2. **Isolation of Changes**: Changes made in one layer do not directly affect other layers. This means that developers can modify or update a layer independently, which minimizes the risk of introducing bugs in other parts of the system. For example, if a change is needed in the data access layer, it can be implemented without altering the presentation layer.\n\n3. **Independent Development and Testing**: Each layer can be developed and tested independently, which facilitates parallel development efforts. Teams can work on different layers simultaneously, improving development efficiency and reducing time to market.\n\n4. **Reusability**: Layers can be designed as reusable components. For instance, a data access layer can be reused across different applications, which reduces redundancy and promotes consistency in how data is handled.\n\n5. **Scalability**: The modular nature of layered architecture allows systems to be scaled more easily. New layers can be added to accommodate additional functionality without disrupting existing layers, making it easier to adapt to changing business requirements.\n\n6. **Enhanced Maintenance**: With a clear structure and defined responsibilities, maintaining a layered system becomes more straightforward. Developers can quickly identify which layer to modify when issues arise, leading to faster resolution times.\n\nIn summary, layered architecture fosters modularity by promoting a clear separation of concerns, allowing for isolated changes, enabling independent development and testing, supporting reusability, enhancing scalability, and simplifying maintenance. This modular approach is particularly beneficial in complex systems, where managing interactions and dependencies can otherwise become challenging.
