    What symbol is used in flowcharts to represent the start or end of a process?
answer: >-
    In flowcharts, the symbol used to represent the start or end of a process is the **oval** shape, also known as the terminal symbol. This symbol indicates where the process begins and where it concludes, making it essential for clearly defining the boundaries of the flowchart.\n\nTo summarize the key components of flowcharts:\n\n1. **Terminal Symbol (Oval)**: Represents the start and end points of the flowchart.\n2. **Process Symbol (Rectangle)**: Indicates processes or operations being performed.\n3. **Decision Symbol (Diamond)**: Represents decision points with multiple outcomes (e.g., yes/no).\n4. **Input/Output Symbol (Parallelogram)**: Shows where data is inputted or outputted.\n5. **Subroutine Symbol**: Represents a call to a subroutine, which has its own flowchart.\n6. **Flow Lines (Lines with Arrows)**: Indicate the flow of control and data between steps.\n\nThese symbols help in visualizing the sequence of steps in an algorithm, facilitating both design and communication of processes effectively.
