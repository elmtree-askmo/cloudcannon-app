    How does the insertion process work in a min heap?

    The insertion process in a min heap is a systematic procedure that ensures the heap property is maintained after adding a new element. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the insertion works:\n\n### Steps for Insertion in a Min Heap\n\n1. **Insert at the Bottom**: The first step in the insertion process is to add the new element at the bottom of the heap. In terms of array representation, this means appending the new element to the end of the array that represents the heap.\n\n2. **Increment the Size**: After inserting the new element, the size of the heap is incremented to reflect the addition.\n\n3. **Sift Up (Bubble Up)**: Once the new element is added, it may violate the min heap property, which states that each parent node must be less than or equal to its child nodes. To restore this property, a process called "sifting up" (or "bubbling up") is performed:\n   - Compare the newly added element with its parent node.\n   - If the new element is smaller than its parent, swap them.\n   - Continue this process until the new element is either larger than its parent or it reaches the root of the heap.\n\n### Example of Insertion\n\nConsider inserting the elements 10, 12, 14, 1, and 6 into an initially empty min heap:\n\n- **Insert 10**: Heap becomes `[10]`\n- **Insert 12**: Heap becomes `[10, 12]`\n- **Insert 14**: Heap becomes `[10, 12, 14]`\n- **Insert 1**: Heap becomes `[10, 12, 14, 1]` (inserted at the bottom)\n  - Sift up: 1 < 10, so swap → Heap becomes `[1, 12, 14, 10]`\n- **Insert 6**: Heap becomes `[1, 12, 14, 10, 6]` (inserted at the bottom)\n  - Sift up: 6 < 12, so swap → Heap becomes `[1, 6, 14, 10, 12]`\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the insertion operation in a min heap is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the heap. This is due to the height of the heap being logarithmic in relation to the number of elements, and the sifting process may need to traverse this height.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe insertion process in a min heap is efficient and straightforward, involving the addition of the new element at the end of the heap and then adjusting its position to maintain the heap order property through the sifting up process. This ensures that the smallest element remains at the root, which is a fundamental characteristic of min heaps.
