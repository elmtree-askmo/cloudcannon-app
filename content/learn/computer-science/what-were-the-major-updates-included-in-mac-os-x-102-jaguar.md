    What were the major updates included in Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar?
answer: >-
    Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed "Jaguar," was released on August 23, 2002, and it introduced several significant updates and features that enhanced the user experience and performance of the operating system. Here are the major updates included in Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar:\n\n1. **Performance Improvements**: Jaguar brought substantial raw performance enhancements, making the operating system faster and more efficient.\n\n2. **User Interface Enhancements**: The update included over 150 user-interface enhancements, contributing to a sleeker and more modern look.\n\n3. **Quartz Extreme**: This feature allowed for hardware-accelerated graphics rendering, enabling compositing graphics directly on supported video cards (such as the ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX) with at least 16 MB of VRAM. This significantly improved the visual performance of applications.\n\n4. **Address Book**: A new system-wide repository for contact information was introduced with the Address Book application, allowing users to manage their contacts more effectively.\n\n5. **iChat**: Jaguar included an instant messaging client named iChat, which allowed users to communicate with others over the internet seamlessly.\n\n6. **Startup Screen Change**: The traditional "Happy Mac" icon that had been part of the Mac OS startup sequence for nearly 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo, marking a visual shift in the startup experience.\n\nThese updates collectively made Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar a significant release in the evolution of Apple's operating system, setting the stage for future developments in the Mac OS X line.
