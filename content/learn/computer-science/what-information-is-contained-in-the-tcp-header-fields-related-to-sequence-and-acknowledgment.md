    What information is contained in the TCP header fields related to sequence and acknowledgment?
answer: >-
    The TCP header contains several critical fields related to sequence and acknowledgment, which are essential for ensuring reliable data transmission. Here are the key fields:\n\n1. **Sequence Number**: This field is used to keep track of the order of the segments being sent. Each byte of data is assigned a unique sequence number, which allows the receiving end to reassemble the data in the correct order, even if segments arrive out of sequence. The sequence number indicates the first byte of data in the segment.\n\n2. **Acknowledgment Number**: This field indicates the next expected byte that the receiver is expecting to receive. It serves as a confirmation that all bytes up to (but not including) this number have been successfully received. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment for a segment, it will retransmit that segment.\n\nThese two fields work together to provide reliable delivery and ordered data transmission, which are fundamental features of the TCP protocol. The acknowledgment mechanism ensures that lost or corrupted segments are retransmitted, while the sequence number allows for proper data reassembly at the destination. \n\nIn summary, the sequence and acknowledgment fields in the TCP header are crucial for maintaining the integrity and order of data during transmission, enabling TCP to function as a reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
