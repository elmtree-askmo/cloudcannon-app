    What are the different types of interrupts in computing?
answer: >-
    In computing, interrupts are signals that indicate to the processor that an event needs immediate attention. They can be classified into two main categories: **hardware interrupts** and **software interrupts**. Each of these categories can be further divided into subtypes.\n\n### 1. Hardware Interrupts\nHardware interrupts are generated by external devices or hardware components. They signal the processor to stop its current activities and address the needs of the hardware. Examples include:\n\n- **I/O Device Interrupts**: These occur when an input/output device, such as a keyboard or mouse, requires processing. For instance, pressing a key on the keyboard generates a hardware interrupt to notify the CPU that input is available.\n- **Timer Interrupts**: Generated by the system timer, these interrupts allow the operating system to perform regular tasks, such as updating system time or managing multitasking.\n\n### 2. Software Interrupts\nSoftware interrupts are generated by programs or the operating system itself. They can be further classified into:\n\n- **Normal Interrupts**: These are triggered by specific software instructions, often used for system calls or to request services from the operating system.\n- **Exceptions**: These are unplanned interruptions that occur during program execution, such as division by zero or accessing invalid memory. Exceptions require immediate attention to handle errors or unusual conditions.\n\n### Additional Classifications\nInterrupts can also be categorized based on their handling characteristics:\n\n- **Maskable Interrupts**: These interrupts can be ignored or disabled by the processor. The CPU can choose to mask these interrupts based on the current execution context.\n- **Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI)**: These interrupts cannot be ignored and are typically used for critical events, such as hardware failures or emergency situations that require immediate attention.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, interrupts play a crucial role in managing the flow of information between the CPU and external devices, allowing for efficient multitasking and responsiveness in computing systems. Understanding the different types of interrupts and their functions is essential for grasping how modern computer architectures operate.
