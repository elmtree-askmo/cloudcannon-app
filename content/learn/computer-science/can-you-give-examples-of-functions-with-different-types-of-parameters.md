    In C++, functions can accept parameters in various ways, and understanding these different types of parameters is crucial for effective programming. Here are examples of functions with different types of parameters:\n\n1. **Pass by Value**: In this method, a copy of the actual parameter is passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.\n\n   ```cpp\n   int add(int x, int y) {\n       return x + y; // x and y are passed by value\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       int a = 5, b = 10;\n       int sum = add(a, b); // a and b remain unchanged\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Pass by Reference**: This method passes the actual parameter by reference, allowing the function to modify the original argument.\n\n   ```cpp\n   void swap(int &x, int &y) {\n       int temp = x;\n       x = y;\n       y = temp; // x and y are passed by reference\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       int a = 5, b = 10;\n       swap(a, b); // a and b are swapped\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Pass by Pointer**: In this method, the address of the actual parameter is passed to the function, allowing for modification of the original argument.\n\n   ```cpp\n   void increment(int *p) {\n       (*p)++; // p points to the original variable\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       int a = 5;\n       increment(&a); // a is incremented\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Default Parameters**: C++ allows functions to have default values for parameters, which are used if no argument is provided.\n\n   ```cpp\n   void greet(std::string name = "Guest") {\n       std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl; // name defaults to "Guest"\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Guest!\n       greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Variadic Functions**: These functions can accept a variable number of arguments. The standard library function `printf` is a common example.\n\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cstdarg>\n   void printNumbers(int count, ...) {\n       va_list args;\n       va_start(args, count);\n       for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n           std::cout << va_arg(args, int) << " ";\n       }\n       va_end(args);\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       printNumbers(3, 1, 2, 3); // Outputs: 1 2 3\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese examples illustrate the flexibility of parameter passing in C++, allowing for various programming techniques and styles. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and effective C++ code.
