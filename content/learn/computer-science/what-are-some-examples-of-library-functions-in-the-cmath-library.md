    What are some examples of library functions in the cmath library?
answer: >-
    The `cmath` library in C++ provides a wide range of mathematical functions that are essential for performing various mathematical operations. Here are some examples of library functions available in the `cmath` library:\n\n1. **abs(x)**: Returns the absolute value of `x`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   int main() {\n       int x = -5;\n       int absoluteValue = abs(x); // absoluteValue will be 5\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **cbrt(x)**: Returns the cube root of `x`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = cbrt(27.0); // result will be 3.0\n   ```\n\n3. **ceil(x)**: Returns the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to `x`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = ceil(2.3); // result will be 3.0\n   ```\n\n4. **floor(x)**: Returns the largest integer value that is less than or equal to `x`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = floor(2.7); // result will be 2.0\n   ```\n\n5. **fabs(x)**: Returns the absolute value of a floating-point number `x`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = fabs(-3.14); // result will be 3.14\n   ```\n\n6. **copysign(x, y)**: Returns a value with the magnitude of `x` and the sign of `y`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = copysign(3.0, -1.0); // result will be -3.0\n   ```\n\n7. **fdim(x, y)**: Returns the positive difference between `x` and `y`, or zero if `x` is less than `y`.\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cmath>\n   double result = fdim(5.0, 3.0); // result will be 2.0\n   ```\n\nThese functions are part of the C++ Standard Library and can be utilized by including the header file `#include <cmath>`. They simplify mathematical calculations and enhance code readability and maintainability.
