    What are the expected results when testing coding queries for family trees?
answer: >-
    When testing coding queries for family trees, the expected results can vary based on the specific queries being executed and the underlying data structure of the family tree. Here are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1. **Correctness of Relationships**: The primary goal of testing is to ensure that the queries accurately reflect familial relationships. For example, if a query is designed to find a person's parents, the expected result should return the correct parent nodes from the family tree structure.\n\n2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: Tests should include edge cases, such as individuals without known parents or those with multiple marriages. The expected results should handle these scenarios gracefully, either by returning null values or by providing a clear indication of the absence of data.\n\n3. **Recursive Lookups**: For queries that involve recursive lookups (e.g., finding all ancestors), the expected results should include all relevant ancestors up to a specified generation. This can be validated by comparing the output against a manually constructed family tree.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Testing should also focus on how the system handles erroneous input, such as invalid IDs or malformed queries. The expected result in these cases would be an appropriate error message or exception handling that informs the user of the issue.\n\n5. **Performance Metrics**: Depending on the size of the family tree, performance testing may be necessary. The expected results should include response times for queries, ensuring they are within acceptable limits, especially for large datasets.\n\n6. **Data Integrity**: After running queries, it is essential to verify that the underlying data remains intact and that no unintended modifications have occurred during the query process.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The format of the output should be consistent and user-friendly. For instance, if a query returns a list of ancestors, the expected result should be in a structured format that is easy to read and interpret.\n\n8. **Comparison with Known Data**: If possible, the results of the queries should be compared against known data or previously validated queries to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects during testing, one can ensure that the coding queries for family trees are functioning correctly and providing reliable results.
