    What are the key differences in the implementation of Min Heap and Max Heap?
answer: >-
    The key differences in the implementation of Min Heap and Max Heap primarily revolve around the properties of the elements stored in the heaps and their respective priorities. Here are the main distinctions:\n\n1. **Root Node Value**:\n   - **Min Heap**: The value at the root node is the minimum among all the nodes in the heap. This means that every parent node must be less than or equal to its child nodes.\n   - **Max Heap**: Conversely, the value at the root node is the maximum among all the nodes. In this case, every parent node must be greater than or equal to its child nodes.\n\n2. **Heap Property**:\n   - **Min Heap**: The heap property ensures that for any given node, the value of that node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This property is maintained throughout the structure.\n   - **Max Heap**: The heap property in a Max Heap ensures that for any given node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.\n\n3. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Min Heap**: Typically used in algorithms that require frequent access to the smallest element, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths or Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.\n   - **Max Heap**: Commonly used in scenarios where the largest element needs to be accessed quickly, such as in priority queues where tasks with higher priority are processed first.\n\n4. **Insertion and Deletion**:\n   - The insertion and deletion operations in both heaps are similar in terms of complexity, generally $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the heap. However, the specific comparisons made during these operations differ based on whether the heap is a Min Heap or a Max Heap.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Both Min Heaps and Max Heaps can be implemented using arrays or binary trees. The array representation is often preferred due to its simplicity and efficiency in accessing parent and child nodes using index calculations.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental difference between Min Heap and Max Heap lies in the ordering of the elements, with Min Heap prioritizing the smallest elements and Max Heap prioritizing the largest. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate heap type for specific algorithmic needs.
