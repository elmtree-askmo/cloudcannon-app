    How is binary arithmetic performed?
answer: >-
    Binary arithmetic, particularly binary addition, is a fundamental operation in digital systems and is performed using specific rules that are analogous to decimal addition. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how binary arithmetic, especially addition, is performed:\n\n### Basic Rules of Binary Addition\nThe rules for binary addition are as follows:\n- $0 + 0 = 0$\n- $0 + 1 = 1$\n- $1 + 0 = 1$\n- $1 + 1 = 10$ (which means 0 with a carry of 1)\n- $1 + 1 + 1 = 11$ (which means 1 with a carry of 1)\n\nWhen adding two binary digits, if the sum exceeds 1, a carry is generated to the next higher bit.\n\n### Example of Binary Addition\nLet's consider an example where we add the binary numbers 1011 (which is 11 in decimal) and 1101 (which is 13 in decimal):\n\n```\n   1011\n+  1101\n-------\n```\n\nWe add from the rightmost bit to the leftmost bit:\n1. **Rightmost column**: $1 + 1 = 10$ (write down 0, carry 1)\n2. **Next column**: $1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10$ (write down 0, carry 1)\n3. **Next column**: $0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 10$ (write down 0, carry 1)\n4. **Leftmost column**: $1 + 1 (carry) = 10$ (write down 0, carry 1)\n\nFinally, we write down the carry:\n```\n   1011\n+  1101\n-------\n  11000\n```\nThe result is 11000, which is 24 in decimal.\n\n### Binary Addition in Two's Complement\nIn the context of two's complement, binary addition can also be used to add positive and negative numbers. This allows for the representation of arithmetic operations in digital logic. For instance, to subtract a number, you can convert it to its two's complement (invert the bits and add 1) and then perform binary addition.\n\n### Summary\nBinary arithmetic, particularly addition, is a straightforward process that follows specific rules. It is crucial for various applications in digital systems, including arithmetic operations in computers and electronic devices. Understanding how to perform binary addition is essential for working with binary numbers, data storage, and digital logic design.
