    Can you explain the operations associated with stacks and queues?
answer: >-
    Stacks and queues are both linear data structures that allow for the storage and manipulation of data, but they operate under different principles and have distinct operations associated with them.\n\n### Stack Operations\nA stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The essential operations for a stack include:\n\n1. **Push**: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def push(stack, item):\n       stack.append(item)\n   ```\n\n2. **Pop**: This operation removes the element from the top of the stack and returns it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def pop(stack):\n       if not stack:\n           return None  # Stack is empty\n       return stack.pop()\n   ```\n\n3. **Peek**: This operation retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def peek(stack):\n       if not stack:\n           return None  # Stack is empty\n       return stack[-1]\n   ```\n\n### Queue Operations\nA queue operates on the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. The essential operations for a queue include:\n\n1. **Enqueue**: This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def enqueue(queue, item):\n       queue.append(item)\n   ```\n\n2. **Dequeue**: This operation removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def dequeue(queue):\n       if not queue:\n           return None  # Queue is empty\n       return queue.pop(0)\n   ```\n\n3. **Peek**: This operation retrieves the front element of the queue without removing it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)\n   \n   ```python\n   def peek(queue):\n       if not queue:\n           return None  # Queue is empty\n       return queue[0]\n   ```\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Access Method**: Stacks use LIFO (Last In, First Out) while queues use FIFO (First In, First Out).\n- **Operations**: Stacks primarily use `push` and `pop`, whereas queues use `enqueue` and `dequeue`.\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Stack implementation is generally simpler than queue implementation, which can involve more complex structures like circular queues or priority queues.\n\nBoth stacks and queues are flexible in size, allowing them to grow and shrink according to runtime requirements. Their choice of use depends on the specific needs of the application, particularly whether a LIFO or FIFO behavior is required.
