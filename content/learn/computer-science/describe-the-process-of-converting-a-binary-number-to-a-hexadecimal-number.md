    To convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number, you can follow a straightforward process that leverages the direct relationship between the two number systems. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a group of four binary digits (bits). Here’s a step-by-step guide to perform the conversion:\n\n### Steps to Convert Binary to Hexadecimal\n\n1. **Group the Binary Digits**: \n   - Start from the rightmost side of the binary number and group the digits into sets of four. If the leftmost group has fewer than four digits, you can pad it with zeros on the left.\n   - For example, if you have the binary number `110101011011`, you would group it as follows:\n     ```\n     1101 0101 1011\n     ```\n\n2. **Convert Each Group to Hexadecimal**:\n   - Use a binary-to-hexadecimal conversion table to find the hexadecimal equivalent of each group of four bits. Here’s a quick reference for the conversion:\n     ```\n     Binary   | Hexadecimal\n     -----------------------\n     0000     | 0\n     0001     | 1\n     0010     | 2\n     0011     | 3\n     0100     | 4\n     0101     | 5\n     0110     | 6\n     0111     | 7\n     1000     | 8\n     1001     | 9\n     1010     | A\n     1011     | B\n     1100     | C\n     1101     | D\n     1110     | E\n     1111     | F\n     ```\n\n   - For the example `110101011011`, you would convert each group:\n     - `1101` → D\n     - `0101` → 5\n     - `1011` → B\n\n3. **Combine the Hexadecimal Digits**:\n   - After converting each group, combine the hexadecimal digits to form the final hexadecimal number. For our example:\n     - The binary number `110101011011` converts to `D5B` in hexadecimal.\n\n### Example Conversion\nLet’s convert the binary number `10101010` to hexadecimal:\n1. Group the binary digits: `1010 1010`\n2. Convert each group:\n   - `1010` → A\n   - `1010` → A\n3. Combine the results: The hexadecimal equivalent is `AA`.\n\n### Summary\nThe conversion from binary to hexadecimal is efficient due to the direct mapping of four binary bits to a single hexadecimal digit. This method is widely used in computing and digital electronics for its compact representation of binary data.
