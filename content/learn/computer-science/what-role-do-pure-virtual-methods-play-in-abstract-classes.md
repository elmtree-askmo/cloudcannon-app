    What role do pure virtual methods play in abstract classes?
answer: >-
    Pure virtual methods play a crucial role in abstract classes in C++. They serve as a mechanism to define a common interface for derived classes while enforcing specific behaviors that must be implemented by those derived classes. Here are the key points regarding pure virtual methods and their significance in abstract classes:\n\n1. **Definition**: A pure virtual function is declared in an abstract class by appending `= 0` to the function declaration. This indicates that the function does not have an implementation in the base class and must be overridden in any derived class. For example:\n   ```cpp\n   class Base {\n   public:\n       virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Abstract Classes**: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must contain at least one pure virtual function. This characteristic allows the abstract class to serve as a blueprint for derived classes, which must provide implementations for the pure virtual functions before they can be instantiated.\n\n3. **Enforcement of Implementation**: By declaring a function as pure virtual, the base class enforces that all derived classes must provide their own implementation of that function. This ensures that the derived classes adhere to a specific interface, promoting consistency and reliability in the code.\n\n4. **Polymorphism**: Pure virtual functions enable polymorphism, allowing for dynamic binding of function calls. This means that the correct function implementation is determined at runtime based on the type of the object being referenced, rather than the type of the reference itself. This is essential for designing flexible and extensible systems.\n\n5. **Design Flexibility**: The use of pure virtual methods encourages a modular design approach. It allows developers to think abstractly about the behaviors that different classes should implement, leading to better-organized and more reusable code.\n\n6. **Example**: Consider a simple example where we define an abstract class `Shape` with a pure virtual function `draw()`:\n   ```cpp\n   class Shape {\n   public:\n       virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function\n   };\n\n   class Circle : public Shape {\n   public:\n       void draw() override {\n           // Implementation for drawing a circle\n       }\n   };\n\n   class Square : public Shape {\n   public:\n       void draw() override {\n           // Implementation for drawing a square\n       }\n   };\n   ```\n   In this example, both `Circle` and `Square` must implement the `draw()` method, ensuring that any `Shape` can be drawn, regardless of its specific type.\n\nIn summary, pure virtual methods are fundamental to the concept of abstract classes in C++. They enforce a contract for derived classes, promote polymorphism, and enhance the overall design and organization of code in object-oriented programming.
