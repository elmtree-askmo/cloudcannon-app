    What command is used to configure the device name on a router?
answer: >-
    To configure the device name on a router, you would use the following command in the Command Line Interface (CLI):\n\n```plaintext\nRouter(config)# hostname R1\n```\n\nIn this example, the command changes the router's name to 'R1'. Setting a hostname is important for identifying the device within a network, especially when managing multiple routers. This command is executed in global configuration mode, which is accessed after entering the configuration mode from the privileged EXEC mode. \n\nIf you have any further questions about router configuration or related topics, feel free to ask!
