    How does dynamic typing impact type safety in programming languages?
answer: >-
    Dynamic typing significantly impacts type safety in programming languages in several ways:\n\n1. **Type Determination at Runtime**: In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This means that a variable can hold values of different types throughout its lifecycle. For example, in Python, you can assign an integer to a variable and later assign a string to the same variable without any compile-time errors:\n   ```python\n   x = 5      # x is an integer\n   x = "Hello"  # x is now a string\n   ```\n   This flexibility allows for more concise and adaptable code but can lead to unpredictable behavior if not managed carefully.\n\n2. **Error Detection**: One of the main drawbacks of dynamic typing is that type-related errors may only surface during execution, making debugging more challenging. In contrast, statically typed languages catch type mismatches at compile time, which can lead to more robust code. For instance, in a statically typed language like Java, the following code would result in a compile-time error if you tried to assign a string to an integer variable:\n   ```java\n   int x = 5;\n   x = "Hello"; // Compile-time error\n   ```\n\n3. **Potential for Runtime Errors**: Since type checks are performed at runtime in dynamically typed languages, there is a higher risk of encountering runtime errors due to type mismatches. For example, if a function expects a string but receives an integer, it may lead to a runtime exception, which can be difficult to trace back to the source of the error.\n\n4. **Flexibility vs. Safety**: Dynamic typing offers greater flexibility, allowing developers to write code that can easily adapt to changing requirements. However, this comes at the cost of type safety. Developers must be more vigilant in ensuring that variables are used correctly, as the language does not enforce type constraints at compile time.\n\n5. **Type Checking**: In dynamically typed languages, type checking occurs during execution. This means that the language runtime must perform checks to ensure that operations on variables are valid. This can introduce overhead and potentially slow down execution compared to statically typed languages, where type checking is done at compile time.\n\nIn summary, while dynamic typing provides flexibility and ease of use, it can compromise type safety by allowing type-related errors to go undetected until runtime. This necessitates a more careful approach to coding and debugging in dynamically typed languages, as developers must ensure that their code handles various types correctly to avoid runtime errors.
