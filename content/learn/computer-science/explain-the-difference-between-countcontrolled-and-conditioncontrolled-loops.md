    Explain the difference between count-controlled and condition-controlled loops.
answer: >-
    Count-controlled and condition-controlled loops are two fundamental types of loops used in programming to repeat a block of code, but they operate based on different criteria.\n\n### Count-Controlled Loops\nCount-controlled loops are designed to execute a specific number of times. The number of iterations is known before the loop starts, which allows the programmer to set a counter that tracks how many times the loop has executed. This type of loop is typically implemented using a `for` loop in many programming languages. \n\n**Characteristics:**\n- **Fixed Iterations:** The loop runs a predetermined number of times.\n- **Counter Variable:** A counter variable is used to keep track of the number of iterations.\n- **Example:** In Python, a count-controlled loop can be written as follows:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):  # This will iterate 5 times\n    print(i)\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop will print the values from 0 to 4, executing exactly five times.\n\n### Condition-Controlled Loops\nCondition-controlled loops, on the other hand, continue to execute as long as a specified condition remains true. The number of iterations is not predetermined, and the loop may run zero or more times depending on the condition being evaluated. This type of loop is commonly implemented using a `while` loop.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- **Variable Iterations:** The loop runs until a certain condition is met, which can lead to an unknown number of iterations.\n- **Condition Evaluation:** The condition is checked before each iteration (in a `while` loop) or after each iteration (in a `do-while` loop).\n- **Example:** In Python, a condition-controlled loop can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:  # This will continue until count is no longer less than 5\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop will also print the values from 0 to 4, but it will continue to execute as long as the condition `count < 5` is true.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Count-Controlled Loops:** Execute a fixed number of times; the number of iterations is known beforehand.\n- **Condition-Controlled Loops:** Execute until a condition is no longer true; the number of iterations can vary and is not known in advance.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate loop type based on the requirements of the algorithm being implemented.
