    What is the primary function of spyware?
answer: >-
    The primary function of spyware is to infiltrate a user's device and covertly gather sensitive information about their activities without their knowledge or consent. This type of malicious software operates silently in the background, collecting data such as browsing habits, keystrokes, personal information, and even payment card details. The gathered information is then transmitted to unauthorized parties, which may include fraudulent advertisers, data farms, or other third parties, thereby violating the user's privacy and potentially endangering their device's security.\n\nSpyware can capture a wide range of data, including usernames, passwords, files that have been created or accessed, and emails sent by the user. It is important to note that while spyware is a form of malware, similar behaviors can also be exhibited by legitimate software and websites that engage in tracking.\n\nTo protect against spyware, it is advisable to use reputable antimalware software that offers real-time protection, including features such as real-time scanning of downloads and email attachments, web protection to block access to known malicious websites, and behavior-based detection to identify new threats.
