    What is the basic syntax for writing a 'Hello World' script in Bash?
answer: >-
    To write a basic "Hello World" script in Bash, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open a Text Editor**: Use any text editor of your choice, such as `nano`, `vi`, or `gedit`.\n\n2. **Write the Script**: Start by typing the following lines into the editor:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   # This is a simple Bash script that prints "Hello World!"\n   echo "Hello World!"\n   ```\n\n   - The first line `#!/bin/bash` is known as the shebang. It indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.\n   - The second line is a comment (preceded by `#`) that describes what the script does.\n   - The third line uses the `echo` command to print "Hello World!" to the terminal.\n\n3. **Save the File**: Save the file with a `.sh` extension, for example, `hello.sh`.\n\n4. **Make the Script Executable**: Before running the script, you need to give it execute permissions. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x hello.sh\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the Script**: Finally, execute the script by typing:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./hello.sh\n   ```\n\nWhen you run the script, it will output:\n\n```\nHello World!\n```\n\nCongratulations! You have just created and executed your first Bash script. This simple exercise is a great way to get started with Bash scripting and understand its basic syntax.
