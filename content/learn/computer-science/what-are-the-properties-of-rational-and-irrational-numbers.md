    What are the properties of rational and irrational numbers?
answer: >-
    Rational and irrational numbers are two fundamental categories of real numbers, each with distinct properties. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of their properties:\n\n### Properties of Rational Numbers\n1. **Definition**: Rational numbers can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. This means they can be represented as a ratio of two integers.\n\n2. **Closure Property**: Rational numbers are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except division by zero). This means that performing these operations on rational numbers will always yield another rational number.\n\n3. **Commutative Property**: For any two rational numbers $x$ and $y$:\n   - Addition: $x + y = y + x$\n   - Multiplication: $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$\n\n4. **Associative Property**: For any three rational numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n   - Addition: \((x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\)\n   - Multiplication: \((x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)\)\n\n5. **Identity Property**: \n   - The additive identity is 0, since $x + 0 = x$ for any rational number $x$.\n   - The multiplicative identity is 1, since $x \cdot 1 = x$ for any rational number $x$.\n\n6. **Inverse Property**: \n   - The additive inverse of a rational number $\frac{x}{y}$ is $-\frac{x}{y}$.\n   - The multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal) is $\frac{y}{x}$ (provided $x \neq 0$).\n\n### Properties of Irrational Numbers\n1. **Definition**: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. They are represented by non-terminating and non-repeating decimal expansions.\n\n2. **Non-closure under Operations**: \n   - The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always irrational. For example, if $x$ is irrational and $y$ is rational, then $x + y$ is irrational.\n   - The product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is also irrational.\n\n3. **Examples**: Common examples of irrational numbers include $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, and $e$. These numbers cannot be precisely expressed as fractions.\n\n4. **Properties of Real Numbers**: Irrational numbers follow all the properties of real numbers, including the properties of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but they do not maintain closure under these operations when combined with other irrational numbers.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, rational numbers are characterized by their ability to be expressed as fractions and their closure under basic arithmetic operations. In contrast, irrational numbers are defined by their non-repeating, non-terminating decimal nature and their inability to be expressed as a simple fraction. Understanding these properties is crucial for distinguishing between the two types of numbers in mathematics.
