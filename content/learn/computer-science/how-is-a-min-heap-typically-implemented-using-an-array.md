    How is a min heap typically implemented using an array?
answer: >-
    A min heap is typically implemented using an array, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of elements while maintaining the heap property. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this implementation works:\n\n### Structure of a Min Heap\nA min heap is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than or equal to its children. This property ensures that the smallest element is always at the root of the tree. In an array representation, the elements of the heap are stored in a contiguous block of memory, which simplifies the management of the heap structure.\n\n### Array Representation\nIn an array-based implementation of a min heap:\n- The root of the heap is stored at index 0 (or index 1, depending on the indexing convention).\n- For a node at index $k$:\n  - The left child is located at index $2k + 1$ (for 0-based indexing) or $2k$ (for 1-based indexing).\n  - The right child is located at index $2k + 2$ (for 0-based indexing) or $2k + 1$ (for 1-based indexing).\n  - The parent of a node at index $k$ can be found at index $\lfloor (k - 1) / 2 \rfloor$ (for 0-based indexing) or $\lfloor k / 2 \rfloor$ (for 1-based indexing).\n\n### Example of Min Heap in an Array\nConsider the following min heap represented as an array:\n```\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8]\n```\nIn this example:\n- The root (1) is at index 0.\n- The left child of 1 (3) is at index 1, and the right child (5) is at index 2.\n- The left child of 3 (7) is at index 3, and the right child (9) is at index 4.\n- The left child of 5 (8) is at index 5.\n\n### Operations on Min Heap\n1. **Insertion**: To insert a new element, it is added at the end of the array (the next available position). The heap property is then restored by "bubbling up" the new element, swapping it with its parent until the heap property is satisfied. The time complexity for insertion is $O(\log n)$.\n\n2. **Deletion (Extract Min)**: To remove the minimum element (the root), the last element in the array is moved to the root position, and then the heap property is restored by "bubbling down" this element, swapping it with the smaller of its children until the heap property is satisfied. The time complexity for deletion is also $O(\log n)$.\n\n3. **Heapify**: This operation is used to build a heap from an arbitrary array. Starting from the last non-leaf node, each node is adjusted to maintain the heap property, which can be done in linear time, $O(n)$.\n\n### Efficiency of Array-Based Heap Implementation\nThe array-based implementation of a min heap is efficient in terms of both time and space:\n- **Time Complexity**: Insertion and deletion operations both run in $O(\log n)$ time, while building the heap can be done in $O(n)$ time.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is $O(n)$, as all elements must be stored in the array.\n\nThis array-based approach is widely used in priority queue implementations and is favored for its simplicity and efficiency.
