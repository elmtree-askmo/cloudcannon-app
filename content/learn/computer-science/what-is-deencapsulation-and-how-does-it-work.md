    De-encapsulation is the process in networking that involves removing protocol-specific headers and trailers from received data, allowing the original payload to be presented to the application layer for processing.

    What is de-encapsulation and how does it work?
answer: >-
    De-encapsulation, also known as decapsulation, is a fundamental process in networking that occurs when data is received over a network. It is the reverse of data encapsulation, which involves wrapping data with protocol-specific headers and trailers for transmission. Hereâ€™s how de-encapsulation works:\n\n1. **Receiving Data**: When a packet arrives at its destination, it is received at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model or the TCP/IP model. The data is in the form of bits that represent the encapsulated information.\n\n2. **Layered Process**: The de-encapsulation process occurs as the packet moves up through the layers of the OSI or TCP/IP model. Each layer is responsible for removing its corresponding header or trailer that was added during the encapsulation process.\n\n3. **Header and Trailer Removal**: \n   - At the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**, the data link header and trailer are removed, which typically contain information such as the source and destination MAC addresses.\n   - At the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**, the network header is removed, which includes the source and destination IP addresses.\n   - At the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**, the transport header is removed, which may contain information about the source and destination ports and the protocol used (e.g., TCP or UDP).\n   - This process continues until the data reaches the **Application Layer (Layer 7)**, where the original data (payload) is presented to the application.\n\n4. **Final Output**: The end result of de-encapsulation is the retrieval of the original data that was sent by the source computer. This data is now in a format that can be understood and processed by the receiving application.\n\nIn summary, de-encapsulation is a critical process that ensures data can be correctly interpreted by the receiving system, allowing for effective communication across networks. Each layer in the networking model plays a specific role in this process, systematically removing the encapsulation added during transmission.
