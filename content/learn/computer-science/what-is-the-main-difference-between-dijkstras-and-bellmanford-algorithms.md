    What is the main difference between Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms?
answer: >-
    The main difference between Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms lies in their handling of edge weights and their approach to finding the shortest paths in a graph.\n\n1. **Edge Weight Handling**:\n   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This algorithm is designed to work with graphs that have non-negative edge weights. It cannot handle graphs with negative weight edges, as it assumes that once a vertex's shortest path is found, it will not change. This is due to its greedy approach, which selects the vertex with the smallest tentative distance at each step.\n   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: In contrast, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle graphs with negative weight edges. It is capable of detecting negative weight cycles, which Dijkstra's algorithm cannot do. This makes Bellman-Ford more versatile in scenarios where negative weights are present.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Approach**:\n   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: It uses a priority queue to explore the most promising paths first, iteratively selecting the vertex with the smallest tentative distance and updating the distances of its adjacent vertices. The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is typically \(O(E + V \log V)\) when implemented with a priority queue, where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices.\n   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: This algorithm works by relaxing all edges repeatedly. It goes through all edges and updates the distance to each vertex if a shorter path is found. This process is repeated $V-1$ times (where $V$ is the number of vertices) to ensure that the shortest paths are found. The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is \(O(VE)\).\n\n3. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: It is typically used in applications where all edge weights are non-negative, such as in GPS navigation systems for finding the shortest route.\n   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: It is useful in scenarios where negative weights are present, such as in certain financial models or when dealing with graphs that may have negative cycles.\n\nIn summary, the choice between Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms depends on the characteristics of the graph being analyzed, particularly regarding edge weights.
