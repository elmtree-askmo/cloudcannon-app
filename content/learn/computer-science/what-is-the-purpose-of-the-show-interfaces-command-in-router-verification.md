    What is the purpose of the 'show interfaces' command in router verification?
answer: >-
    The `show interfaces` command is a crucial router verification command used to display detailed statistics and operational status for all interfaces on a router. This command provides comprehensive information that helps network administrators assess the health and performance of each interface.\n\n### Purpose of the `show interfaces` Command:\n\n1. **Detailed Interface Statistics**: The command outputs various statistics for each interface, including:\n   - Input and output packet counts\n   - Error counts (e.g., CRC errors, input errors)\n   - Interface status (up or down)\n   - Line protocol status (up or down)\n   - Bandwidth and MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) settings\n\n2. **Operational Status**: It helps in determining whether an interface is operational and if it is experiencing any issues. For example, if an interface is down, the command will indicate this, allowing for quick troubleshooting.\n\n3. **Traffic Analysis**: By providing input and output statistics, network administrators can analyze traffic patterns and identify potential bottlenecks or issues related to bandwidth.\n\n4. **Configuration Verification**: The command can be used to verify that the interface configurations (such as IP addressing and encapsulation types) are correctly applied and functioning as intended.\n\n5. **Troubleshooting**: If there are connectivity issues, the `show interfaces` command can help pinpoint problems by revealing errors and operational statuses that may indicate misconfigurations or hardware failures.\n\n### Example Output:\nWhen you run the command, the output might look something like this:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter# show interfaces\nGigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\n  Hardware is Gigabit Ethernet, address is 00a1.b2c3.d4e5 (bia 00a1.b2c3.d4e5)\n  Internet address is 192.168.1.1/24\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit/sec, DLY 10 usec,\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\n  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set\n  ...\n```\n\nIn summary, the `show interfaces` command is essential for monitoring and managing router interfaces, providing vital information that aids in maintaining network performance and reliability.
