answer: >-
    The binary representation of a subnet mask is crucial for understanding how it divides an IP address into its network and host portions. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is typically represented in dotted-decimal format, similar to an IP address. Each bit in the subnet mask corresponds to a bit in the IP address.\n\n### Structure of a Subnet Mask\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: The subnet mask consists of a series of '1' bits followed by a series of '0' bits. The '1' bits indicate the network portion of the address, while the '0' bits indicate the host portion. For example:\n   - A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 corresponds to the binary representation:\n     $$\n     11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n     $$\n   - This means that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, and the last 8 bits are used for the host portion.\n\n2. **Subnet Mask Examples**:\n   - **/24** (255.255.255.0): The first 24 bits are for the network, and the last 8 bits are for hosts.\n   - **/16** (255.255.0.0): The first 16 bits are for the network, and the last 16 bits are for hosts.\n   - **/8** (255.0.0.0): The first 8 bits are for the network, and the last 24 bits are for hosts.\n\n### How the Subnet Mask Divides the Network\n\nThe division of the network and host portions is determined by the position of the '1's and '0's in the subnet mask. The transition point from '1' to '0' in the binary representation indicates where the network portion ends and the host portion begins. \n\nFor example, consider the following IP address and subnet mask:\n- **IP Address**: 10.20.30.40 (in binary: 00001010.00010100.00011110.00101000)\n- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.240.0 (in binary: 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000)\n\nIn this case:\n- The first 20 bits (the '1's in the subnet mask) represent the network portion.\n- The remaining 12 bits (the '0's in the subnet mask) represent the host portion.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe subnet mask is essential for determining which part of an IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the individual host. By using the binary representation of the subnet mask, devices can effectively route packets within a network and ensure that communication occurs correctly between devices. Understanding this structure is fundamental for network design and management.
