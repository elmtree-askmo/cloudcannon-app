    How does multi-client rescheduling work in the Astraea framework?
answer: >-
    In the Astraea framework, multi-client rescheduling is a key strategy designed to address the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions in federated learning (FL). This framework employs a mediator-based approach to effectively manage and optimize the data distribution among multiple clients.\n\n### How Multi-client Rescheduling Works in Astraea\n\n1. **Mediator Role**: The mediator acts as an intermediary that oversees the data distribution among clients. It ensures that the training data is balanced across different clients, which is crucial for improving the overall performance of the federated learning model.\n\n2. **Dynamic Rescheduling**: The framework dynamically adjusts the scheduling of clients based on their data distribution. This means that clients with underrepresented classes in their local datasets may be prioritized for training sessions, while those with more balanced or overrepresented classes may be deprioritized. This adaptive scheduling helps to mitigate the effects of data imbalance.\n\n3. **Data Augmentation Integration**: The rescheduling process is complemented by global data distribution-based data augmentation strategies. By augmenting the data at a global level, Astraea can enhance the training datasets of clients that are lagging, further balancing the learning process.\n\n4. **Runtime Adjustments**: The framework allows for runtime adjustments to the client scheduling based on real-time assessments of data distribution. This ensures that the learning process remains efficient and effective, adapting to any changes in the data landscape as training progresses.\n\n5. **Balancing Local Imbalances**: In addition to addressing global imbalances, the mediator also focuses on averaging local imbalances among clients. This dual approach ensures that both global and local data distributions are considered, leading to a more robust federated learning process.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the Astraea framework enhances the communication efficiency and overall performance of federated learning systems, making it a significant advancement in handling imbalanced data challenges.
