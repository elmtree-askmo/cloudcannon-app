    What were the key features of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah released in the mid-2000s?
answer: >-
    Mac OS X 10.0, code-named Cheetah, was released on March 24, 2001, and marked a significant milestone in Apple's operating system history as it was the first official release of Mac OS X following the Public Beta. Here are the key features of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah:\n\n1. **Aqua User Interface**: Cheetah introduced the Aqua interface, which was a visually appealing design featuring translucent menus, drop shadows, and a vibrant color palette. This interface was a departure from the previous Mac OS and aimed to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience.\n\n2. **The Dock**: A new feature that allowed users to organize and access applications easily. The Dock provided a space for frequently used applications and documents, enhancing user productivity.\n\n3. **Preemptive Multitasking**: This technology allowed the operating system to manage multiple tasks more efficiently, improving overall system responsiveness and performance.\n\n4. **Protected Memory**: Cheetah introduced protected memory, which helped prevent applications from interfering with each other, thereby increasing system stability.\n\n5. **Built-in Applications**: The operating system came with several built-in applications, including Mail, Address Book, and TextEdit, which provided users with essential tools right out of the box.\n\n6. **Support for Classic Environment**: Users could run Mac OS 9 applications in a Classic environment, allowing for a smoother transition for those who were still reliant on older software.\n\n7. **System Requirements**: Cheetah required a minimum of 128 MB of RAM, which was relatively high for the time, but it allowed the OS to utilize its features effectively.\n\n8. **Lack of Some Features**: While Cheetah was a significant advancement, it lacked certain features that users had come to expect, such as DVD support and native third-party applications, which led to mixed reviews regarding its readiness for the masses.\n\nOverall, Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah laid the groundwork for future versions of macOS, introducing a new era of operating systems for Apple that emphasized both aesthetics and functionality.
