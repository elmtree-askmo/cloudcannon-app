    How are functions with parameters but no return value structured?
answer: >-
    In C++, functions that have parameters but do not return a value are typically defined with a return type of `void`. This structure allows the function to accept input parameters while performing a specific task without providing any output back to the caller. \n\nThe general syntax for such a function is as follows:\n\n```cpp\nvoid functionName(parameterType1 parameter1, parameterType2 parameter2) {\n    // Function body: code to perform the task\n}\n```\n\n### Example of a Function with Parameters but No Return Value\n\nHere is a simple example of a user-defined function in C++ that takes two integer parameters and prints their sum, but does not return any value:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid printSum(int a, int b) {\n    cout << "The sum is: " << (a + b) << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printSum(5, 10); // Calling the function with arguments\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Function Declaration**: The function `printSum` is declared with a return type of `void`, indicating that it does not return a value.\n2. **Parameters**: It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of type `int`.\n3. **Function Body**: Inside the function, the sum of `a` and `b` is calculated and printed to the console.\n4. **Function Call**: In the `main` function, `printSum` is called with the arguments `5` and `10`.\n\n### Importance of Functions with Parameters\n\nUsing functions with parameters allows for greater modularity and reusability in code. They enable programmers to write more flexible and maintainable code by encapsulating functionality that can be reused with different inputs. This approach also helps in reducing code duplication and improving readability.\n\nIn summary, functions with parameters but no return value are structured using the `void` return type, allowing them to perform operations based on the input parameters without returning any data to the caller.
