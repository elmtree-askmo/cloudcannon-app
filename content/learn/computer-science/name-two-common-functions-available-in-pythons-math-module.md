    Name two common functions available in Python's math module.
answer: >-
    Two common functions available in Python's math module are:\n\n1. **`math.ceil(x)`**: This function rounds `x` to the smallest integer that is not less than `x`. For example:\n   ```python\n   import math\n   print(math.ceil(9.2))  # Output: 10\n   ```\n\n2. **`math.floor(x)`**: This function rounds `x` to the largest integer that is not greater than `x`. For example:\n   ```python\n   import math\n   print(math.floor(9.8))  # Output: 9\n   ```\n\nThese functions are useful for performing mathematical operations that require rounding numbers in different ways.
