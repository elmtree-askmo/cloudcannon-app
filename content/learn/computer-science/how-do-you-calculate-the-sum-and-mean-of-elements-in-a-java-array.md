    How do you calculate the sum and mean of elements in a Java array?
answer: >-
    To calculate the sum and mean (average) of elements in a Java array, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**: First, you need to create an array and populate it with values.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum**: Use a loop to iterate through the array and accumulate the sum of its elements.\n\n3. **Calculate the Mean**: Divide the sum by the number of elements in the array to get the mean.\n\nHere is a sample Java program that demonstrates this process:\n\n```java\npublic class ArraySumAndAverage {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Step 1: Declare and initialize the array\n        int[] myArray = {1, 5, 10, 25};\n        \n        // Step 2: Calculate the sum\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {\n            sum += myArray[i];\n        }\n        \n        // Step 3: Calculate the mean\n        double mean = (double) sum / myArray.length;\n        \n        // Output the results\n        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);\n        System.out.println("Mean: " + mean);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Array Declaration**: The array `myArray` is initialized with integer values.\n- **Sum Calculation**: A `for` loop iterates through each element of the array, adding each element to the `sum` variable.\n- **Mean Calculation**: The mean is calculated by dividing the `sum` by the length of the array. Note that we cast `sum` to `double` to ensure that the division results in a decimal value if necessary.\n\n### Alternative Method Using Java Streams:\nIf you are using Java 8 or later, you can also calculate the sum and mean using the Stream API:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class ArraySumAndAverage {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] myArray = {1, 5, 10, 25};\n\n        // Using Streams to calculate sum and average\n        double sum = Arrays.stream(myArray).sum();\n        double mean = Arrays.stream(myArray).average().orElse(0.0);\n\n        // Output the results\n        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);\n        System.out.println("Mean: " + mean);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `Arrays.stream(myArray).sum()` computes the sum, and `Arrays.stream(myArray).average()` computes the mean, returning an `OptionalDouble` which we handle with `orElse(0.0)` to provide a default value in case the array is empty.\n\nThis approach is more concise and leverages the power of Java's functional programming capabilities.
