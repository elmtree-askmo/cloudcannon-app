    The most commonly used basic command-line commands in Windows Command Prompt (CMD) include a variety of commands that facilitate file management, system configuration, and troubleshooting. Hereâ€™s a list of some essential commands:\n\n1. **dir**: Displays a list of files and directories in the current directory.\n   ```cmd\n   dir\n   ```\n\n2. **cd**: Changes the current directory. For example, to change to the "Documents" directory:\n   ```cmd\n   cd Documents\n   ```\n\n3. **mkdir**: Creates a new directory. For example, to create a directory named "NewFolder":\n   ```cmd\n   mkdir NewFolder\n   ```\n\n4. **rmdir**: Removes a directory. To remove a directory named "OldFolder":\n   ```cmd\n   rmdir OldFolder\n   ```\n\n5. **copy**: Copies files from one location to another. For example, to copy a file named "file.txt" to "backup.txt":\n   ```cmd\n   copy file.txt backup.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **move**: Moves files from one location to another. For example, to move "file.txt" to the "Documents" folder:\n   ```cmd\n   move file.txt Documents\\n   ```\n\n7. **del**: Deletes one or more files. For example, to delete "file.txt":\n   ```cmd\n   del file.txt\n   ```\n\n8. **cls**: Clears the Command Prompt screen.\n   ```cmd\n   cls\n   ```\n\n9. **exit**: Closes the Command Prompt window.\n   ```cmd\n   exit\n   ```\n\n10. **help**: Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.\n    ```cmd\n    help\n    ```\n\n11. **tasklist**: Displays a list of currently running processes.\n    ```cmd\n    tasklist\n    ```\n\n12. **taskkill**: Terminates a running process. For example, to kill a process with the name "notepad.exe":\n    ```cmd\n    taskkill /IM notepad.exe\n    ```\n\n13. **ipconfig**: Displays the current network configuration, including IP address and subnet mask.\n    ```cmd\n    ipconfig\n    ```\n\n14. **ping**: Tests connectivity to a specific IP address or hostname. For example, to ping Google's DNS server:\n    ```cmd\n    ping 8.8.8.8\n    ```\n\n15. **chkdsk**: Checks the file system and file system metadata of a volume for logical and physical errors. For example, to check the C: drive:\n    ```cmd\n    chkdsk C:\n    ```\n\nThese commands are fundamental for users who want to navigate and manage their systems effectively through the command line. Each command can have various options and parameters that modify its behavior, making them powerful tools for both novice and advanced users.
