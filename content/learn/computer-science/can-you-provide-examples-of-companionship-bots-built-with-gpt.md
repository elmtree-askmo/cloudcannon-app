answer: >-
    Companionship bots built with GPT and other language models have gained popularity for their ability to engage users in friendly and supportive conversations. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Pi**: Developed by Inflection AI, Pi is designed as a digital companion that provides emotional support and serves as a sounding board for users. It aims to be a curious and kind counterpart, available whenever users want to learn something new or just pass the time.\n\n2. **Character AI**: This platform allows users to create and interact with various characters, each powered by GPT technology. Users can engage in conversations with these characters, making it a fun and entertaining way to experience companionship through AI.\n\n3. **Kindroid**: This AI companion app offers a user-friendly interface for setting up a personalized AI companion. Users can customize their interactions, making it a solid choice for those looking for a friendly conversational partner.\n\n4. **Viam-powered Companion Robots**: By integrating ChatGPT with robotics, developers can create physical companion robots that can listen, respond, and interact with users in real-time. These robots can convert speech to text, generate responses using GPT, and then convert the text back to speech, creating a lifelike interaction.\n\n5. **Grok**: Developed by xAI, Grok is designed to provide humorous and engaging conversations, making it a unique option for users looking for a light-hearted companion.\n\nThese companionship bots leverage the capabilities of GPT to provide users with engaging, supportive, and interactive experiences, showcasing the potential of AI in enhancing social interactions.
