    How can you implement a text box in a Tkinter application?
answer: >-
    To implement a text box in a Tkinter application, you can use either the `Text` widget for multi-line text input or the `Entry` widget for single-line text input. Below are examples of how to create both types of text boxes.\n\n### Using the Text Widget (Multi-line)\n\nThe `Text` widget is suitable for scenarios where you need to allow users to input or display multiple lines of text. Here’s a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the root window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Create a Text widget\ntext_box = tk.Text(root)\ntext_box.pack()\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the Tkinter module and create a root window. We then create a `Text` widget instance, pack it into the window, and launch the main event loop, which displays an empty multi-line text box.\n\n### Using the Entry Widget (Single-line)\n\nIf you only need to accept a single line of text, you can use the `Entry` widget. Here’s how to create it:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the root window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Create an Entry widget\nentry_box = tk.Entry(root)\nentry_box.pack()\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an `Entry` widget, which allows the user to input a single line of text. Similar to the `Text` widget, we pack it into the window and start the main event loop.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Use the `Text` widget for multi-line text input.\n- Use the `Entry` widget for single-line text input.\n\nBoth widgets can be customized with various options, such as font size, color, and padding, to enhance the user interface.
