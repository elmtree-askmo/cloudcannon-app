    Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, released on August 23, 2002, marked a significant advancement over its predecessor, Mac OS X 10.1. Here are the key improvements and features introduced in Jaguar:\n\n1. **Performance Enhancements**: Jaguar brought substantial raw performance improvements, making the operating system faster and more responsive. This was particularly noticeable in applications and system operations.\n\n2. **User Interface Enhancements**: The update included over 150 user-interface enhancements, contributing to a sleeker and more modern look. These enhancements improved the overall user experience and made the system more visually appealing.\n\n3. **Quartz Extreme**: One of the standout features of Jaguar was the introduction of Quartz Extreme, which allowed for hardware-accelerated graphics rendering. This feature enabled compositing graphics directly on supported video cards (such as the ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX) with at least 16 MB of VRAM, resulting in smoother graphics and improved performance in graphic-intensive applications.\n\n4. **New Applications**: Jaguar introduced several new applications, including:\n   - **iChat**: An instant messaging client that allowed users to communicate with others using AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) and later supported other protocols.\n   - **Address Book**: A system-wide repository for contact information, making it easier for users to manage their contacts across different applications.\n\n5. **Startup Changes**: The traditional "Happy Mac" icon that appeared during the startup sequence for nearly 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo, marking a visual shift in the boot process.\n\n6. **Enhanced Features**: Jaguar also included improvements to existing features, such as better support for networking and file sharing, enhanced printing capabilities, and improved support for various hardware peripherals.\n\nOverall, Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar represented a significant step forward in terms of performance, usability, and visual design, setting a strong foundation for future versions of the operating system.
