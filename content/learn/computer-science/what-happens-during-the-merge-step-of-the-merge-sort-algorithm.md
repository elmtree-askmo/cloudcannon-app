    What happens during the merge step of the merge sort algorithm?
answer: >-
    During the merge step of the merge sort algorithm, two sorted subarrays are combined into a single sorted array. This step is crucial as it ensures that the final output is sorted. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what happens during this process:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Two pointers are initialized, one for each of the two sorted subarrays. These pointers will track the current position in each subarray.\n\n2. **Comparison**: The algorithm compares the elements at the current positions of the two pointers. The smaller element is selected and placed into a new array that will hold the merged result.\n\n3. **Advancing Pointers**: After placing the smaller element into the new array, the pointer for that subarray is advanced to the next element.\n\n4. **Continuation**: This comparison and placement process continues until one of the subarrays is completely traversed.\n\n5. **Appending Remaining Elements**: Once one of the subarrays is exhausted, the remaining elements from the other subarray (which are already sorted) are appended to the new array.\n\n6. **Final Output**: The new array, which now contains all elements from both subarrays in sorted order, is then copied back to the original array segment that was being sorted.\n\nThis merging process is repeated recursively until the entire array is sorted. The efficiency of the merge step is a key reason why the overall time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This complexity arises because the array is divided log(n) times, and each merge operation involves looking at all n elements. \n\nIn summary, the merge step is essential for combining sorted subarrays into a larger sorted array, ensuring that the final output of the merge sort algorithm is correctly ordered.
