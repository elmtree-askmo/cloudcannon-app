    When is the double colon notation used in IPv6 addresses, and what is its limitation?
answer: >-
    The double colon notation (::) in IPv6 addresses is used to simplify the representation of addresses by replacing contiguous segments of zeros. This notation is particularly useful because IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and can be quite lengthy when fully expressed in hexadecimal format. \n\n### Purpose of Double Colon Notation\nThe double colon can replace any single contiguous string of one or more 16-bit hextets that consist entirely of zeros. For example, the full IPv6 address:\n\n```\n2001:0db8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200\n```\n\ncan be compressed to:\n\n```\n2001:db8:0:1111::200\n```\n\nThis makes the address more readable and manageable.\n\n### Limitation of Double Colon Notation\nThe primary limitation of the double colon notation is that it can only be used once in an address. This restriction is crucial to avoid ambiguity. If the double colon were allowed to be used multiple times, it would be impossible to determine how many hextets of zeros were represented by each instance of the double colon. For instance, the address `2001:db8::1::2` would be ambiguous because it is unclear how many hextets of zeros are represented by each double colon.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the double colon notation is a valuable tool for simplifying IPv6 address representation, but its use is limited to a single occurrence within an address to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.
