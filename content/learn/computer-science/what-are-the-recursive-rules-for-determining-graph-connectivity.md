    What are the recursive rules for determining graph connectivity?
answer: >-
    To determine graph connectivity using recursive rules, we can employ a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The fundamental idea is to start from a specific node and recursively explore all reachable nodes. If we can visit all nodes in the graph from the starting node, then the graph is considered connected.\n\n### Recursive Approach to Determine Graph Connectivity\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a node (let's call it `start_node`) and maintain a set or list to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function that:\n   - Marks the current node as visited.\n   - Iterates through all neighbors of the current node.\n   - For each unvisited neighbor, recursively calls the function.\n\n3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when there are no unvisited neighbors left to explore.\n\n4. **Check Connectivity**: After the recursive traversal, check if all nodes have been visited. If they have, the graph is connected; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nHere is a simple Python implementation of the recursive approach using DFS:\n\n```python\ndef dfs(graph, node, visited):\n    """Recursive DFS function to explore the graph."""\n    visited.add(node)  # Mark the current node as visited\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Explore each neighbor\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor hasn't been visited\n            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)  # Recursively visit it\n\ndef is_connected(graph):\n    """Check if the graph is connected."""\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    start_node = next(iter(graph))  # Get an arbitrary starting node\n    dfs(graph, start_node, visited)  # Start DFS from the start node\n    return len(visited) == len(graph)  # Check if all nodes were visited\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- The `dfs` function takes the graph, the current node, and the set of visited nodes as arguments. It marks the current node as visited and recursively visits all its unvisited neighbors.\n- The `is_connected` function initializes the visited set, selects a starting node, and calls the `dfs` function. Finally, it checks if the number of visited nodes equals the total number of nodes in the graph.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing this recursive approach, we can effectively determine the connectivity of a graph. If all nodes are reachable from the starting node, the graph is connected; otherwise, it is disconnected. This method is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of graph traversal algorithms.
