answer: >-
    The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) significantly improves upon the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) primarily in terms of computational efficiency. Here are the key differences and advantages of FFT over DFT:\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**: \n   - The DFT has a time complexity of $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of data points. This means that as the size of the input increases, the time taken to compute the DFT increases quadratically.\n   - In contrast, the FFT reduces this complexity to $O(N \log N)$. This is achieved by breaking down the DFT into smaller DFTs, which allows for the reuse of previously computed results, thus significantly speeding up the computation.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Structure**:\n   - The FFT algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. It recursively divides the DFT into smaller DFTs, which are easier and faster to compute. For example, it combines pairs of points and then groups them, effectively reducing the number of computations needed.\n   - The FFT takes advantage of the periodic properties of the complex exponential functions used in the DFT, allowing it to combine results from smaller transforms efficiently.\n\n3. **Reusability of Computations**:\n   - The FFT algorithm recognizes the periodic nature of the DFT and reuses computations from half-length transforms. This means that many calculations are shared between different parts of the algorithm, which is not the case with the straightforward DFT computation.\n\n4. **Practical Applications**:\n   - Due to its efficiency, the FFT is widely used in various applications such as signal processing, image analysis, and solving partial differential equations. It allows for real-time processing of signals and is essential in applications where speed is critical.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - The FFT can be implemented in various ways, with the Cooley-Tukey algorithm being one of the most common. This algorithm recursively breaks down the DFT into smaller DFTs, making it highly efficient for large datasets.\n\nIn summary, the FFT is an efficient algorithm for computing the DFT, reducing the computational time from quadratic to logarithmic complexity, which is crucial for handling large datasets in practical applications.
