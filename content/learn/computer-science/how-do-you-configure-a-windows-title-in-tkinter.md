    How do you configure a window's title in Tkinter?
answer: >-
    To configure a window's title in Tkinter, you can use the `title()` method on the Tk window object. This method allows you to set a specific string value that will be displayed in the title bar of the application window. \n\nHereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to set the title of a Tkinter window:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Set the title of the window\nroot.title("My Application")\n\n# Start the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `title()` method is called with the string "My Application" as an argument, which will change the title displayed in the title bar of the window. This is a straightforward way to customize the appearance of your application's window and improve user experience by providing a descriptive title.
