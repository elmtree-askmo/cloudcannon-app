    Can you provide an example of a DFA diagram?
answer: >-
    Here is an example of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) diagram that accepts strings with an odd number of 'a's followed by an even number of 'b's, but at least two 'b's:\n\n```\nStates: q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5\nTransitions:\n- From q0:\n  - On 'a' → q1\n  - On 'b' → q0\n- From q1:\n  - On 'a' → q0\n  - On 'b' → q2\n- From q2:\n  - On 'a' → q3\n  - On 'b' → q0\n- From q3:\n  - On 'a' → q2\n  - On 'b' → q4\n- From q4:\n  - On 'a' → q5\n  - On 'b' → q0\n- From q5:\n  - On 'a' → q4\n  - On 'b' → q0\n\nFinal States: q2, q4\n```\n\nIn this DFA:\n- The initial state is q0.\n- The final states are q2 and q4, which indicate that the string has an odd number of 'a's followed by an even number of 'b's.\n- The transitions between states are determined by the input symbols 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThis diagram can be represented graphically with circles for states and arrows for transitions, where the final states are denoted by double circles. The initial state can be marked with an arrow pointing to it from nowhere. \n\nThis example illustrates the basic principles of a DFA and how it processes input strings based on defined transitions.
