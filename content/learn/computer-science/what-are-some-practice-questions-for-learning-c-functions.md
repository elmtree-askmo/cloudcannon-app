    What are some practice questions for learning C++ functions?
answer: >-
    Here are some practice questions for learning C++ functions, particularly focusing on user-defined functions and their applications:\n\n1. **Prime Number Function**: Write a program that defines a function to print all the prime numbers between two given numbers. The function should take two integer parameters and return nothing.\n\n2. **Leap Year Checker**: Create a user-defined function that checks whether a given year is a leap year. The function should take an integer parameter (the year) and return a boolean value indicating whether it is a leap year.\n\n3. **Character Checker**: Write a function that takes a character as input and checks whether it is an alphabet or not. The function should return a boolean value.\n\n4. **Vowel or Consonant**: Define a function that takes a character as input and checks whether it is a vowel or consonant. The function should return a string indicating the result.\n\n5. **Factorial Calculation**: Implement a function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The function should take an integer parameter and return the factorial as an integer.\n\n6. **Fibonacci Series**: Write a function that generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The function should take an integer parameter (number of terms) and print the series.\n\n7. **Sum of Array Elements**: Create a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters, and returns the sum of the elements in the array.\n\n8. **String Length Function**: Define a function that takes a string as input and returns its length without using the built-in `length()` function.\n\n9. **Reverse a String**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of that string.\n\n10. **Sorting an Array**: Implement a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters, and sorts the array in ascending order using a sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort).\n\nThese practice questions cover a range of topics related to functions in C++, including parameter usage, return types, and practical programming tasks. They are designed to help beginners understand the structure and syntax of user-defined functions while applying them to solve common programming problems.
