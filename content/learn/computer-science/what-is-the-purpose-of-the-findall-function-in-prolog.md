    What is the purpose of the `findall` function in Prolog?
answer: >-
    The `findall` function in Prolog is a powerful built-in predicate used to collect all possible solutions to a specified goal and store them in a list. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the retrieval of multiple solutions that satisfy a given condition, allowing for more complex queries and data manipulation.\n\nThe syntax for `findall` is as follows:\n\n```prolog\nfindall(+Template, :Goal, -Bag)\n```\n\n- **Template**: This is the structure that defines what you want to collect from the solutions of the goal.\n- **Goal**: This is the condition or query you want to evaluate.\n- **Bag**: This is the list that will be unified with all the instantiations of the Template that are found by backtracking over the Goal.\n\nWhen `findall` is executed, it creates a list of all the instantiations of the Template that are generated as Prolog backtracks through the Goal. If there are no solutions to the Goal, `findall` will return an empty list. This behavior is particularly useful when you want to gather results without affecting the state of the program or the variables involved.\n\nFor example, if you want to find all descendants of a particular individual in a family tree, you could use `findall` to collect all names that satisfy the descendant condition:\n\n```prolog\nfindall(Descendant, descendant(Martha, Descendant), DescendantsList).\n```\n\nIn this case, `DescendantsList` will contain all individuals who are descendants of Martha.\n\nIt's important to note that the first two arguments of `findall` typically share at least one variable in common, which helps in identifying the relevant solutions. Additionally, `findall` is equivalent to `bagof` but differs in that `bagof` fails if there are no solutions, while `findall` will always succeed, returning an empty list in such cases.\n\nOverall, `findall` is an essential tool in Prolog for collecting and managing multiple solutions efficiently, making it easier to work with complex data and queries.
