    What are the basics that need to be installed on Debian?
answer: >-
    To set up a basic Debian system, there are several essential packages and utilities that you may want to install after the initial installation. Hereâ€™s a guide on the basics that need to be installed on Debian:\n\n### Basic Utilities\n1. **Package Managers**:\n   - `apt`: The primary package manager for installing and managing software packages.\n   - `apt-get`: A command-line tool for handling packages.\n   - `dpkg`: The low-level package manager for Debian-based systems.\n\n2. **System Utilities**:\n   - `initscripts`: Manages the initialization scripts for the system.\n   - `sudo`: Allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user.\n\n### Development Tools\nIf you plan to do any development work, consider installing:\n- `gcc`: The GNU Compiler Collection, which includes the C compiler.\n- `make`: A build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code.\n\n### Recommended Applications\nAfter installing the basic system, you might want to enhance your Debian experience with some essential applications:\n- **Productivity Tools**: \n  - `libreoffice`: A powerful office suite.\n- **Multimedia Software**:\n  - `gimp`: A free and open-source image editor.\n  - `vlc`: A versatile media player that supports various audio and video formats.\n\n### Installation Commands\nTo install these packages, you can use the following commands in the terminal:\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install sudo initscripts gcc make libreoffice gimp vlc\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Drivers**: If you are using proprietary hardware (like Nvidia graphics cards), you may want to install proprietary drivers for better performance.\n- **Software Sources**: Ensure that you have enabled the necessary software sources in your package manager to access a wider range of applications.\n\n### Conclusion\nDebian is a robust operating system with a vast repository of software packages. The above list provides a solid foundation for a basic Debian installation, allowing you to expand and customize your system according to your needs. After setting up these essentials, you can explore further packages and tools that suit your specific use cases.
