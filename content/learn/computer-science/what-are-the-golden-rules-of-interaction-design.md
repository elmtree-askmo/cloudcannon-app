    What are the golden rules of interaction design?
answer: >-
    The "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design," formulated by Ben Shneiderman, serve as essential guidelines for creating effective and user-friendly interfaces in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). These rules are designed to enhance usability and improve the overall user experience. Here are the eight golden rules:\n\n1. **Strive for Consistency**: Ensure that similar actions require similar sequences, and use consistent terminology across prompts, menus, and help screens. This helps users predict the behavior of the interface.\n\n2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**: Allow experienced users to take shortcuts, such as keyboard shortcuts or command-line inputs, to enhance their efficiency and satisfaction.\n\n3. **Offer Informative Feedback**: Provide users with feedback about their actions. This can include visual cues, sounds, or messages that confirm the completion of an action or indicate the status of a process.\n\n4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**: Design interactions that provide a clear indication of completion. Users should feel that they have successfully completed a task, which can be achieved through confirmation messages or visual indicators.\n\n5. **Prevent Errors**: Design the interface to minimize the chances of user errors. This can include disabling irrelevant options, providing clear instructions, and using confirmation dialogs for critical actions.\n\n6. **Permit Easy Reversal of Actions**: Allow users to undo actions easily. This reduces anxiety and encourages exploration, as users feel more comfortable experimenting with the interface.\n\n7. **Support Internal Locus of Control**: Users should feel that they are in control of the interface. Design should empower users to make choices and navigate the system according to their preferences.\n\n8. **Reduce Short-Term Memory Load**: Minimize the amount of information that users need to remember at one time. This can be achieved through clear labeling, logical grouping of information, and the use of visual aids.\n\nThese rules are foundational in the field of interaction design and are widely referenced in user-centered design practices. They help ensure that interfaces are not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable for users.
