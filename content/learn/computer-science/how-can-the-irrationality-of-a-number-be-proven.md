answer: >-
    To prove the irrationality of a number, one of the most famous methods is proof by contradiction. A classic example of this is the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational. Hereâ€™s how the proof works:\n\n1. **Assumption**: Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. This means it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, say $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1), and $b \neq 0$.\n\n2. **Equation Setup**: From the assumption, we can write:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\n   $$\n   Squaring both sides gives:\n   $$\n   2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \implies a^2 = 2b^2\n   $$\n\n3. **Implication**: This equation implies that $a^2$ is even (since it is equal to $2b^2$, which is clearly even). If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ must also be even (because the square of an odd number is odd).\n\n4. **Substitution**: Since $a$ is even, we can express it as $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this back into the equation gives:\n   $$\n   (2k)^2 = 2b^2 \implies 4k^2 = 2b^2 \implies b^2 = 2k^2\n   $$\n\n5. **Conclusion**: This shows that $b^2$ is also even, which means $b$ must be even as well. \n\n6. **Contradiction**: Since both $a$ and $b$ are even, they have a common factor of 2, which contradicts our original assumption that $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\nThus, we conclude that our initial assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false, and therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nThis method can be generalized to prove the irrationality of other numbers, such as $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, and so on, by following a similar structure of proof by contradiction.
