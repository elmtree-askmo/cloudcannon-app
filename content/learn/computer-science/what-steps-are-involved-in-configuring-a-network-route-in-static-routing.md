answer: >-
    To configure a static route in IPv6, you can follow these steps, which are similar to those used for IPv4 static routing. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Enable IPv6 Routing**: First, you need to enable IPv6 routing on the router. This is done in global configuration mode. For example:\n   ```plaintext\n   R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing\n   R2(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure IPv6 Addresses on Interfaces**: Assign IPv6 addresses to the router interfaces that will participate in the routing. Ensure that the addresses are correctly configured with the appropriate subnet prefix (e.g., /64).\n\n3. **Configure the Static IPv6 Route**: Use the `ipv6 route` command to define the static route. You will specify the destination network, the prefix length, and the next-hop address. The syntax is as follows:\n   ```plaintext\n   R1(config)# ipv6 route <destination-network> <prefix-length> <next-hop-address>\n   ```\n   For example, to configure a static route to the network `2001:db8:1::/64` with a next-hop address of `2001:db8:2::1`, you would enter:\n   ```plaintext\n   R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::/64 2001:db8:2::1\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Configuration**: After configuring the static route, you should verify that it has been correctly added to the routing table. You can do this using the following command:\n   ```plaintext\n   R1# show ipv6 route\n   ```\n   Look for the entry corresponding to the static route you just configured, which should be marked with an "S" in the routing table.\n\n5. **Troubleshooting**: If the static route does not appear in the routing table or if connectivity issues arise, check the following:\n   - Ensure that IPv6 is enabled on all relevant interfaces.\n   - Verify that the next-hop address is reachable.\n   - Check for any misconfigurations in the IPv6 addresses or prefixes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully configure static routes in an IPv6 network. Static routing is particularly useful in smaller networks or specific scenarios where dynamic routing protocols are not necessary.
