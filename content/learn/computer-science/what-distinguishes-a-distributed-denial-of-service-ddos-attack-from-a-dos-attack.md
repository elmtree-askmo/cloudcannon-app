    What distinguishes a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a DoS attack?
answer: >-
    The primary distinction between a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack lies in the number of attacking sources involved and the scale of the attack.\n\n1. **Source of Attack**:\n   - A **DoS attack** is executed from a single computer or device. The attacker overwhelms the target system with a flood of requests, which can exhaust the system's resources and render it unavailable to legitimate users.\n   - In contrast, a **DDoS attack** utilizes multiple computers or devices, often part of a botnetâ€”a network of compromised machines controlled by the attacker. This allows the DDoS attack to generate a significantly larger volume of traffic directed at the target from various locations simultaneously.\n\n2. **Impact and Complexity**:\n   - Because a DDoS attack can draw on the resources of many devices, it can deliver a much more powerful and sustained assault compared to a DoS attack. This makes DDoS attacks more challenging to defend against, as they can come from numerous points, complicating the identification and mitigation of the attack.\n   - DDoS attacks can also be coordinated with other types of attacks, such as ransomware, where the target is rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid.\n\n3. **Execution Time**:\n   - A DoS attack may require more time to execute effectively, as the attacker needs sufficient bandwidth to overwhelm the target. In contrast, DDoS attacks can be launched quickly and with greater intensity due to the distributed nature of the attacking devices.\n\nIn summary, while both DoS and DDoS attacks aim to disrupt services and make systems unavailable, the key differences lie in the number of attacking sources, the scale of the attack, and the complexity involved in defending against them.
