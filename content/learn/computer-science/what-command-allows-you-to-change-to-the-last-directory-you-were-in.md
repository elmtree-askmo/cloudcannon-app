    What command allows you to change to the last directory you were in?
answer: >-
    To change to the last directory you were in while using the Bash shell, you can use the command:\n\n```bash\ncd -\n```\n\nThis command allows you to quickly navigate back to the previous working directory. When executed, it switches your current directory to the one you were in before the last `cd` command was run. This is particularly useful for quickly toggling between two directories.\n\nAdditionally, if you find yourself using this command frequently, you can create an alias in your `~/.bashrc` file to make it even easier. For example, you could add the following line:\n\n```bash\nalias cdc='cd -'\n```\n\nWith this alias, you can simply type `cdc` to return to your last directory, saving you some keystrokes.
