    What are traps in the context of processor interrupts?
answer: >-
    In the context of processor interrupts, traps are a specific type of software-invoked interrupt. They are signals raised by a user program that instruct the operating system (OS) to perform certain functions immediately. Unlike hardware interrupts, which are asynchronous events triggered by external hardware (such as I/O devices), traps are synchronous events that originate from within the software itself.\n\nWhen a trap occurs, the CPU transfers control to the kernel and executes a designated trap handler. This handler is responsible for determining the type of trap and taking appropriate actions, which may include terminating the program or executing a privileged operation on behalf of the user program. \n\nTraps are crucial for various functionalities, including system calls, where a program requests services from the OS, and they play a significant role in debugging. They allow the OS to manage control flow and ensure that user programs can safely request resources or services that require higher privileges.\n\nIn summary, while both traps and interrupts signal the CPU to take action, traps are specifically tied to software events and are integral to the interaction between user programs and the operating system.
