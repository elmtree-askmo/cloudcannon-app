answer: >-
    The command that provides a brief overview of the status of all interfaces on a router is:\n\n```plaintext\nshow ip interface brief\n```\n\nThis command displays a summary of the interfaces, including their IP addresses and operational status (up or down). It is commonly used for quick verification of interface configurations and statuses. \n\nFor example, you would enter the command in the router's command line interface (CLI) as follows:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter# show ip interface brief\n```\n\nThis will yield an output that summarizes the key information for all network interfaces on the router, making it an essential tool for network administrators to quickly assess the state of the router's interfaces.
