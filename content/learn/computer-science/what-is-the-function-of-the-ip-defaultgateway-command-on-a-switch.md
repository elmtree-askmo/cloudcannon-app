    The 'ip default-gateway' command configures the default gateway on a switch, enabling it to send packets to devices outside its local subnet, thus facilitating remote management and communication in different networks.

    What is the function of the 'ip default-gateway' command on a switch?
answer: >-
    The `ip default-gateway` command on a switch is used to configure the default gateway for the switch itself. This is essential for enabling the switch to communicate with devices that are located on different networks. \n\nWhen a switch needs to send packets to a device outside its local subnet, it forwards those packets to the default gateway, which is typically the IP address of a router interface that connects to the local network. This allows for remote management of the switch from other networks, as the switch will know where to send packets that are destined for addresses outside its own subnet.\n\nTo configure a default gateway on a switch, you would use the following command in global configuration mode:\n\n```plaintext\nSwitch(config)# ip default-gateway ip-address\n```\n\nFor example, if the router's interface IP address is `192.168.10.1`, you would configure the switch like this:\n\n```plaintext\nSwitch(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.10.1\n```\n\nThis command sets the default gateway for the switch, allowing it to route traffic appropriately when communicating with devices on different networks. Without this configuration, the switch would not be able to send packets to devices outside its local network, which could hinder network management and communication.
