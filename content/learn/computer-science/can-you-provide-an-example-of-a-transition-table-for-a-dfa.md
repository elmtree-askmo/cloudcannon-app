    Can you provide an example of a transition table for a DFA?
answer: >-
    A transition table for a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) provides a clear representation of how the automaton transitions between states based on input symbols. Here is an example of a transition table for a DFA:\n\n| Present State | Next State for Input 0 | Next State for Input 1 |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| →q0           | q1                      | q2                      |\n| q1            | q0                      | q1                      |\n| q2            | q1                      | q2                      |\n\n### Explanation:\n- The first column lists the current states of the DFA. The arrow (→) indicates the start state, which is `q0` in this case.\n- The second column shows the next state when the input symbol is `0`, and the third column shows the next state when the input symbol is `1`.\n- For example, if the DFA is in state `q0` and receives input `0`, it transitions to state `q1`. If it receives input `1`, it transitions to state `q2`.\n- The states `q1` and `q2` also have their own transitions defined based on the input symbols.\n\nThis table format allows for easy understanding and implementation of the DFA's behavior, as each state has a deterministic transition for each possible input symbol.
