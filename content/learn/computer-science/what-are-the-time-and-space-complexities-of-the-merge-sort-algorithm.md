    What are the time and space complexities of the merge sort algorithm?
answer: >-
    The time and space complexities of the merge sort algorithm are as follows:\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of merge sort is consistent across best, average, and worst-case scenarios. It is expressed as:\n\n- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \log N)\)\n\nThis complexity arises because the algorithm divides the array into two halves recursively (which takes \(O(\log N)\) time) and then merges the sorted halves, which takes \(O(N)\) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be represented by the recurrence relation:\n\n$$\nT(N) = 2 \cdot T\left(\frac{N}{2}\right) + O(N)\n$$\n\nSolving this recurrence gives us the \(O(N \log N)\) time complexity.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity of merge sort is primarily due to the auxiliary space required for merging the sorted subarrays. It is expressed as:\n\n- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\)\n\nDuring the merge process, merge sort requires an auxiliary array to hold the elements being merged. This auxiliary array is of size $N$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the original array. Although the algorithm may involve multiple recursive calls, the space used for the auxiliary array remains \(O(N)\) since it is allocated once for the entire merge operation.\n\nIn summary, merge sort has a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\) and a space complexity of \(O(N)\). This makes it efficient for sorting large datasets, especially when stability (preserving the order of equal elements) is a requirement.
