answer: >-
    To find subnet IDs with fewer than 8 subnet bits, you can follow a formal process that simplifies the identification of these subnets. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Subnet Mask\nStart by writing down the subnet mask in decimal format. This mask will help you determine which bits are used for the network and which are used for hosts.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Interesting Octet\nIdentify the octet in the subnet mask that has a value other than 255 or 0. This octet is referred to as the "interesting octet." If the mask defines exactly 8 subnet bits, you will need to apply different logic to identify this octet.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Magic Number\nSubtract the value of the interesting octet from 256 to find the "magic number." This number will be used to calculate the subnet IDs.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Subnet IDs\nStarting from the base network address (the first address in the subnet), add the magic number to the interesting octet. Repeat this process until you reach the maximum value for that octet (which is 256). Each result will give you a subnet ID.\n\nFor example, if your subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 (which has 3 subnet bits), the interesting octet is the last octet (224). The magic number is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n256 - 224 = 32\n$$\n\nStarting from the base network address (e.g., 192.168.1.0), the subnet IDs would be:\n\n- 192.168.1.0\n- 192.168.1.32\n- 192.168.1.64\n- 192.168.1.96\n- 192.168.1.128\n- 192.168.1.160\n- 192.168.1.192\n- 192.168.1.224\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Subnet IDs\nEnsure that the calculated subnet IDs do not exceed the range of the network and that they are valid based on the subnet mask used.\n\nThis process allows you to systematically find all subnet IDs for a given network when fewer than 8 subnet bits are used.
