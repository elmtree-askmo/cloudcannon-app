    How do firewalls and antivirus software contribute to cybersecurity?
answer: >-
    Firewalls and antivirus software are critical components of cybersecurity, each serving distinct but complementary roles in protecting computer systems, networks, and data from various cyber threats.\n\n### Firewalls\n\n1. **Traffic Control**: Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. By blocking unauthorized access and filtering out potentially harmful traffic, firewalls help prevent attacks such as unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n2. **Blocking Malicious Traffic**: Firewalls can block unwanted network traffic, which reduces the likelihood of malware installation. By preventing unauthorized connections, they help protect systems from external threats.\n\n3. **Network Security**: Firewalls contribute to overall network security by creating a secure infrastructure for devices and applications to operate. They can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both, and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the network.\n\n### Antivirus Software\n\n1. **Malware Detection and Removal**: The primary function of antivirus software is to identify and eliminate malicious software (malware), including viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware. It scans files and programs for known threats and can also detect suspicious behavior indicative of new or unknown malware through heuristic analysis.\n\n2. **Real-Time Protection**: Antivirus software provides continuous monitoring of the system, ensuring that threats are detected and addressed as they occur. This real-time protection is crucial for preventing malware from infecting devices.\n\n3. **Regular Updates**: To remain effective against evolving malware threats, antivirus software requires regular updates. These updates ensure that the software's database of known threats is current, allowing it to detect the latest malware.\n\n4. **Additional Security Features**: Many antivirus solutions come with extra features, such as firewalls, password managers, and tools for protecting against ransomware and phishing attacks. This multi-layered approach enhances overall security.\n\n5. **System Performance Monitoring**: Some antivirus programs monitor system performance and can alert users to potential issues caused by malware, such as unusual spikes in CPU or memory usage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, firewalls and antivirus software work together to create a robust cybersecurity framework. Firewalls protect the network perimeter by controlling traffic and blocking unauthorized access, while antivirus software focuses on detecting and removing malware within the system. Together, they help safeguard sensitive data and maintain the integrity of computer systems against a wide range of cyber threats.
