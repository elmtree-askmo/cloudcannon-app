    Computability theory is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on the question of which problems can be solved by algorithms and which cannot. It addresses the limits of what can be computed, exploring the nature of computational problems and the theoretical foundations of algorithmic processes. The scope of computability theory includes:\n\n1. **Defining Computable Functions**: It establishes what it means for a function to be computable, often using models such as Turing machines, recursive functions, and lambda calculus.\n\n2. **Identifying Non-computable Problems**: It identifies problems that cannot be solved by any algorithm, such as the Halting Problem, which states that there is no general algorithm that can determine whether a given program will finish running or continue indefinitely.\n\n3. **Classification of Problems**: Problems are classified based on their computability, leading to distinctions between decidable and undecidable problems.\n\n4. **Relationship to Complexity Theory**: While computability theory focuses on whether a problem can be solved, complexity theory examines how efficiently a problem can be solved once it is known to be computable. This includes analyzing the resources (time and space) required by algorithms to solve problems.\n\nThe relationship between computability theory and problem solvability is crucial. A problem must first be computable for it to be considered solvable by an algorithm. Once a problem is established as computable, complexity theory then comes into play to evaluate how efficiently it can be solved. \n\nFor example, the P vs NP problem, a central question in complexity theory, asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly (in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly. This question directly ties back to computability, as it deals with the nature of problem-solving capabilities of algorithms.\n\nIn summary, computability theory provides the foundational understanding of what can be computed, while complexity theory builds on this foundation to explore the efficiency of those computations. Together, they form a comprehensive framework for understanding computational problems and their solutions.
