    How can Scheme scripts interact with users through input and output?
answer: >-
    In Scheme, user interaction through input and output can be achieved using several built-in functions that facilitate reading from and writing to ports. Here’s a detailed overview of how Scheme scripts can interact with users:\n\n### Input Operations\n1. **Reading Input**: The primary function for reading user input in Scheme is `read`. This function waits for the user to type something and returns a single S-expression. For example:\n   ```scheme\n   (define user-input (read))\n   ```\n   This will read an input from the user and store it in the variable `user-input`.\n\n2. **Character Input**: For reading characters one at a time, you can use `read-char`. This function retrieves a single character from the input port:\n   ```scheme\n   (define char-input (read-char))\n   ```\n\n3. **End of Input**: If the input operations reach the end of a finite stream, they return a special end-of-file (eof) object. This can be checked to handle cases where no more input is available:\n   ```scheme\n   (if (eof-object? (read))\n       (display "End of input reached."))\n   ```\n\n### Output Operations\n1. **Writing Output**: To output data to the user, you can use the `display` function, which prints a string or value to the current output port:\n   ```scheme\n   (display "Hello, user!")\n   ```\n\n2. **Writing to Files**: Scheme also allows writing to files using output ports. You can open a file for writing and use `write` or `write-line` to output data:\n   ```scheme\n   (call-with-output-file "output.txt"\n     (lambda (port)\n       (write "This is a line of text." port)))\n   ```\n\n3. **Closing Ports**: After finishing input or output operations, it is good practice to close the ports using `close-input-port` or `close-output-port` to free up resources.\n\n### Example of User Interaction\nHere’s a simple example that combines reading user input and displaying output:\n```scheme\n(display "Please enter your name: ")\n(define name (read))\n(display "Hello, ")\n(display name)\n(display "!")\n```\n\n### Summary\nScheme provides a straightforward way to interact with users through input and output operations. By using functions like `read`, `read-char`, `display`, and file handling procedures, you can create interactive scripts that respond to user input effectively.
