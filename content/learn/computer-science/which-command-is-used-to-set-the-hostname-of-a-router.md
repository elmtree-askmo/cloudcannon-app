    Which command is used to set the hostname of a router?
answer: >-
    To set the hostname of a router, you would use the following command in the Command Line Interface (CLI):\n\n```plaintext\nRouter(config)# hostname R1\n```\n\nIn this example, the command changes the router's name to 'R1'. Setting a unique hostname is an important step in router configuration as it helps in identifying the device within a network, especially when managing multiple routers. \n\nThe general syntax for the command is:\n\n```\nhostname <name>\n```\n\nWhere `<name>` is the desired hostname you want to assign to the router. This command is typically executed in global configuration mode, which is accessed after entering privileged EXEC mode.
