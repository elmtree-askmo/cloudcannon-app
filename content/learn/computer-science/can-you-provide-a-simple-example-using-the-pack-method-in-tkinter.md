    Can you provide a simple example using the pack() method in Tkinter?
answer: >-
    Certainly! The `pack()` method in Tkinter is a geometry manager that organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget. It is particularly useful for simple layouts where you want to stack widgets vertically or horizontally.\n\nHereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the `pack()` method to create a basic GUI with buttons arranged vertically:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title("Pack Example")\n\n# Create buttons\nbutton1 = tk.Button(root, text="Button 1")\nbutton2 = tk.Button(root, text="Button 2")\nbutton3 = tk.Button(root, text="Button 3")\n\n# Pack buttons into the window\nbutton1.pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.X)  # Fill horizontally\nbutton2.pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.X)  # Fill horizontally\nbutton3.pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.X)  # Fill horizontally\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Importing Tkinter**: We start by importing the Tkinter module.\n- **Creating the main window**: We create a main window using `tk.Tk()`.\n- **Creating buttons**: We create three buttons with different text labels.\n- **Packing the buttons**: We use the `pack()` method to arrange the buttons vertically. The `side=tk.TOP` argument places each button at the top of the window, and `fill=tk.X` makes each button expand to fill the entire width of the window.\n- **Starting the event loop**: Finally, we call `root.mainloop()` to run the application.\n\nThis example illustrates how the `pack()` method can be used to create a simple vertical layout of buttons in a Tkinter application. You can modify the `side` and `fill` options to achieve different layouts as needed.
