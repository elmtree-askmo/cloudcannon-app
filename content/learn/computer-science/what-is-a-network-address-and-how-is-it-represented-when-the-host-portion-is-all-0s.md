    What is a network address and how is it represented when the host portion is all 0s?
answer: >-
    A network address is a specific type of IP address that identifies a network segment within a larger network. It is used to route traffic to the correct subnet and is essential for the organization of IP addresses in a hierarchical manner. The network address is derived from an IP address by setting all bits in the host portion to 0.\n\nWhen the host portion of an IPv4 address is all 0s, it represents the network address itself. For example, if we have an IP address of 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (or /24), the network address would be 192.168.1.0. This is because the last octet (the host portion) is set to 0, indicating that we are referring to the entire network rather than a specific host within that network.\n\nIn binary terms, if we take the IP address 192.168.1.10, it is represented as:\n\n```\n11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010\n```\n\nWith a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which in binary is:\n\n```\n11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n```\n\nThe network address is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask:\n\n```\n11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 (Network Address: 192.168.1.0)\n```\n\nThus, the network address is represented as 192.168.1.0 when the host portion is all 0s. This address is used to identify the entire subnet and is not assigned to any individual device within that subnet.
