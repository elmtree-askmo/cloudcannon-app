    How do you implement a swap method for arrays in Java?
answer: >-
    To implement a swap method for arrays in Java, you can create a method that takes an array and two indices as parameters. This method will swap the elements at the specified indices. Below is a simple implementation of such a method:\n\n```java\npublic class ArraySwapExample {\n    public static void swap(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {\n        // Check if indices are within the bounds of the array\n        if (index1 < 0 || index1 >= array.length || index2 < 0 || index2 >= array.length) {\n            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index is out of bounds");\n        }\n        \n        // Swap the elements\n        int temp = array[index1];\n        array[index1] = array[index2];\n        array[index2] = temp;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        System.out.println("Array before swap: " + java.util.Arrays.toString(arr));\n        \n        // Swap elements at index 1 and 3\n        swap(arr, 1, 3);\n        \n        System.out.println("Array after swap: " + java.util.Arrays.toString(arr));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Method Definition**: The `swap` method takes an integer array and two indices as parameters.\n2. **Bounds Checking**: It checks if the provided indices are within the valid range of the array. If not, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n3. **Swapping Logic**: It uses a temporary variable to hold one of the values while swapping the two elements.\n4. **Main Method**: In the `main` method, an example array is created, and the `swap` method is called to swap two elements. The array is printed before and after the swap to demonstrate the effect.\n\n### Alternative Methods:\n- **Using Bitwise Operators**: You can also swap two integers without a temporary variable using bitwise XOR, but this is less common and can be less readable.\n- **Using Collections**: If you are working with an `ArrayList`, you can use `Collections.swap()` to swap elements easily.\n\nThis method is essential for various algorithms, especially sorting algorithms, where swapping elements is a common operation.
