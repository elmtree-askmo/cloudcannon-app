    How is manual memory deallocation handled in C++?
answer: >-
    In C++, manual memory deallocation is a critical aspect of memory management that allows developers to have fine-grained control over how memory is used. Unlike languages such as Java or C#, where memory management is handled automatically by the runtime environment, C++ requires developers to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory.\n\n### Memory Allocation and Deallocation\n\nIn C++, memory is typically allocated on the heap using the `new` operator and deallocated using the `delete` operator. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how this works:\n\n1. **Allocation**: When you create an object dynamically, you use the `new` operator. For example:\n   ```cpp\n   MyClass* myClass = new MyClass();\n   ```\n   This allocates memory for an instance of `MyClass` on the heap.\n\n2. **Deallocation**: To free the memory that was allocated, you must use the `delete` operator:\n   ```cpp\n   delete myClass;\n   ```\n   This not only deallocates the memory but also calls the destructor of the object, allowing for any necessary cleanup.\n\n3. **Array Deallocation**: If you allocate an array, you should use `delete[]` to deallocate it:\n   ```cpp\n   int* set = new int[100]; // Allocate an array of 100 integers\n   delete[] set;            // Deallocate the array\n   ```\n\n### Risks of Manual Memory Management\n\nWhile manual memory management provides flexibility, it also introduces risks:\n\n- **Memory Leaks**: If you forget to deallocate memory, it can lead to memory leaks, where memory that is no longer needed is not returned to the system.\n- **Dangling Pointers**: If you attempt to access memory after it has been deallocated, you may encounter undefined behavior or program crashes.\n- **Uninitialized Memory**: Using pointers that have not been initialized can lead to unpredictable results.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo mitigate these risks, developers should follow best practices such as:\n\n- Always ensure that every `new` has a corresponding `delete`.\n- Use smart pointers (like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`) from the C++ Standard Library, which automate memory management and help prevent leaks.\n- Regularly review and test code to identify and fix memory management issues.\n\nIn summary, manual memory deallocation in C++ is handled through the use of `new` and `delete` operators, requiring careful management by the developer to avoid common pitfalls associated with dynamic memory allocation.
