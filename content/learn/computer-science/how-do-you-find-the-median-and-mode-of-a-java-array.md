    How do you find the median and mode of a Java array?
answer: >-
    To find the median and mode of a Java array, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Finding the Median\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: The first step in finding the median is to sort the array. The median is defined as the middle value of a sorted array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n2. **Calculate the Median**:\n   - If the number of elements (N) is odd, the median is the element at index `N/2`.\n   - If N is even, the median is the average of the elements at indices `N/2 - 1` and `N/2`.\n\nHere is a sample Java code to calculate the median:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class MedianCalculator {\n    public static double findMedian(int[] array) {\n        Arrays.sort(array); // Sort the array\n        int n = array.length;\n        if (n % 2 == 0) {\n            // If even, return the average of the two middle elements\n            return (array[n / 2 - 1] + array[n / 2]) / 2.0;\n        } else {\n            // If odd, return the middle element\n            return array[n / 2];\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2};\n        System.out.println("Median: " + findMedian(numbers));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Finding the Mode\n\n1. **Count Frequencies**: To find the mode, you need to count how many times each number appears in the array.\n\n2. **Determine the Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently. If no number is repeated, then the dataset has no mode.\n\nHere is a sample Java code to calculate the mode:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class ModeCalculator {\n    public static Integer findMode(int[] array) {\n        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int num : array) {\n            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);\n        }\n\n        int mode = array[0];\n        int maxCount = 0;\n        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {\n            if (entry.getValue() > maxCount) {\n                maxCount = entry.getValue();\n                mode = entry.getKey();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check if there is no mode\n        if (maxCount == 1) {\n            return null; // No mode\n        }\n        return mode;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5};\n        System.out.println("Mode: " + findMode(numbers));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Median**: Sort the array and find the middle value(s).\n- **Mode**: Count the frequency of each element and identify the one with the highest count.\n\nThis approach provides a clear and efficient way to calculate both the median and mode of an array in Java.
