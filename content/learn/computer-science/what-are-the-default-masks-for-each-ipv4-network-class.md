    What are the default masks for each IPv4 network class?
answer: >-
    The default subnet masks for each class of IPv4 networks are as follows:\n\n1. **Class A**:\n   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0\n   - **CIDR Notation**: /8\n   - **Network ID Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0\n   - **Usable Hosts per Network**: Approximately 16,777,214\n\n2. **Class B**:\n   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0\n   - **CIDR Notation**: /16\n   - **Network ID Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0\n   - **Usable Hosts per Network**: Approximately 65,534\n\n3. **Class C**:\n   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0\n   - **CIDR Notation**: /24\n   - **Network ID Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0\n   - **Usable Hosts per Network**: 254\n\nThese default subnet masks are used to determine the network and host portions of an IP address in classful addressing. Each class has a specific range of addresses and a corresponding default mask that dictates how many bits are allocated for the network and how many for the host.
