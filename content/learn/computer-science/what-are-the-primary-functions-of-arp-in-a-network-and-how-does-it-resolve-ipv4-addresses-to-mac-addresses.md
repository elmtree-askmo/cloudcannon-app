    The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) plays a crucial role in network communication, particularly in the context of IPv4 addressing. Its primary functions are:\n\n1. **Resolving IPv4 Addresses to MAC Addresses**: ARP translates an IPv4 address, which is used at the network layer, into a MAC address, which is used at the data link layer. This is essential for devices on the same local area network (LAN) to communicate effectively. When a device wants to send data to another device, it needs to know the MAC address of the destination device.\n\n2. **Maintaining an ARP Table**: ARP keeps an ARP table that maps IPv4 addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses. This table allows devices to quickly look up the MAC address associated with a known IPv4 address, reducing the need for repeated ARP requests.\n\n### How ARP Resolves IPv4 Addresses to MAC Addresses\n\nWhen a device needs to send a frame to another device on the same network, it follows these steps:\n\n- **Check the ARP Table**: The sending device first checks its ARP table to see if it already has the MAC address corresponding to the destination IPv4 address. If the MAC address is found, the device can directly send the frame.\n\n- **Send an ARP Request**: If the MAC address is not found in the ARP table, the device broadcasts an ARP request packet to all devices on the local network. This request contains the IPv4 address for which the MAC address is being sought.\n\n- **Receive ARP Reply**: The device that
