    What role do global variables play in code readability and maintainability?
answer: >-
    Global variables play a significant role in code readability and maintainability, but their use comes with both advantages and disadvantages that developers must carefully consider.\n\n### Advantages of Global Variables:\n1. **Accessibility**: Global variables can be accessed from any part of the program, which can simplify the sharing of data across multiple functions without needing to pass parameters explicitly.\n2. **Ease of Modification Tracking**: By explicitly declaring a variable as global, modifications to that variable can be easier to track, which can be beneficial when managing global state.\n\n### Disadvantages of Global Variables:\n1. **Obscured Program Flow**: Reliance on global variables can obscure the flow of a program. When functions modify global variables, it becomes challenging to determine where and how the variable's value changes, complicating debugging and maintenance efforts.\n2. **Namespace Clutter**: Global variables can clutter the global namespace, leading to potential name collisions and making it easy to forget where a variable was declared. This can result in accidental re-declarations and unpredictable behavior.\n3. **Reduced Modularity**: The use of global variables can reduce the modularity of code. Functions that depend on global state are less reusable and harder to test in isolation, as they rely on external variables that may change unexpectedly.\n4. **Concurrency Issues**: In multi-threaded applications, global variables can lead to race conditions if multiple threads attempt to read and write to the same variable simultaneously. This necessitates additional mechanisms, such as locks, to ensure thread safety, further complicating the code.\n\n### Best Practices:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with global variables, developers should consider the following best practices:\n- **Limit Access**: Minimize the number of global variables and restrict access to them as much as possible. This can help reduce the potential for conflicts and unintended side effects.\n- **Use Descriptive Names**: Global variables should have clear and descriptive names to convey their purpose, which can aid in understanding the code.\n- **Prefer Local Variables**: Whenever possible, use local variables and function parameters instead of global variables. This promotes better encapsulation and makes the code easier to maintain and understand.\n\nIn summary, while global variables can provide convenience in certain scenarios, their impact on code readability and maintainability is often negative. Developers are encouraged to use them sparingly and to adopt practices that enhance code clarity and robustness.
