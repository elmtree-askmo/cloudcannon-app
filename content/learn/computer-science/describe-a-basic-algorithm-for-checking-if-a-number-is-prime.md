    Describe a basic algorithm for checking if a number is prime.
answer: >-
    To check if a number is prime, you can use a basic algorithm that follows these steps:\n\n1. **Check if the number is less than or equal to 1**: If it is, the number is not prime.\n2. **Check for factors**: Loop through all integers from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime.\n3. **Return the result**: If no factors are found, the number is prime.\n\nHere is a simple implementation of this algorithm in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class PrimeChecker {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 29; // Example number to check\n        System.out.println(number + " is prime: " + isPrime(number));\n    }\n\n    private static boolean isPrime(int n) {\n        // Prime checking logic\n        if (n <= 1) return false; // Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) { // Check for factors up to the square root of n\n            if (n % i == 0) return false; // If n is divisible by i, it's not prime\n        }\n        return true; // If no factors were found, n is prime\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The `isPrime` method first checks if the number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `false`.\n- It then uses a `for` loop to check for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. The reason for checking only up to the square root is that if `n` has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor must be smaller than the square root.\n- If any factor is found (i.e., `n % i == 0`), the method returns `false`, indicating that `n` is not prime.\n- If no factors are found, the method returns `true`, indicating that `n` is prime.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient for checking the primality of a number, especially for smaller values. For larger numbers, more advanced techniques may be employed to improve efficiency.
