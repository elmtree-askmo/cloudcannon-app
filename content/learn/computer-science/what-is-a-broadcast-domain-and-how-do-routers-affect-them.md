    What is a broadcast domain and how do routers affect them?
answer: >-
    A **broadcast domain** is a logical division of a network where all devices can receive broadcast messages sent by any other device within that same domain. This means that if a device sends a broadcast message, all other devices within the same broadcast domain will receive it. Broadcast domains are crucial for understanding how network traffic is managed and how devices communicate within a network.\n\n**Routers** play a significant role in managing broadcast domains. Unlike switches, which propagate broadcast messages to all devices within the same local area network (LAN), routers do not forward broadcast messages. Each interface on a router connects to a separate broadcast domain. Therefore, when a router connects two different networks, it effectively creates two distinct broadcast domains. This separation prevents broadcasts from one network from affecting the other, which can help reduce unnecessary traffic and improve overall network performance.\n\nFor example, if you have two networks connected by a router, any broadcast sent from a device in the first network will not be received by devices in the second network. This capability is essential for managing network traffic, enhancing security, and improving performance by limiting the scope of broadcast traffic.\n\nIn summary, broadcast domains are defined by the ability of devices to receive broadcast messages, and routers are critical in segmenting these domains to control and manage network traffic effectively.
