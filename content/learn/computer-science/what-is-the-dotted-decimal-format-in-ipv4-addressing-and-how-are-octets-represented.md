    What is the dotted decimal format in IPv4 addressing, and how are octets represented?
answer: >-
    In IPv4 addressing, the dotted decimal format is a method of representing a 32-bit IP address as four decimal numbers separated by periods. Each of these decimal numbers corresponds to an octet, which is an 8-bit segment of the 32-bit address. \n\n### Structure of an IPv4 Address\n- **Total Length**: 32 bits\n- **Format**: Dotted decimal representation (e.g., 192.168.10.1)\n- **Components**: \n  - **Octets**: The address is divided into four octets, each consisting of 8 bits.\n  - **Range of Each Octet**: Each octet can represent a decimal value from 0 to 255, as it is derived from the binary representation of 8 bits.\n\n### Example\nFor the IPv4 address `192.168.10.1`:\n- The first octet is `192`, which in binary is `11000000`.\n- The second octet is `168`, which in binary is `10101000`.\n- The third octet is `10`, which in binary is `00001010`.\n- The fourth octet is `1`, which in binary is `00000001`.\n\n### Summary\nThe dotted decimal format simplifies the representation of binary IP addresses, making them easier for humans to read and understand. Each octet's value is derived from its binary equivalent, and the overall structure allows for efficient routing and addressing within networks.
