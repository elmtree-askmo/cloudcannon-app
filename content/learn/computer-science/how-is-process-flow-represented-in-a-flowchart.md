    How is process flow represented in a flowchart?
answer: >-
    Process flow in a flowchart is represented using a combination of standardized symbols and arrows that indicate the sequence of operations and the relationships between different steps in a process. Here are the key components and their roles in representing process flow:\n\n1. **Terminal Symbol (Oval)**: This symbol marks the start and end points of the flowchart. It indicates where the process begins and where it concludes.\n\n2. **Process Symbol (Rectangle)**: This shape represents a specific operation or action being performed, such as calculations, data processing, or any modification of data.\n\n3. **Decision Symbol (Diamond)**: This symbol is used to represent decision points in the process. It typically has two or more outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false) that lead to different paths in the flowchart.\n\n4. **Input/Output Symbol (Parallelogram)**: This shape indicates where data is input into or output from the algorithm, showing the flow of information into and out of the process.\n\n5. **Arrows (Lines)**: Arrows are crucial in flowcharts as they indicate the direction of the process flow. They connect the various symbols, showing how control moves from one step to the next, whether it is to another process, a decision point, or an input/output operation.\n\n6. **Subroutine Symbol**: When a flowchart calls a subroutine, it is represented by a rectangle with double-struck vertical edges. Arrows will show how control flows into and out of that subroutine, linking it back to the main flow of the algorithm.\n\nOverall, the use of these symbols and arrows in flowcharts provides a clear and visual representation of the sequence of steps in an algorithm, making it easier to analyze, design, and communicate complex processes effectively.
