    What are the common operations performed on arrays in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Here are some common operations performed on arrays in Java:\n\n1. **Declaring and Initializing Arrays**: You can declare an array and initialize it with values. For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   ```\n\n2. **Accessing and Modifying Array Elements**: You can access elements using their index, which starts at 0. For example:\n   ```java\n   int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element\n   numbers[1] = 10; // Modifying the second element\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterating Through an Array**: To traverse all elements of an array, you can use a for loop:\n   ```java\n   for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n       System.out.println(numbers[i]);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Sorting an Array**: Java provides a built-in method, `Arrays.sort()`, to sort arrays in ascending order:\n   ```java\n   Arrays.sort(numbers);\n   ```\n\n5. **Searching an Array**: You can search for a specific value using the `Arrays.binarySearch()` method, which requires the array to be sorted:\n   ```java\n   int index = Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 3); // Returns the index of the value 3\n   ```\n\n6. **Filling an Array**: You can fill an array with a specific value using the `Arrays.fill()` method:\n   ```java\n   Arrays.fill(numbers, 0); // Fills the entire array with 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Comparing Arrays**: To check if two arrays are equal, you can use the `Arrays.equals()` method:\n   ```java\n   boolean areEqual = Arrays.equals(array1, array2);\n   ```\n\n8. **Copying Arrays**: You can copy an array using the `Arrays.copyOf()` method:\n   ```java\n   int[] copiedArray = Arrays.copyOf(numbers, numbers.length);\n   ```\n\n9. **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: Java supports multi-dimensional arrays, which can be declared and accessed similarly to single-dimensional arrays. For example:\n   ```java\n   int[][] matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};\n   int value = matrix[1][0]; // Accessing the element at row 1, column 0\n   ```\n\n10. **Advanced Operations**: More advanced operations include merging arrays, inserting and deleting elements, and performing various algorithms for array manipulation.\n\nThese operations are essential for efficient programming in Java, and understanding them will enhance your ability to work with arrays effectively.
