answer: >-
    The ILOVEYOU worm, also known as the Love Bug or Love Letter virus, was a significant piece of malware that emerged on May 5, 2000. It is estimated to have caused around $10 billion in damages globally. The worm infected over 50 million computers within a short span of time, affecting approximately 45 million users in just 10 days. Its rapid spread overwhelmed email servers and disrupted operations across various sectors, including major corporations and government agencies, such as the Pentagon and the British Parliament.\n\nThe financial impact of the ILOVEYOU worm was profound, as it not only involved the costs associated with removing the infection and recovering lost data but also resulted in significant operational disruptions for businesses and organizations worldwide. The incident is often cited as one of the first global computer worm pandemics, highlighting the vulnerabilities in computer systems and the potential for widespread damage caused by malware.
