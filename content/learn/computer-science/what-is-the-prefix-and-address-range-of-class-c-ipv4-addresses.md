    What is the prefix and address range of Class C IPv4 addresses?
answer: >-
    Class C IPv4 addresses are defined within the range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255. The prefix length for Class C addresses is /24, which means that the first 24 bits of the address are used for the network portion, while the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion. \n\nThis structure allows for a maximum of 256 addresses per Class C network (from 192.0.0.0 to 192.0.0.255, for example), but two addresses are reserved: one for the network address (where all host bits are 0) and one for the broadcast address (where all host bits are 1). Therefore, each Class C network can effectively support up to 254 usable host addresses.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Prefix**: /24\n- **Address Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255\n- **Usable Host Addresses**: 254 per network
