    What is Google Quantum AI's current roadmap for building a quantum computer?
answer: >-
    As of early 2023, Google Quantum AI has made significant strides in its roadmap toward building a large-scale quantum computer. A key milestone in this journey is the development of the Willow quantum chip, which represents a major advancement in quantum error correction and computational performance. This chip is designed to reduce errors as it scales up, making it a crucial step toward achieving a commercially viable quantum computer.\n\nThe vision behind Google Quantum AI, founded in 2012, is to harness quantum mechanics to benefit society by advancing scientific discovery and developing applications that address some of the world's greatest challenges. The Willow chip is noted for being the first "below threshold" quantum system, meaning it becomes more accurate as the number of qubits increases, which is a significant breakthrough in the field.\n\nWhile Google has made substantial progress, the company acknowledges that commercial applications for quantum computing are not expected to be available before 2030. The focus remains on refining the technology and overcoming the challenges associated with quantum error correction and scaling.\n\nIn summary, Google Quantum AI's current roadmap emphasizes the development of the Willow chip and aims to achieve a large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer that can operate beyond classical capabilities, with a long-term vision of practical applications in various fields.
