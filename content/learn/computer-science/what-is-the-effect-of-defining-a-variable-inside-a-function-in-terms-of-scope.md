    What is the effect of defining a variable inside a function in terms of scope?
answer: >-
    Defining a variable inside a function in Python has a significant effect on its scope. When a variable is defined within a function, it is considered a **local variable**. This means that the variable is only accessible within the function where it is defined and cannot be accessed from outside that function. \n\nHere are the key points regarding variable scope:\n\n1. **Local Variables**: \n   - A local variable is created when a function is called and is destroyed when the function exits. \n   - It can only be used within the function, and any attempt to access it outside the function will result in a `NameError`.\n\n2. **Global Variables**: \n   - In contrast, a global variable is defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions.\n   - If you want to modify a global variable inside a function, you need to declare it as `global` within that function.\n\nHereâ€™s an example to illustrate the concept:\n\n```python\nglobal_var = 10  # This is a global variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    local_var = 5  # This is a local variable\n    print(global_var)  # Accessible, prints 10\n    print(local_var)   # Accessible, prints 5\n\nmy_function()\nprint(global_var)  # Accessible, prints 10\n# print(local_var)  # Not accessible, would raise a NameError\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `global_var` is accessible both inside and outside `my_function`.\n- `local_var` is only accessible within `my_function`, and trying to print it outside the function would raise an error.\n\nIn summary, defining a variable inside a function limits its scope to that function, making it a local variable, while variables defined outside any function are global and can be accessed throughout the program. This distinction is crucial for managing data and avoiding unintended side effects in larger programs.
