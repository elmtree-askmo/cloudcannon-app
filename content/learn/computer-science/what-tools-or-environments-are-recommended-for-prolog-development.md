    What tools or environments are recommended for Prolog development?
answer: >-
    When developing in Prolog, several tools and environments can enhance your coding experience. Here are some recommended options:\n\n1. **SWI-Prolog**: This is a widely used, free, and open-source Prolog environment that is suitable for both academic and industrial applications. It includes built-in development tools that provide a feature-rich environment for coding, debugging, and testing Prolog programs. Although the built-in tools may appear outdated and have a steep learning curve, they offer real-time semantic highlighting and are built on the portable XPCE graphics system.\n\n2. **Visual Prolog**: This integrated development environment (IDE) includes a built-in editor, debugger, and profiler. It supports various libraries and extensions, making it easier to write efficient and effective Prolog code.\n\n3. **Eclipse Prolog Development Tools (ProDT)**: This is an IDE designed to work with the Eclipse platform, aiming to provide a rich set of functionalities similar to those found in Eclipse's Java IDE. ProDT allows developers to manage Prolog projects from code editing to debugging and testing.\n\n4. **GNU Emacs**: While not exclusively a Prolog IDE, Emacs can be configured with Prolog mode, which provides syntax highlighting and other helpful features for Prolog development.\n\n5. **Text Editors**: Many general-purpose text editors, such as Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text, can be used for Prolog development. With the right definitions file installed, these editors can provide syntax highlighting and other features that enhance the coding experience.\n\nUsing an IDE or a well-configured text editor can significantly improve your efficiency in writing Prolog code, helping you catch errors early and debug more effectively.
