    How are exceptions handled in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, exceptions are handled using a robust mechanism that allows developers to manage runtime errors effectively, ensuring that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. The key components of exception handling in Java include the use of keywords such as `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`.\n\n### Exception Types\nJava categorizes exceptions into two main types:\n1. **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. They must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException` and `SQLException`.\n2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions are not checked at compile-time and include runtime exceptions such as `NullPointerException` and `ArithmeticException`. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException`.\n\n### Basic Syntax\nThe basic syntax for handling exceptions in Java involves the `try-catch` block:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    // Code that may throw an exception\n} catch (ExceptionType e) {\n    // Code to handle the exception\n} finally {\n    // Code that will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred\n}\n```\n\n### Example\nHereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating exception handling in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class ExceptionExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException\n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero: " + e.getMessage());\n        } finally {\n            System.out.println("This block always executes.");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception` to handle errors more effectively.\n2. **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks**: Always handle exceptions meaningfully instead of leaving catch blocks empty.\n3. **Log Exceptions**: Instead of just printing stack traces, log exceptions to provide better insights into issues.\n4. **Use Finally for Cleanup**: Utilize the `finally` block to release resources, ensuring that cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n5. **Propagate Exceptions**: If a method cannot handle an exception, it should declare it using the `throws` keyword to propagate it up the call stack.\n\n### Conclusion\nException handling is a critical aspect of Java programming that helps maintain the stability and reliability of applications. By following best practices and understanding the exception hierarchy, developers can create robust applications that handle errors gracefully.
