    What is the difference between smishing and vishing?
answer: >-
    Smishing and vishing are both forms of phishing attacks that aim to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, but they differ primarily in their method of communication.\n\n**Smishing** is a type of phishing that occurs through SMS (Short Message Service) text messages. In smishing attacks, victims receive deceptive text messages that often contain urgent language or enticing offers, such as winning a prize or needing to verify account information. These messages typically include links to fraudulent websites or requests for personal information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers. The goal is to trick the recipient into providing sensitive data or downloading malware.\n\n**Vishing**, on the other hand, stands for "voice phishing." This method involves fraudulent phone calls or voicemail messages where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks or government agencies. Vishing scams often employ fear tactics or emotional manipulation to convince victims to disclose personal information over the phone. For example, a caller might claim that there is a problem with the victim's bank account and urge them to provide their account details to resolve the issue.\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- **Mode of Communication**: Smishing uses text messages, while vishing uses phone calls.\n- **Tactics**: Smishing often includes links to fraudulent websites, whereas vishing relies on direct conversation and emotional manipulation.\n\nBoth smishing and vishing utilize social engineering tactics to exploit human trust and can lead to identity theft or financial loss if victims are not cautious. To protect against these threats, individuals should avoid clicking on unknown links in text messages and be wary of unsolicited phone calls requesting personal information.
