    What is the primary purpose of spyware?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of spyware is to track and steal sensitive data from users, such as personal information, browsing habits, and financial details. This information is typically sent to another entity, often a cybercriminal or an organization engaged in unethical practices. \n\nSpyware can take various forms, including:\n\n1. **Data Theft**: It is designed to capture sensitive information like credit card numbers, banking details, and passwords. This is often done without the user's consent or knowledge.\n\n2. **Location Tracking**: Certain types of spyware, such as stalkerware, can be used to monitor a person's physical location by discreetly tracking their movements through mobile devices. This type of spyware can also intercept texts and emails, and even eavesdrop on phone calls.\n\n3. **Browser Hijacking**: Some spyware modifies browser settings without the user's knowledge, changing the default search engine or homepage, and adding unwanted toolbars. While the primary goal may be to redirect web traffic or display ads, it can also facilitate the installation of additional spyware.\n\n4. **Monitoring Internet Activity**: Once installed, spyware can monitor a user's internet activity, track login credentials, and spy on sensitive information, further compromising the user's privacy and security.\n\nOverall, spyware poses significant risks to personal privacy and device security, making it a serious concern in the realm of cybersecurity.
