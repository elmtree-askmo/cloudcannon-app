    How are input and output operations represented in a flowchart?
answer: >-
    In flowcharts, input and output operations are represented using **parallelograms**. This standardized symbol indicates where data is received (input) and where results are presented (output) within the algorithm. \n\nFor example, consider a flowchart that describes an algorithm for calculating the sum of two numbers. The flowchart would typically include:\n\n1. **Input Steps**: Parallelograms are used to represent the steps where the two numbers are received from the user.\n2. **Process Steps**: Rectangles are used to show the calculation process (e.g., adding the two numbers).\n3. **Output Step**: Another parallelogram is used to display the result, which is the sum of the two numbers.\n\nFlowcharts utilize a variety of symbols to depict different types of operations, including:\n\n- **Ovals**: Represent the start and end of the process (terminal).\n- **Rectangles**: Indicate processes or operations being performed.\n- **Diamonds**: Represent decision points that lead to different paths based on yes/no or true/false outcomes.\n- **Lines with arrows**: Show the flow of control and data between the various steps.\n\nThis visual representation helps in understanding the sequence of steps in an algorithm and is useful for both designing and communicating algorithms effectively.
