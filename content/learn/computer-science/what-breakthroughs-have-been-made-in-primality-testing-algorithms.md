    What breakthroughs have been made in primality testing algorithms?
answer: >-
    In recent years, significant breakthroughs have been made in the field of primality testing algorithms, particularly with the introduction of the Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) algorithm in 2002. This algorithm marked a pivotal moment in computational number theory as it provided a deterministic polynomial-time method for testing the primality of numbers without relying on unproven assumptions. This was a major theoretical advancement, as prior to this, most efficient algorithms were probabilistic in nature.\n\nDespite the theoretical significance of the AKS algorithm, it has not found widespread practical application in cryptographic contexts. This is primarily because existing probabilistic tests, such as the Elliptic Curve Primality Proving (ECPP) algorithm, tend to outperform AKS in terms of practical running time. The ECPP algorithm, along with other sub-exponential time deterministic tests, remains the preferred choice for applications requiring primality testing.\n\nIn addition to the AKS algorithm, various other algorithms have been developed and refined over the years. These include:\n\n1. **Fermat's Little Theorem**: A probabilistic method that is simple but can yield false positives for certain composite numbers (Carmichael numbers).\n2. **Miller-Rabin Test**: A widely used probabilistic test that is more reliable than Fermat's test and can be configured to reduce the probability of error.\n3. **Solovay-Strassen Test**: Another probabilistic test that is based on properties from number theory and provides a reliable method for primality testing.\n4. **Lucas-Lehmer Test**: Specifically designed for Mersenne primes, this test is efficient for numbers of the form $M_p = 2^p - 1$ where $p$ is prime.\n5. **Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge (Baillie-PWS) Test**: A combination of a strong probabilistic test and a deterministic test that is effective for practical applications.\n\nRecent developments have also focused on optimizing these algorithms for better performance, especially in handling large integers. For instance, researchers have explored the use of advanced number-theoretic techniques and computational optimizations to enhance the efficiency of primality testing.\n\nOverall, while the AKS algorithm represents a significant theoretical advancement, the practical landscape of primality testing continues to be dominated by probabilistic methods that offer faster performance for real-world applications, particularly in cryptography.
