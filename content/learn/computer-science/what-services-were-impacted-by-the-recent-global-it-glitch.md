    What services were impacted by the recent Global IT Glitch?
answer: >-
    The recent Global IT Glitch had a widespread impact on various services and industries around the world. Key sectors affected included:\n\n1. **Airlines**: Major U.S. airlines experienced significant disruptions, with more than half of the U.S.'s 1,352 flight delays and cancellations attributed to the glitch. Flights were grounded, leading to travel chaos and thousands of passengers being stranded at airports.\n\n2. **Healthcare**: Health care providers in the U.S., Canada, and England faced service disruptions. For instance, the Harris Health System in Houston had to suspend hospital visits due to the outage. The National Health Service (NHS) in England reported issues with their appointment and patient record systems, particularly affecting the EMIS Web system used by about 60% of GP practices.\n\n3. **Banking**: Major banks were also impacted, with their operations disrupted, which affected customers' ability to access services.\n\n4. **Media Organizations**: Several media outlets reported being knocked offline, affecting their ability to broadcast news and information.\n\n5. **Emergency Services**: The outage affected emergency communication services, which could have serious implications for public safety.\n\n6. **Retail and Other Businesses**: Various shops and businesses experienced operational challenges due to the IT glitch, highlighting the extensive reliance on technology across different sectors.\n\nThe glitch was attributed to a faulty software update from the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which caused a significant technology outage, described as one of the largest in history. Operations are gradually being restored, but delays and disruptions continued for some time following the initial incident.
