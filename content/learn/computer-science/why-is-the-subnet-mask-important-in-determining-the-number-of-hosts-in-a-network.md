    Why is the subnet mask important in determining the number of hosts in a network?
answer: >-
    The subnet mask is crucial in determining the number of hosts in a network because it defines which portion of an IP address is used for the network and which portion is used for the hosts. This distinction is essential for routing and addressing within a network.\n\n### Understanding Subnet Masks\n\nA subnet mask is a binary pattern that consists of a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. The 1s indicate the network portion of the address, while the 0s indicate the host portion. For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation) means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network, and the remaining 8 bits are used for hosts.\n\n### Calculation of Usable Hosts\n\nThe number of usable hosts in a subnet can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Usable Hosts} = 2^H - 2\n$$\n\nwhere $ H $ is the number of bits allocated for the host portion. The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address (where all host bits are 0) and the broadcast address (where all host bits are 1), which cannot be assigned to individual hosts.\n\nFor example, if you have a subnet mask of /24, there are 8 bits for hosts:\n\n- $ H = 8 $\n- Usable Hosts = $ 2^8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254 $\n\nThis means that in a /24 subnet, you can have 254 usable IP addresses for hosts.\n\n### Importance of Subnet Mask in Network Design\n\n1. **Efficient IP Address Utilization:** By using subnet masks effectively, network administrators can allocate IP addresses more efficiently, ensuring that there are enough addresses for all devices without wasting IP space.\n\n2. **Network Segmentation:** Subnetting allows for the segmentation of networks into smaller, manageable parts, which can improve performance and security.\n\n3. **Scalability:** Understanding how to calculate the number of hosts based on the subnet mask allows for better planning for future growth in network size.\n\nIn summary, the subnet mask is vital for determining the number of hosts in a network by defining the division between the network and host portions of an IP address, enabling efficient address allocation and network management.
