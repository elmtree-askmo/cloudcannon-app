    What are the steps involved in converting a decimal number to binary?
answer: >-
    To convert a decimal number to binary, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the Decimal Number by 2**: Start with the decimal number you want to convert and divide it by 2.\n\n2. **Record the Remainder**: Write down the remainder of the division. This will be either 0 or 1.\n\n3. **Update the Quotient**: Take the quotient (the result of the division) and use it for the next step.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue dividing the new quotient by 2, recording the remainder each time, until the quotient becomes 0.\n\n5. **Read the Remainders in Reverse Order**: The binary representation of the decimal number is obtained by reading the remainders from the last division to the first.\n\n### Example: Converting Decimal 168 to Binary\n\n1. 168 ÷ 2 = 84, remainder 0\n2. 84 ÷ 2 = 42, remainder 0\n3. 42 ÷ 2 = 21, remainder 0\n4. 21 ÷ 2 = 10, remainder 1\n5. 10 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 0\n6. 5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1\n7. 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0\n8. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\nNow, reading the remainders from bottom to top gives you: **10101000**.\n\nThus, the decimal number 168 is represented as **10101000** in binary.
