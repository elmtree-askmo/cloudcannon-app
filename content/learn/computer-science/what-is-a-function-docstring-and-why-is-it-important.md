    What is a function docstring and why is it important?
answer: >-
    A function docstring is a special string that is placed immediately after the function definition in Python. It serves to describe the function's purpose, its parameters, and the return values. The docstring is an essential part of the function as it provides documentation that can be accessed programmatically using the `.__doc__` attribute.\n\nHereâ€™s an example of a function with a docstring:\n\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    """Returns the sum of a and b."""\n    return a + b\n\nprint(add.__doc__)  # Output: Returns the sum of a and b.\n```\n\n### Importance of Function Docstrings\n\n1. **Documentation**: Docstrings provide a clear explanation of what the function does, which is crucial for anyone reading the code. This is especially important in collaborative environments where multiple developers may work on the same codebase.\n\n2. **Improved Readability**: Well-written docstrings enhance the readability of the code. They help other developers (or the original developer at a later time) quickly understand the function's purpose and how to use it without needing to read through the entire implementation.\n\n3. **Ease of Maintenance**: When functions are well-documented, it becomes easier to maintain and update the code. Developers can quickly identify what each function is supposed to do, which reduces the risk of introducing bugs during modifications.\n\n4. **Integration with Help Systems**: Docstrings can be accessed through Python's built-in help system, allowing users to retrieve documentation interactively. This is particularly useful for libraries and frameworks where users may need to understand how to use various functions.\n\n5. **Standardization**: Using docstrings promotes a standard way of documenting functions across a codebase, which can lead to more consistent and professional code.\n\nIn summary, function docstrings are a vital aspect of Python programming that contribute to better documentation, readability, maintainability, and usability of code. They help ensure that functions are not only functional but also understandable and easy to work with.
