    What is the binary representation of a subnet mask and how does it divide the network and host portions?
answer: >-
    The binary representation of a subnet mask is crucial for determining how an IP address is divided into its network and host portions. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is typically represented in dotted decimal format, similar to an IP address. \n\nFor example, a common subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be represented in binary as:\n\n```\n11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n```\n\nIn this binary representation, the '1' bits indicate the network portion of the IP address, while the '0' bits indicate the host portion. The transition from '1' to '0' in the subnet mask defines the boundary between the network and host portions of the IP address.\n\n### Example Breakdown\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n- **IPv4 Address**: 10.20.30.40\n- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)\n\nIn binary, this would be represented as:\n\n- **IPv4 Address**: \n  ```\n  00001010.00010100.00011110.00101000\n  ```\n- **Subnet Mask**: \n  ```\n  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n  ```\n\nIn this case, the first 24 bits (the '1's in the subnet mask) represent the network portion, while the last 8 bits (the '0's) represent the host portion. This means that the network address is 10.20.30.0, and the host addresses can range from 10.20.30.1 to 10.20.30.254.\n\n### Subnet Prefix Notation\n\nThe subnet mask can also be expressed in prefix notation, which indicates the number of '1' bits in the subnet mask. For the example above, the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be represented as /24, indicating that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the binary representation of a subnet mask is a series of '1's followed by '0's, which delineates the network and host portions of an IP address. This division is essential for routing and managing IP addresses within a network.
