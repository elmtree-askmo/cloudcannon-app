    What are the basic operations of a stack and their time complexities?
answer: >-
    A stack is a data structure that operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The basic operations of a stack include:\n\n1. **Push**: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) - This is a constant time operation because it involves placing the new element at the top of the stack, which does not depend on the number of elements already in the stack.\n\n2. **Pop**: This operation removes the top element from the stack and returns it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Similar to the push operation, popping an element involves removing the top element, which is also a constant time operation.\n\n3. **Peek** (or Top): This operation retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) - This operation is constant time as it simply accesses the top element without modifying the stack.\n\nIn terms of space complexity, the stack requires O(n) space, where n is the number of elements in the stack, as it needs to store all the elements added to it.\n\nOverall, the stack's operations are efficient, making it a useful data structure in various applications, such as function call management in programming languages, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
