    How many bits are there in an IPv4 address, and what is the decimal range of each octet?
answer: >-
    An IPv4 address consists of **32 bits** in total. This 32-bit address is divided into **four octets**, with each octet containing **8 bits**. \n\nThe decimal range of each octet is from **0 to 255**. This is because an 8-bit binary number can represent values from $2^0$ (which is 1) to $2^8 - 1$ (which is 255), allowing for a total of 256 possible values (including 0).\n\nTo summarize:\n- Total bits in an IPv4 address: **32 bits**\n- Number of octets: **4**\n- Bits in each octet: **8 bits**\n- Decimal range of each octet: **0 to 255**
