    How can you access a function's docstring in Python?
answer: >-
    In Python, you can access a function's docstring using the `.__doc__` attribute. The docstring is a special string that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return values, and it is placed immediately after the function definition.\n\nHereâ€™s an example to illustrate how to access a function's docstring:\n\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    """Returns the sum of a and b."""\n    return a + b\n\n# Accessing the docstring\nprint(add.__doc__)  # Output: Returns the sum of a and b.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add` function has a docstring that explains what the function does. By using `add.__doc__`, you can retrieve and print this documentation string. This feature is particularly useful for understanding the functionality of functions, especially when working with larger codebases or libraries.
