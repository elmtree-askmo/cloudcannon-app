    In IPv4 addressing, a broadcast address is used to send packets to all hosts within a specific subnet. The representation of a broadcast address occurs when all bits in the host portion of the address are set to 1s. This is a crucial concept in networking, particularly for directed broadcasts.\n\n### Representation of a Broadcast Address\n\n1. **Structure of an IPv4 Address**: An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number divided into four octets. Each octet is represented in decimal format, separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).\n\n2. **Subnet Mask**: The subnet mask defines which part of the IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion. It is also a 32-bit number, typically represented in decimal format (e.g., 255.255.255.0) or in CIDR notation (e.g., /24).\n\n3. **Broadcast Address Calculation**:\n   - The broadcast address is derived from the network address by setting all bits in the host portion to 1.\n   - For example, if we have a network address of 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24), the binary representation would be:\n     - **Network Address**: 192.168.1.0 → `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000`\n     - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0 → `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`\n   - The host portion consists of the last 8 bits (since the subnet mask has 24 bits set to 1). To find the broadcast address, we set these 8 bits to 1:\n     - **Broadcast Address**: `11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111` → 192.168.1.255\n\n4. **General Rule**: The broadcast address for any subnet can be calculated by taking the network address and adding the maximum value for the host portion, which is represented by all bits being 1. This means that for a subnet with a subnet mask of /n, the broadcast address will have the first n bits as the same as the network address, and the remaining (32-n) bits will be all 1s.\n\n### Example of Broadcast Address\n- **Subnet**: 172.16.4.0/24\n- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0\n- **Broadcast Address**: 172.16.4.255 (where the last octet is all 1s)\n\nIn summary, the representation of a broadcast address occurs when the host portion of an IPv4 address is filled with 1s, allowing communication to all devices within the specified subnet. This is essential for various network operations, including announcements and discovery processes.
