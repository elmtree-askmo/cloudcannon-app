    Technical obsolescence in electronic products refers to the phenomenon where a product becomes outdated due to advancements in technology, even if the product is still functional. Here are some examples of technical obsolescence in electronic products:\n\n1. **Smartphones**: As new models are released with advanced features, older smartphones may not support the latest software updates or applications. For instance, a smartphone that cannot run the latest operating system or apps becomes less desirable, leading consumers to upgrade to newer models.\n\n2. **Computers**: Similar to smartphones, computers can become obsolete when they cannot support new software or hardware upgrades. For example, a computer that cannot run the latest version of an operating system or lacks the processing power for modern applications may prompt users to purchase a new device.\n\n3. **Televisions**: The transition from analog to digital broadcasting rendered many older televisions obsolete. Additionally, the rise of smart TVs with internet connectivity and streaming capabilities has made older models less appealing.\n\n4. **Home Appliances**: Appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, and microwaves may become technically obsolete when newer models offer energy efficiency, smart technology integration, or advanced features that older models lack.\n\n5. **Gaming Consoles**: As new gaming consoles are released, older models may no longer receive software updates or new game releases, leading gamers to upgrade to the latest hardware.\n\n6. **Software Applications**: Software can also experience technical obsolescence when it is no longer supported by the developer. For example, an application that does not receive updates may become incompatible with newer operating systems or hardware.\n\n7. **Electronic Components**: In industries such as aerospace and automotive, electronic components can become obsolete when manufacturers discontinue production of specific parts, necessitating costly redesigns or replacements.\n\nThese examples illustrate how technical obsolescence can drive consumer behavior and contribute to the growing issue of electronic waste (e-waste), as functional products are discarded in favor of newer technologies.
