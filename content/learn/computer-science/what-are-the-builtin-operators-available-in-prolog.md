    What are the built-in operators available in Prolog?
answer: >-
    In Prolog, built-in operators are essential for performing various operations, including arithmetic calculations, comparisons, and logical operations. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different types of built-in operators available in Prolog:\n\n### 1. Arithmetic Operators\nArithmetic operators in Prolog are used to perform mathematical calculations. They are defined as ordinary Prolog functors. Some common arithmetic operators include:\n- **Addition**: `X + Y` (or `+/2`)\n- **Subtraction**: `X - Y` (or `-/2`)\n- **Multiplication**: `X * Y` (or `*/2`)\n- **Division**: `X / Y` (or `//2`)\n- **Integer Division**: `X // Y`\n- **Modulus**: `X mod Y`\n- **Unary Negation**: `-X` (or `-/1`)\n\n### 2. Comparison Operators\nComparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result. The common comparison operators include:\n- **Equal**: `X =:= Y`\n- **Not Equal**: `X =\= Y`\n- **Greater Than**: `X > Y`\n- **Less Than**: `X < Y`\n- **Greater Than or Equal**: `X >= Y`\n- **Less Than or Equal**: `X =< Y`\n\n### 3. Logical Operators\nLogical operators are used to perform logical operations. They include:\n- **Conjunction**: `A, B` (logical AND)\n- **Disjunction**: `A; B` (logical OR)\n- **Negation**: `\+ A` (logical NOT)\n\n### 4. Custom Operators\nProlog allows users to define their own operators using the built-in `op/3` predicate. This can enhance code readability and allow for custom syntax. For example, you can define a custom operator for a specific operation, making it easier to express complex expressions.\n\n### 5. Operator Precedence and Associativity\nOperators in Prolog have defined precedence levels, which determine the order in which operations are performed. For instance, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.\n\n### 6. Infix Notation\nMany built-in predicates in Prolog are defined as infix operators, allowing them to be used in a more natural mathematical notation. For example, instead of writing `plus(2, 3)`, you can simply write `2 + 3`.\n\n### Conclusion\nProlog's built-in operators facilitate numerical manipulation, logical reasoning, and comparison operations, making it a powerful tool for programming in logic. Understanding these operators is crucial for writing effective Prolog programs and leveraging its capabilities for various applications, such as mathematical computations and data comparisons.
