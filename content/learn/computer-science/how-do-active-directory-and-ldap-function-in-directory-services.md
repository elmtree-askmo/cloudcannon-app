    How do Active Directory and LDAP function in directory services?
answer: >-
    Active Directory (AD) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) are integral components of directory services, but they serve different roles and functions.\n\n**Active Directory** is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides a centralized database for managing users, devices, and services within a Windows environment. It is primarily used for identity and access management (IAM), allowing administrators to manage permissions and access rights for users and resources across the network. Active Directory organizes this information in a hierarchical structure, which makes it easier to manage and retrieve.\n\n**LDAP**, on the other hand, is a standard application protocol used to access and manage directory services. It provides a way for clients to communicate with directory servers, including Active Directory. LDAP is vendor-neutral and can be used with various directory services, not just Microsoftâ€™s. It allows for querying and modifying directory entries, making it a versatile tool for interacting with directory services.\n\nThe relationship between Active Directory and LDAP is that Active Directory supports LDAP as one of its communication protocols. This means that LDAP clients can connect to Active Directory servers using the LDAP protocol, enabling them to perform operations such as authentication, querying user information, and modifying directory entries. \n\nIn summary, while Active Directory is a proprietary directory service that provides a comprehensive suite of identity management features, LDAP is a protocol that facilitates access to directory services, including Active Directory. This collaboration allows organizations to leverage the strengths of both systems for effective directory management and security.
