    Attributed grammars differ from traditional grammars in that they are used to define the semantics of programming languages by associating attributes with grammar rules, allowing for dynamic and context-sensitive evaluations, while traditional grammars set prescriptive language norms.

    How do attributed grammars differ from traditional grammars?
answer: >-
    Attributed grammars differ from traditional grammars primarily in their purpose and structure. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Traditional Grammars**: These are prescriptive frameworks that focus on establishing rules and norms for "correct" language usage. They emphasize syntax, morphology, and phonology, aiming to prescribe how language should be used rather than describing how it is actually used in practice.\n   - **Attributed Grammars**: These are formal specifications used primarily in computer science and programming language design. They extend context-free grammars by associating semantic attributes with the grammar's production rules. This allows for the definition of the semantics (meaning) of constructs in a programming language, enabling the evaluation of these attributes during parsing.\n\n2. **Structure**:\n   - **Traditional Grammars**: They categorize words into parts of speech and provide guidelines for sentence structure based on prescriptive rules. The analysis is often focused on the correctness of language use according to established norms.\n   - **Attributed Grammars**: They augment each production rule with a set of attributes that can be synthesized or inherited. For example, in an abstract syntax tree (AST), attributes can be passed from a node to its parent (synthesized attributes) or from a parent to its children (inherited attributes). This allows for a more dynamic and context-sensitive interpretation of language constructs.\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\n   - **Traditional Grammars**: The evaluation of language is static, focusing on whether sentences conform to established grammatical rules.\n   - **Attributed Grammars**: They allow for the evaluation of attributes in a more flexible manner, often enabling computations to be performed as the parse tree is constructed. For instance, L-attributed grammars allow attributes to be evaluated in a single left-to-right traversal of the AST, which is particularly useful in top-down parsing.\n\nIn summary, while traditional grammars focus on prescriptive rules for language use, attributed grammars provide a more dynamic framework for defining and evaluating the semantics of programming languages through the use of attributes associated with grammar rules.
