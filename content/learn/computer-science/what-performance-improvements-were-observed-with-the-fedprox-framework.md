    What performance improvements were observed with the FedProx framework?
answer: >-
    The FedProx framework has demonstrated significant performance improvements over the traditional FedAvg method, particularly in the context of heterogeneous federated learning environments. Here are the key performance enhancements observed with FedProx:\n\n1. **Robustness and Stability**: FedProx has been shown to improve the robustness and stability of convergence in federated networks. This is particularly important in scenarios where devices may have varying computational capabilities and data distributions.\n\n2. **Convergence Behavior**: The framework allows for variable amounts of local work to be performed across devices, which helps stabilize convergence in the presence of both statistical and systems heterogeneity. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining performance in diverse network conditions.\n\n3. **Accuracy Improvements**: Empirical evaluations indicate that FedProx can achieve an average absolute test accuracy improvement of approximately 22% compared to FedAvg. In highly heterogeneous settings, the improvement in test accuracy can be as high as 18.8% on average.\n\n4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: FedProx provides convergence guarantees that account for both statistical and systems heterogeneity, enhancing the theoretical foundation of federated learning methods.\n\n5. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive empirical evaluations across a suite of synthetic and real-world federated datasets have validated the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that FedProx consistently outperforms FedAvg in terms of convergence stability and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the FedProx framework not only addresses the challenges posed by heterogeneity in federated learning but also enhances the overall performance and reliability of the learning process across diverse devices and data distributions.
