    How do you declare and initialize a double array in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, declaring and initializing a double array can be done in several ways. Here are the common methods:\n\n1. **Declaration and Initialization with Default Values**:\n   You can declare a double array and initialize it with a specific size, which will automatically fill the array with default values (0.0 for double).\n   ```java\n   double[] arr = new double[5]; // This creates an array of size 5, initialized with 0.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Declaration and Initialization with Specific Values**:\n   You can also declare and initialize a double array with specific values at the same time.\n   ```java\n   double[] initializedArray = {1.5, 2.7, 3.2, 4.8, 5.1}; // This creates an array with specified values\n   ```\n\n3. **Separate Declaration and Initialization**:\n   You can declare a double array first and then initialize it later.\n   ```java\n   double[] doubleArray; // Declaration\n   doubleArray = new double[5]; // Initialization with default values\n   ```\n\n4. **Two-Dimensional Double Array**:\n   If you need a two-dimensional array, you can declare and initialize it as follows:\n   ```java\n   double[][] twoDimensionalArray = new double[5][3]; // Creates a 5x3 two-dimensional array\n   ```\n\nIn summary, you can declare a double array in Java by specifying the data type followed by square brackets and the array name. You can then initialize it either with default values or with specific values, depending on your needs.
