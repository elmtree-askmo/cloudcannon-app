    What is a transition table and what purpose does it serve in Automata Theory?
answer: >-
    A transition table is a crucial component in automata theory, serving as a tabular representation of the transition function of a finite-state machine (FSM). It outlines how the machine transitions from one state to another based on the current state and the input symbol it reads.\n\n### Structure of a Transition Table\nThe transition table typically consists of rows and columns:\n- **Rows** represent the current states of the automaton.\n- **Columns** represent the input symbols that the automaton can read.\n- Each cell in the table indicates the next state the automaton will transition to when it is in a specific current state and reads a particular input symbol.\n\nFor example, a simplified transition table might look like this:\n\n| Current State | Input | Next State |\n|---------------|-------|------------|\n| S0            | 0     | S1         |\n| S0            | 1     | S2         |\n| S1            | 0     | S0         |\n| S1            | 1     | S2         |\n| S2            | 0     | S1         |\n| S2            | 1     | S0         |\n\n### Purpose of a Transition Table\n1. **Clarity**: It provides a clear and concise way to visualize the behavior of the automaton, making it easier to understand how the machine operates.\n2. **Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic**: In a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), each state has exactly one transition for each input symbol. In contrast, a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) can have multiple transitions for a single state/input pair, or even none at all. The transition table helps to illustrate these differences.\n3. **Formal Specification**: It serves as a formal specification of the automaton's behavior, which is essential for both theoretical analysis and practical implementation.\n4. **Problem Solving**: Transition tables are used in problem-solving scenarios within automata theory, such as determining whether a given input string is accepted by the automaton.\n\nIn summary, transition tables are fundamental tools in automata theory that facilitate the understanding and analysis of finite-state machines by clearly mapping out state transitions based on input symbols.
