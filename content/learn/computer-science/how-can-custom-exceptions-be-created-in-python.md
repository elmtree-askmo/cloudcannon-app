    How can custom exceptions be created in Python?
answer: >-
    Creating custom exceptions in Python is a straightforward process that involves subclassing the built-in `Exception` class. This allows you to define specific error types that can be raised and caught in your programs, making your error handling more precise and informative.\n\n### Steps to Create Custom Exceptions\n\n1. **Define a Custom Exception Class**: You start by creating a new class that inherits from the `Exception` class. This class can include additional attributes or methods to provide more context about the error.\n\n   Here’s a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   class MyCustomError(Exception):\n       """Custom exception for a specific error."""\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Custom Attributes (Optional)**: You can enhance your custom exception by adding attributes that provide more information about the error. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   class InvalidAgeException(Exception):\n       """Raised when the input value is less than 18."""\n       def __init__(self, age):\n           self.age = age\n           super().__init__(f"Invalid age: {age}. Age must be at least 18.")\n   ```\n\n3. **Raise the Custom Exception**: You can raise your custom exception in your code using the `raise` statement. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   def check_age(age):\n       if age < 18:\n           raise InvalidAgeException(age)\n       return "Age is valid."\n   ```\n\n4. **Catch the Custom Exception**: You can catch your custom exception using a `try...except` block, allowing you to handle the error gracefully.\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       print(check_age(15))\n   except InvalidAgeException as e:\n       print(e)\n   ```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Organize Custom Exceptions**: If you have multiple custom exceptions, consider organizing them in a separate file (e.g., `exceptions.py`) to maintain clarity and ease of use.\n- **Inherit from Appropriate Built-in Exceptions**: While you can inherit from `Exception`, it’s often better to inherit from a more specific built-in exception class that fits your use case (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).\n- **Keep It Simple**: Custom exceptions should be simple and focused on a specific error condition. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Example in Context\n\nFor an e-commerce inventory system, you might define a custom exception for handling out-of-stock scenarios:\n\n```python\nclass OutOfStockError(Exception):\n    """Raised when an item is out of stock."""\n    def __init__(self, item):\n        self.item = item\n        super().__init__(f"The item '{item}' is out of stock.")\n```\n\nYou can then use this exception in your inventory management logic:\n\n```python\ndef purchase_item(item, quantity):\n    if quantity > available_stock[item]:\n        raise OutOfStockError(item)\n    # Proceed with purchase logic\n```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create effective custom exceptions that enhance the robustness and clarity of your Python applications.
