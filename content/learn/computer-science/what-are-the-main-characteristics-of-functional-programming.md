    What are the main characteristics of functional programming?

    Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions to construct software. Here are the main characteristics of functional programming:\n\n1. **Pure Functions**: A core principle of functional programming is the use of pure functions. These functions have two main characteristics:\n   - They always produce the same output for the same input, regardless of any external factors.\n   - They do not have side effects, meaning they do not modify any external state, such as global variables or input/output streams.\n\n2. **Immutability**: In functional programming, data is immutable. Once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, new data structures are created. This approach helps maintain a consistent state throughout the execution of a program and reduces the likelihood of bugs related to state changes.\n\n3. **First-Class Functions**: Functions in functional programming are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. This allows for higher-order functions, which can operate on other functions.\n\n4. **Referential Transparency**: An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior. This property is closely related to pure functions and contributes to easier reasoning about code.\n\n5. **Function Composition**: Functional programming encourages the composition of functions to build more complex operations. By combining simple functions, developers can create more sophisticated behavior while maintaining modularity and clarity in their code.\n\n6. **Declarative Style**: Functional programming focuses on "what" to solve rather than "how" to solve it. This declarative approach contrasts with imperative programming, where the emphasis is on the sequence of operations to achieve a result.\n\n7. **List-Centric Execution and Recursion**: Functional programming often relies on lists and recursion as primary data structures and control flow mechanisms. Recursive functions are used to process lists and other data structures, which can lead to elegant solutions for problems that involve iteration.\n\n8. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This feature allows for powerful abstractions and code reuse.\n\n9. **Laziness**: Some functional programming languages support lazy evaluation, where expressions are not evaluated until their values are needed. This can lead to performance improvements and the ability to work with infinite data structures.\n\nOverall, functional programming promotes a style of coding that is modular, maintainable, and easier to reason about, making it a popular choice for many developers, especially in domains that require high reliability and maintainability.
