answer: >-
    The primary purpose of the debug command in network troubleshooting is to allow network administrators to view real-time information about the operation of a device and its protocols. This command provides detailed insights into the processes, events, and mechanisms occurring within the network device, which can be invaluable for diagnosing specific issues.\n\nHowever, it is important to use the debug command with caution. The output generated can be extensive and may consume significant system resources, potentially impacting the device's performance. In some cases, excessive debugging can overwhelm the router, making it unable to perform its network functions effectively or even respond to commands to disable debugging.\n\nIn summary, while the debug command is a powerful tool for troubleshooting, it should be employed judiciously to avoid adverse effects on network performance.
