    What are some practical examples of using dictionaries in Python?
answer: >-
    Python dictionaries are versatile data structures that allow you to store and retrieve data in a key-value format. Here are some practical examples of using dictionaries in Python:\n\n1. **Storing Product Prices**:\n   You can use a dictionary to associate product names with their prices in a supermarket. This allows for quick lookups of prices based on product names.\n\n   ```python\n   product_prices = {\n       'apple': 0.50,\n       'banana': 0.30,\n       'orange': 0.80\n   }\n   print(product_prices['banana'])  # Output: 0.30\n   ```\n\n2. **Student Grades**:\n   A dictionary can be used to map student names to their grades, making it easy to retrieve a student's grade by their name.\n\n   ```python\n   student_grades = {\n       'Alice': 'A',\n       'Bob': 'B',\n       'Charlie': 'C'\n   }\n   print(student_grades['Alice'])  # Output: A\n   ```\n\n3. **Customer Information**:\n   In a business context, you can use dictionaries to store customer information, such as customer IDs associated with names and contact details.\n\n   ```python\n   customers = {\n       'C001': {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'},\n       'C002': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'email': 'jane@example.com'}\n   }\n   print(customers['C001']['name'])  # Output: John Doe\n   ```\n\n4. **Counting Occurrences**:\n   You can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of items in a list, which is useful for data analysis.\n\n   ```python\n   items = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana']\n   count = {}\n   for item in items:\n       count[item] = count.get(item, 0) + 1\n   print(count)  # Output: {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 1}\n   ```\n\n5. **Configuration Settings**:\n   Dictionaries can be used to store configuration settings for an application, allowing for easy access and modification.\n\n   ```python\n   config = {\n       'host': 'localhost',\n       'port': 8080,\n       'debug': True\n   }\n   print(config['host'])  # Output: localhost\n   ```\n\n6. **Using the `get()` Method**:\n   The `get()` method allows you to retrieve values safely, providing a default value if the key does not exist.\n\n   ```python\n   my_dict = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30}\n   print(my_dict.get('age', 'Not Found'))  # Output: 30\n   print(my_dict.get('address', 'Not Found'))  # Output: Not Found\n   ```\n\n7. **Nested Dictionaries**:\n   You can create nested dictionaries to represent more complex data structures, such as a collection of books with authors and publication years.\n\n   ```python\n   books = {\n       '978-3-16-148410-0': {'title': 'Python Programming', 'author': 'John Smith', 'year': 2020},\n       '978-1-23-456789-7': {'title': 'Data Science', 'author': 'Jane Doe', 'year': 2021}\n   }\n   print(books['978-3-16-148410-0']['author'])  # Output: John Smith\n   ```\n\nThese examples illustrate the flexibility and utility of dictionaries in Python for various applications, from simple data storage to more complex data structures.
