    Provide an example of pseudocode for insertion sort.
answer: >-
    Here is an example of pseudocode for the insertion sort algorithm, which sorts an array in ascending order:\n\n```plaintext\nInsertionSort(array A)\n    for i from 1 to length(A) - 1 do\n        key = A[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        \n        // Move elements of A[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        // to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and A[j] > key do\n            A[j + 1] = A[j]\n            j = j - 1\n        \n        A[j + 1] = key\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The algorithm iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n2. For each element (referred to as `key`), it compares it with the elements in the sorted portion of the array (to its left).\n3. If the `key` is smaller than the compared element, the compared element is shifted one position to the right.\n4. This process continues until the correct position for the `key` is found, at which point the `key` is inserted into that position.\n5. The process repeats until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThis pseudocode effectively captures the essence of the insertion sort algorithm, which is particularly efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
