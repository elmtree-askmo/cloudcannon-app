    What is a Finite State Machine and how does it function?
answer: >-
    A Finite State Machine (FSM), also known as a finite-state automaton (FSA), is a mathematical model of computation that represents a system with a finite number of states. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of these states at any given time. The FSM transitions from one state to another in response to specific inputs, and these transitions are defined by a set of rules.\n\n### Key Components of a Finite State Machine:\n1. **States**: The finite number of conditions or situations in which the FSM can exist.\n2. **Initial State**: The state in which the FSM starts its operation.\n3. **Transitions**: The rules that dictate how the FSM moves from one state to another based on input.\n4. **Input Symbols**: The external signals or data that trigger transitions between states.\n5. **Final States**: One or more states that signify the completion of a process or acceptance of input.\n\n### Functionality:\nThe FSM operates by reading input symbols and transitioning between states according to its transition rules. For example, consider a simple FSM that represents a traffic light controller. The states could be "Red," "Green," and "Yellow," and the transitions would be based on a timer or sensor inputs that dictate when to change from one light to another.\n\n### Types of Finite State Machines:\n1. **Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFSM)**: In a DFSM, for each state and input symbol, there is exactly one transition to a new state. This means the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and input.\n2. **Non-deterministic Finite State Machine (NFSM)**: In an NFSM, there can be multiple possible transitions for a given state and input symbol, allowing for more flexibility in state transitions.\n\n### Applications:\nFinite State Machines are widely used in various applications, including:\n- **Communication Protocols**: Managing the states of data transmission and ensuring proper communication between devices.\n- **Control Systems**: Such as traffic light controllers, vending machines, and game AI (e.g., Pac-Man).\n- **Software Design Patterns**: Implementing state-based behavior in software applications.\n\nIn summary, a Finite State Machine is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the behavior of systems that can be in a limited number of states, making it essential in both theoretical computer science and practical applications.
