    What experiments were conducted to assess statistical heterogeneity in FedProx?
answer: >-
    To assess statistical heterogeneity in the FedProx framework, a series of experiments were conducted that focused on the convergence behavior of FedProx under varying levels of statistical heterogeneity. The researchers introduced a device dissimilarity assumption, which allowed them to derive the first convergence guarantees for FedProx in practical federated settings characterized by heterogeneous data.\n\nThe empirical evaluation involved testing FedProx against the baseline methods, including Federated Average (FedAvg) and other federated learning approaches like Federated Curvature (FedCurv) and Federated Newton Learn. The results demonstrated that FedProx exhibited significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior compared to FedAvg, particularly in highly heterogeneous environments. Specifically, it was noted that FedProx improved absolute test accuracy by an average of 18.8%.\n\nThe experiments were conducted across a suite of synthetic and real-world federated datasets, which helped illustrate the robustness and stability of FedProx in the presence of statistical heterogeneity. The findings validated the theoretical analysis of the framework, confirming that the proximal term in FedProx contributes to improved convergence by accommodating variable amounts of local work performed across devices.\n\nOverall, the experiments highlighted the effectiveness of FedProx in addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity in federated learning, showcasing its potential for enhancing the performance of machine learning models in distributed environments.
