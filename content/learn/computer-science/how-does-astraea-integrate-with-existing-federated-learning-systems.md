answer: >-
    Astraea is a self-balancing federated learning framework designed to enhance classification accuracy in mobile deep learning applications, particularly in scenarios where data is imbalanced across different clients. It integrates with existing federated learning systems by employing two primary strategies to address the challenges posed by imbalanced data distribution:\n\n1. **Global Data Distribution-Based Data Augmentation**: Astraea utilizes data augmentation techniques that are informed by the global distribution of data across all participating clients. This approach helps to generate synthetic data that can balance the representation of different classes, thereby mitigating the bias that often arises from uneven data distribution.\n\n2. **Mediator-Based Multi-Client Rescheduling**: This strategy involves a mediator that coordinates the rescheduling of clients based on their data distribution. By dynamically adjusting which clients participate in the training process and when, Astraea ensures that the training process is more representative of the overall data distribution, further alleviating the effects of imbalanced data.\n\nAstraea is implemented using the TensorFlow Federated Framework, which allows it to seamlessly integrate with existing federated learning systems. The framework has been shown to improve classification accuracy significantly compared to traditional methods, such as FedAvg, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced data. For instance, experimental results indicate that Astraea can achieve a top-1 accuracy improvement of +5.59% over FedAvg in imbalanced settings.\n\nIn summary, Astraea enhances existing federated learning systems by providing a structured approach to data augmentation and client scheduling, effectively addressing the challenges of imbalanced data and improving overall model performance.
