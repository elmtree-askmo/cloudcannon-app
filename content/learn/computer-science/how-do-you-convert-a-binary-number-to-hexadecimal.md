    To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, you can follow a straightforward process that takes advantage of the direct relationship between the two number systems. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a group of four binary digits (bits). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to perform the conversion:\n\n### Steps to Convert Binary to Hexadecimal\n\n1. **Group the Binary Digits**: \n   - Start from the rightmost side of the binary number and group the digits into sets of four. If the leftmost group has fewer than four digits, you can pad it with zeros on the left.\n   - For example, if you have the binary number `110101011011`, you would group it as follows:\n     ```\n     1101 0101 1011\n     ```\n\n2. **Convert Each Group to Hexadecimal**: \n   - Use a binary to hexadecimal conversion table to find the hexadecimal equivalent of each group of four binary digits:\n     - `0000` = 0\n     - `0001` = 1\n     - `0010` = 2\n     - `0011` = 3\n     - `0100` = 4\n     - `0101` = 5\n     - `0110` = 6\n     - `0111` = 7\n     - `1000` = 8\n     - `1001` = 9\n     - `1010` = A\n     - `1011` = B\n     - `1100` = C\n     - `1101` = D\n     - `1110` = E\n     - `1111` = F\n\n   - For the example `110101011011`, the groups convert as follows:\n     - `1101` = D\n     - `0101` = 5\n     - `1011` = B\n\n3. **Combine the Hexadecimal Digits**: \n   - Combine the hexadecimal digits obtained from each group to form the final hexadecimal number. For our example, the binary number `110101011011` converts to `D5B` in hexadecimal.\n\n### Summary\nThe binary number `110101011011` is equivalent to `D5B` in hexadecimal. This method is efficient due to the direct correspondence between binary and hexadecimal, making conversions straightforward.
