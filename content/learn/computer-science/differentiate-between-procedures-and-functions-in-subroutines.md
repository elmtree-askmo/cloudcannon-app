    Differentiate between procedures and functions in subroutines.
answer: >-
    In programming, procedures and functions are both types of subroutines that help organize code and promote reusability. However, they have distinct characteristics and serve different purposes. Here’s a detailed differentiation between the two:\n\n### 1. Return Value\n- **Procedure**: A procedure is a block of code that performs a specific task but does not return a value. It is primarily used for executing a sequence of statements, such as modifying data or printing output.\n- **Function**: A function is designed to perform a task and return a value. This return value can be used in expressions or assigned to variables, making functions integral to calculations and data processing.\n\n### 2. Purpose\n- **Procedure**: Procedures are often used for performing actions that do not require a return value. For example, they might be used to update a database, print a report, or perform a series of operations without needing to provide feedback to the caller.\n- **Function**: Functions are used to compute values and can be part of expressions. They encapsulate logic that can be reused throughout the program, such as mathematical calculations or data transformations.\n\n### 3. Invocation\n- **Procedure**: Procedures can be called from other procedures or functions and can be invoked at any point during the program's execution. They are typically used when the outcome of the operation does not need to be captured.\n- **Function**: Functions can also be called from other functions or procedures, but they are typically invoked in contexts where their return value is needed. For instance, a function might be called to calculate a value that will be used in a conditional statement or assigned to a variable.\n\n### 4. Modularity\nBoth procedures and functions contribute to modularity in programming. By breaking down a program into smaller, manageable sections, developers can focus on individual components, making the code easier to understand and maintain. This modular approach helps in organizing complex programs and enhances code readability.\n\n### Example\nHere’s a simple example to illustrate the difference:\n\n**Procedure Example**:\n```python\ndef print_greeting(name):\n    print(f"Hello, {name}!")\n```\nIn this example, `print_greeting` is a procedure that performs the action of printing a greeting but does not return any value.\n\n**Function Example**:\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    return length * width\n```\nIn this example, `calculate_area` is a function that computes the area of a rectangle and returns the result, which can be used in further calculations or expressions.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the primary difference between procedures and functions lies in their return values and purposes. Procedures perform tasks without returning values, while functions are designed to compute and return values. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective programming and code organization.
