    What is the primary purpose of a Link-Local Address (LLA) in IPv6?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of a Link-Local Address (LLA) in IPv6 is to facilitate communication between devices on the same local link (or subnet). LLAs are specifically designed for local network operations and are not routable beyond the local link. This means that packets with a source or destination LLA cannot be forwarded by routers to other networks.\n\nKey characteristics of Link-Local Addresses include:\n\n1. **Automatic Generation**: LLAs are automatically generated by devices when IPv6 is enabled. If a device does not have a manually configured LLA, it will create one automatically.\n\n2. **Address Range**: LLAs fall within the `fe80::/10` range. This specific range is reserved for link-local communication.\n\n3. **Mandatory Presence**: Every IPv6-enabled interface must have an LLA. This ensures that devices can communicate with each other on the same local link without requiring a globally routable address.\n\n4. **Local Network Operations**: LLAs are used for essential functions such as neighbor discovery, which allows devices to identify and communicate with other devices on the same local network.\n\nIn summary, LLAs are crucial for enabling local communication and network operations within a subnet, ensuring that devices can interact without the need for external routing.
