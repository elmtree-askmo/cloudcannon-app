    What role did the government play in addressing the Global IT Glitch?
answer: >-
    The government played a significant role in addressing the Global IT Glitch that occurred due to a cybersecurity issue linked to a software update from CrowdStrike. This glitch resulted in a widespread technology outage that affected various sectors, including airports, hospitals, banks, and government agencies.\n\nIn response to the incident, government agencies, particularly in the United States, were quick to assess the situation and implement recovery measures. For instance, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, declared an emergency as local government services were disrupted. The Social Security Administration was notably impacted, leading to the closure of all its offices due to the outage.\n\nCrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm responsible for the software update, identified the issue and deployed a fix to mitigate the effects of the glitch. This response was crucial in restoring normal operations across affected sectors. The incident highlighted the vulnerabilities in reliance on software from a limited number of providers and underscored the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.\n\nOverall, the government's involvement included emergency declarations, coordination with cybersecurity firms for rapid fixes, and efforts to ensure the continuity of essential services during the outage. This incident serves as a reminder of the critical need for effective technology management and disaster recovery planning within government operations.
