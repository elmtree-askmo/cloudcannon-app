    How do binary search trees differ from other tree structures?
answer: >-
    Binary search trees (BSTs) differ from other tree structures primarily in their organization and the properties that govern their node arrangement. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Node Arrangement**: In a binary search tree, each node has a comparable value, and the arrangement follows specific rules:\n   - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.\n   - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\n   This ordered structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: The efficiency of operations in a BST is significantly better than in a general binary tree. In a balanced BST, operations such as search, insert, and delete can be performed in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In contrast, a regular binary tree does not guarantee this efficiency, as it can become unbalanced, leading to operations taking $O(n)$ time in the worst case.\n\n3. **Types of Trees**: While all binary search trees are binary trees, not all binary trees are binary search trees. A binary tree can have nodes with zero, one, or two children and does not enforce any ordering of values. This flexibility can lead to inefficiencies as the tree grows larger without a specific structure.\n\n4. **Use Cases**: Binary search trees are particularly useful when there is a need for dynamic data storage that requires frequent searching, insertion, and deletion. They combine the benefits of arrays (sorted order) and linked lists (dynamic size), making them suitable for various applications in computer science.\n\n5. **Balance**: The balance of a binary search tree is crucial for maintaining its efficiency. An unbalanced BST can degrade to a linked list in the worst case, which would negate the logarithmic time complexity for operations. Techniques such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees are often employed to maintain balance in binary search trees.\n\nIn summary, the primary differences between binary search trees and other tree structures lie in their ordered node arrangement, efficiency in operations, and the specific use cases they are designed to address. Understanding these differences is essential for selecting the appropriate data structure for a given application.
