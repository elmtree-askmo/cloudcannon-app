    What is the purpose of using counter variables in count-controlled loops?
answer: >-
    Counter variables play a crucial role in count-controlled loops, which are a specific type of loop used in programming when the number of iterations is known beforehand. Here are the primary purposes of using counter variables in these loops:\n\n1. **Tracking Iterations**: A counter variable keeps track of how many times the loop has executed. This is essential for ensuring that the loop runs the correct number of times. For example, if you want to execute a block of code 10 times, the counter variable will start at 1 and increment with each iteration until it reaches 10.\n\n2. **Controlling Loop Execution**: The counter variable is often used in the loop's condition to determine whether the loop should continue executing. For instance, in a typical `for` loop structure, the loop will continue as long as the counter variable is less than or equal to a specified limit.\n\n3. **Preventing Infinite Loops**: By incrementing the counter variable within the loop, you help ensure that the loop will eventually terminate. If the counter is not updated correctly, it could lead to an infinite loop, where the loop continues indefinitely because the exit condition is never met.\n\n4. **Facilitating Array and List Iteration**: Counter variables are particularly useful when iterating over arrays or lists. They allow you to access each element in a structured manner, using the counter to index into the array or list.\n\n5. **Improving Code Readability**: Using a counter variable can make the code more understandable. It clearly indicates the number of iterations and the purpose of the loop, which enhances maintainability and readability.\n\nHere is a simple example of a count-controlled loop using a counter variable in Python:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 11):  # i is the counter variable\n    print(i)  # This will print numbers from 1 to 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `i` serves as the counter variable, controlling the number of iterations of the loop, which runs exactly 10 times.\n\nIn summary, counter variables are essential in count-controlled loops for tracking iterations, controlling execution, preventing infinite loops, facilitating data structure access, and improving code clarity.
