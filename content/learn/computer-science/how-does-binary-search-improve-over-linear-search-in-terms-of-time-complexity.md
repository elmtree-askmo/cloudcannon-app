    How does binary search improve over linear search in terms of time complexity?
answer: >-
    Binary search significantly improves over linear search in terms of time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. \n\n1. **Time Complexity**:\n   - **Linear Search**: The time complexity of linear search is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This means that in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm may need to check every element in the array before finding the target value. As the size of the dataset increases, the time taken to search grows linearly, making it inefficient for large datasets.\n   - **Binary Search**: In contrast, binary search has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$. This logarithmic time complexity arises because binary search divides the search interval in half with each step, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target value. \n\n2. **Efficiency**: The efficiency of binary search becomes more pronounced as the size of the dataset increases. For example, while linear search may require up to $n$ comparisons in the worst case, binary search only requires about $\log_2 n$ comparisons. This makes binary search much faster for large datasets, especially when the number of lookups is greater than $\log n$.\n\n3. **Preconditions**: It is important to note that binary search requires the dataset to be sorted beforehand. If the dataset is not sorted, it must be sorted first, which can take $O(n \log n)$ time. However, once sorted, the efficiency of binary search in subsequent lookups makes it a preferred choice for searching in large datasets.\n\nIn summary, binary search is a more efficient algorithm than linear search due to its logarithmic time complexity, making it suitable for large, sorted datasets.
