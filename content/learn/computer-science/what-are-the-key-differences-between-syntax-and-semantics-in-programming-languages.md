    What are the key differences between syntax and semantics in programming languages?
answer: >-
    The key differences between syntax and semantics in programming languages can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Syntax** refers to the set of rules that define the structure and format of valid statements in a programming language. It dictates how symbols, keywords, and punctuation can be combined to create well-formed code. For example, in Python, the syntax for defining a function is:\n     ```python\n     def function_name(parameters):\n         # function body\n     ```\n   - **Semantics**, on the other hand, pertains to the meaning of the syntactically valid statements. It involves understanding what the code does and how it behaves when executed. For instance, the semantic meaning of the above function definition is that it creates a callable function that can be executed with the specified parameters.\n\n2. **Focus**:\n   - Syntax focuses on the form and structure of the code. It is concerned with whether the code is written correctly according to the language's grammar rules. A statement is considered syntactically valid if it adheres to these rules, regardless of whether it makes logical sense.\n   - Semantics focuses on the meaning and behavior of the code. It is concerned with what the code does when executed and how it interacts with data and other parts of the program.\n\n3. **Error Types**:\n   - Syntax errors occur when the code violates the grammatical rules of the programming language. For example, missing a colon at the end of a function definition in Python will result in a syntax error.\n   - Semantic errors occur when the code is syntactically correct but does not produce the intended result. For example, using a variable that has not been initialized will lead to a semantic error, as the program will not behave as expected.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - A syntactically correct but semantically incorrect statement could be:\n     ```python\n     x = "Hello" + 5\n     ```\n     This statement is syntactically valid, but it will raise a runtime error because you cannot concatenate a string and an integer in Python.\n   - Conversely, a syntactically incorrect statement would be:\n     ```python\n     if x > 5\n         print("x is greater than 5")\n     ```\n     This statement is syntactically invalid because it is missing a colon at the end of the `if` statement.\n\nIn summary, while syntax is about the structure and form of code, semantics is about the meaning and behavior of that code when executed. Understanding both is crucial for effective programming and debugging.
