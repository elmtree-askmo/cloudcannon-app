    What techniques are used to split lines into words in text processing?
answer: >-
    In text processing, several techniques are commonly used to split lines into words, a process known as tokenization. Here are some of the primary methods:\n\n1. **Basic Split Method**: The simplest way to split a string into words is by using the `split()` method in Python. This method divides the text at each space by default, returning a list of words.\n   ```python\n   text = "This is a sample text."\n   words = text.split()  # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text.']\n   ```\n\n2. **NLTK's `word_tokenize()`**: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides a more sophisticated method for tokenization. The `word_tokenize()` function can handle punctuation and special characters more effectively than the basic split method.\n   ```python\n   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n   text = "This is a sample text."\n   words = word_tokenize(text)  # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', '.']\n   ```\n\n3. **Regular Expressions**: Using the `re` module in Python, you can define custom patterns to split text. This method is useful for more complex tokenization needs, such as handling contractions or specific punctuation.\n   ```python\n   import re\n   text = "It's a sample text, isn't it?"\n   words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)  # Output: ['It', 's', 'a', 'sample', 'text', 'isn', 't', 'it']\n   ```\n\n4. **SpaCy's Tokenizer**: SpaCy is another powerful library for NLP that includes a built-in tokenizer. It can handle various linguistic features and is optimized for performance.\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n   nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")\n   text = "This is a sample text."\n   doc = nlp(text)\n   words = [token.text for token in doc]  # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'text', '.']\n   ```\n\n5. **Subword and Character Tokenization**: In some applications, especially in deep learning and NLP tasks, text may be tokenized into subwords or individual characters. This can be useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words or for specific model architectures.\n\n6. **Sentence Tokenization**: While not directly splitting lines into words, sentence tokenization (using functions like `sent_tokenize()` from NLTK) is often a precursor to word tokenization, as it breaks text into sentences before further processing.\n\nThese techniques are essential for preparing text data for analysis, modeling, or other natural language processing tasks, as they help clean and structure raw data into a usable format.
