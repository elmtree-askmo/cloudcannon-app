    What exercises can help practice array manipulation in Java?
answer: >-
    To practice array manipulation in Java, here are several exercises that can help you strengthen your skills:\n\n1. **Find Maximum Value**: Create a method called `findMax` that takes an integer array as a parameter and returns the maximum value in the array. Call this method with a sample array and print the maximum value.\n\n2. **Sort Arrays**: Write a Java program to sort both a numeric array and a string array in ascending order. This will help you understand sorting algorithms and their implementation.\n\n3. **Sum of Array Elements**: Write a program that calculates the sum of all values in an integer array. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of array traversal.\n\n4. **Print Index of Array**: Use an array and write a program segment that assigns even-indexed elements their respective index values and assigns the value one to odd-indexed elements. For example, for an array of size 5, the output should be: Index 0: 0, Index 1: 1, Index 2: 2, Index 3: 1, Index 4: 4.\n\n5. **Multiply Elements**: Declare a method called `increaseValues` that takes an array and an integer as input parameters. The method should multiply all elements, except the first and last elements, in the array by the provided integer.\n\n6. **Remove Element Occurrences**: Write a program to remove all occurrences of a specific element from an array. For example, given the array `{10, 20, 10, 30, 50, 10}` and the key `10`, the output should be `{20, 30, 50}`.\n\n7. **Merge Two Arrays**: Create a program that merges two arrays into a single array. This exercise will help you understand how to manipulate multiple arrays simultaneously.\n\n8. **Calculate Average**: Write a program to calculate the average value of the elements in an array. This will help you practice both summation and division operations.\n\n9. **Check for Specific Value**: Write a program to test if an array contains a specific value. This exercise will enhance your searching skills.\n\n10. **Find Index of Element**: Create a program that finds the index of a specific element in an array. If the element is not found, it should return -1.\n\nThese exercises cover a range of array operations, including searching, sorting, and modifying elements, which are essential for mastering array manipulation in Java.
