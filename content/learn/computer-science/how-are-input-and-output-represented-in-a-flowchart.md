    How are input and output represented in a flowchart?
answer: >-
    In flowcharts, which are visual representations of algorithms, input and output operations are typically represented using **parallelograms**. This standardized symbol indicates where data is received (input) and where results are presented (output) within the algorithm.\n\n### Representation of Input and Output in Flowcharts:\n\n1. **Input Steps**: \n   - Parallelograms are used to represent the steps where data is received from the user. For example, if an algorithm requires two numbers from the user, each input operation would be depicted in a parallelogram.\n\n2. **Process Steps**: \n   - Rectangles are used to show the calculation or processing steps. For instance, if the algorithm involves adding the two numbers, this operation would be represented in a rectangle.\n\n3. **Output Step**: \n   - Another parallelogram is used to display the result of the processing. In the case of the sum of two numbers, this parallelogram would show the output, which is the calculated sum.\n\n### Common Flowchart Symbols:\nFlowcharts utilize a variety of symbols to depict different types of operations, including:\n\n- **Ovals**: Represent the start and end of the process (terminal).\n- **Rectangles**: Indicate processes or operations being performed.\n- **Diamonds**: Represent decision points that lead to different paths based on yes/no or true/false outcomes.\n- **Lines with arrows**: Show the flow of control and data between the various steps.\n\nThis visual representation helps in understanding the sequence of steps in an algorithm and is useful for both designing and communicating algorithms effectively. For example, a flowchart for determining the largest of two numbers would start with inputting the numbers, followed by a decision symbol to compare them, and then outputting the larger number.
