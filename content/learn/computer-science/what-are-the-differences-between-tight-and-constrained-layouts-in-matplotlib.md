    What are the differences between tight and constrained layouts in Matplotlib?
answer: >-
    In Matplotlib, both `tight_layout` and `constrained_layout` are used to adjust the spacing between subplots to prevent overlap and ensure that all elements are visible. However, there are key differences between the two:\n\n1. **Functionality**:\n   - **Tight Layout**: The `tight_layout()` function automatically adjusts the padding between and around subplots based on the extents of tick labels, axis labels, and titles. It is a simpler method that may not work well in all situations, especially when dealing with complex layouts or overlapping elements.\n   - **Constrained Layout**: The `constrained_layout` feature is more advanced and flexible. It uses a constraint solver to automatically adjust the positions of subplots, legends, colorbars, and other decorations to avoid overlaps while preserving the logical layout requested by the user. This makes it particularly effective for more complex figures.\n\n2. **Support for Suptitle**:\n   - **Tight Layout**: It does not work well with `suptitle`, which can lead to clashes with other figure text.\n   - **Constrained Layout**: It handles `suptitle` better, allowing for a cleaner integration of titles without overlap.\n\n3. **Handling Uneven Layouts**:\n   - **Tight Layout**: It may struggle with uneven subplot layouts (e.g., different numbers of subplots in different rows or columns).\n   - **Constrained Layout**: It is designed to work effectively with uneven layouts and can adapt dynamically when the figure is resized.\n\n4. **Interactivity**:\n   - **Tight Layout**: It does not adjust automatically when the figure is resized.\n   - **Constrained Layout**: It works interactively, adjusting the layout in response to changes in the figure size.\n\nIn summary, while both methods aim to improve the layout of subplots, `constrained_layout` is generally preferred for its flexibility, ability to handle complex layouts, and better support for titles and interactive resizing.
