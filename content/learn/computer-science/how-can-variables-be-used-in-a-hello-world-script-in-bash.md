    How can variables be used in a 'Hello World' script in Bash?
answer: >-
    To create a simple "Hello World" script in Bash that utilizes variables, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a new script file**: Open your terminal and create a new file named `hello.sh` using a text editor of your choice, such as `nano` or `vim`.\n\n2. **Add the shebang line**: The first line of your script should specify the interpreter. For Bash, this is done with the shebang (`#!`) followed by the path to the Bash executable. \n\n3. **Declare a variable**: You can declare a variable to hold the greeting message.\n\n4. **Use the `echo` command**: This command will output the value of the variable to the terminal.\n\nHereâ€™s an example of what the script might look like:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Declare a variable\ngreeting="Hello, World!"\n\n# Output the value of the variable\necho $greeting\n```\n\n### Steps to Execute the Script:\n\n1. **Make the script executable**: Before running the script, you need to give it execute permissions. You can do this with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x hello.sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script**: Now you can execute the script by typing:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./hello.sh\n   ```\n\nWhen you run the script, it will output:\n\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Script:\n\n- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: This line tells the operating system to use the Bash shell to interpret the script.\n- **Variable Declaration (`greeting="Hello, World!"`)**: This line creates a variable named `greeting` and assigns it the string "Hello, World!".\n- **Echo Command (`echo $greeting`)**: This line prints the value of the `greeting` variable to the terminal. The `$` symbol is used to reference the variable.\n\nUsing variables in your Bash scripts allows for more dynamic and flexible code, as you can easily change the value of the variable without modifying the rest of the script.
