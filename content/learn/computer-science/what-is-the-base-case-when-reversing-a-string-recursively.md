    What is the base case when reversing a string recursively?
answer: >-
    In the context of reversing a string recursively, the base case is a critical component that defines when the recursion should stop. Specifically, the base case for reversing a string can be defined in two ways:\n\n1. **Empty String**: If the input string is empty, the function should return the empty string. This is because there is nothing to reverse, and it serves as a natural stopping point for the recursion.\n   \n   ```scheme\n   (define (reverse str)\n     (if (string=? str "")\n         ""\n         ...))  ; Continue with the recursive case\n   ```\n\n2. **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it is inherently its own reverse. Thus, the function should return the string itself in this case.\n\n   ```scheme\n   (define (reverse str)\n     (if (or (string=? str "") (string=? (string-length str) 1))\n         str\n         ...))  ; Continue with the recursive case\n   ```\n\nOnce the base case is reached, the recursive function will start returning results, allowing the concatenation of characters in reverse order as the recursion unwinds. For example, if the input string is "abc", the function would recursively call itself until it reaches the base case, and then it would concatenate the characters in reverse order as it returns from each recursive call.\n\nIn summary, the base case when reversing a string recursively is when the string is either empty or consists of a single character. This ensures that the recursion has a clear stopping point, preventing infinite recursion and allowing the function to build the reversed string correctly.
