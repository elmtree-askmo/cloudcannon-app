    How do you set minimum size constraints for a window in Tkinter?
answer: >-
    In Tkinter, you can set minimum size constraints for a window using the `minsize()` method. This method allows you to define the minimum width and height of the window, ensuring that the user cannot resize the window smaller than these dimensions. The syntax for using the `minsize()` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nmaster.minsize(width, height)\n```\n\nHere, `width` and `height` are specified in pixels. For example, if you want to set the minimum size of a Tkinter window to 150 pixels in width and 100 pixels in height, you can do it like this:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create an instance of tkinter frame\nwin = tk.Tk()\n\n# Set the minimum size of the window\nwin.minsize(150, 100)\n\n# Create a text label\nlabel = tk.Label(win, text="Window Size is minimized to 150x100", font=('Helvetica bold', 20))\nlabel.pack(pady=20)\n\n# Run the application\nwin.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, the window will not be resizable to dimensions smaller than 150x100 pixels, while still allowing the user to maximize or resize the window larger than these minimum constraints.
