    What are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?
answer: >-
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is centered around the concept of "objects," which can encapsulate both data and methods that operate on that data. The main characteristics of OOP include:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. For example, in Java, you can define a class with private attributes and provide public methods to access and modify those attributes.\n\n   Example in Java:\n   ```java\n   class BankAccount {\n       private double balance;\n\n       public void deposit(double amount) {\n           balance += amount;\n       }\n\n       public double getBalance() {\n           return balance;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Inheritance**: This characteristic allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. For instance, a `Car` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class, gaining its properties and methods while also allowing for additional features specific to cars.\n\n3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is a fundamental concept that allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. This means that a single function can operate on different types of objects, promoting flexibility and reusability in code. For example, a method `draw()` could behave differently when called on a `Circle` object versus a `Square` object.\n\n4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object. This allows programmers to interact with objects at a high level without needing to understand the underlying complexity. Abstract classes and interfaces are common ways to achieve abstraction in OOP.\n\n5. **Classes and Objects**: Classes are the blueprints for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, containing both data and methods. For example, in Python, you can define a simple class as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   class Dog:\n       def __init__(self, name):\n           self.name = name\n       def bark(self):\n           print(f"{self.name} says woof!")\n   ```\n\n6. **Modularity**: OOP encourages modularity, where code is organized into distinct classes and objects. This modular structure makes it easier to manage, maintain, and understand the codebase.\n\nThese characteristics collectively contribute to the robustness, maintainability, and scalability of software applications developed using object-oriented programming. OOP is widely supported in many modern programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and C#.
