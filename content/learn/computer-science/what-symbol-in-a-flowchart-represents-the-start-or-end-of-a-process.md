    What symbol in a flowchart represents the start or end of a process?
answer: >-
    In a flowchart, the symbol that represents the start or end of a process is the **oval** shape, also known as the terminal symbol. This symbol is used to indicate where the process begins and where it concludes, making it a crucial component in the visual representation of algorithms and processes.\n\nTo summarize the key components of a flowchart:\n\n1. **Terminal Symbol (Oval)**: Represents the start and end points of the flowchart.\n2. **Process Symbol (Rectangle)**: Indicates processes or operations being performed.\n3. **Decision Symbol (Diamond)**: Represents decision points with multiple outcomes (e.g., yes/no).\n4. **Input/Output Symbol (Parallelogram)**: Shows where data is received or produced.\n5. **Subroutine Symbol**: Represents a call to a subroutine, which has its own flowchart.\n6. **Flow Lines (Lines with Arrows)**: Indicate the flow of control and data between steps.\n\nThese symbols help in understanding the sequence of steps in an algorithm and are essential for designing and communicating algorithms effectively.
