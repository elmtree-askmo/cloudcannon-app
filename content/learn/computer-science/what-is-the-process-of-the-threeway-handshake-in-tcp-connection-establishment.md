    What is the process of the three-way handshake in TCP connection establishment?
answer: >-
    The process of the three-way handshake in TCP connection establishment is a crucial mechanism that ensures a reliable connection between a client and a server before any data transmission occurs. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in this process:\n\n### Three-Way Handshake Steps\n\n1. **SYN (Synchronize)**:\n   - The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet includes an initial sequence number, which serves as the starting point for data transmission. The SYN packet indicates that the client wants to establish a connection.\n\n2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)**:\n   - Upon receiving the SYN packet, the server responds with a SYN-ACK packet. This packet acknowledges the receipt of the client's SYN and includes the server's own sequence number. The SYN-ACK packet indicates that the server is ready to establish a connection.\n\n3. **ACK (Acknowledge)**:\n   - Finally, the client sends an ACK packet back to the server, confirming the establishment of the connection. This packet acknowledges the receipt of the server's SYN-ACK. At this point, a reliable communication session is established, and both parties are ready to transmit data.\n\n### Summary of the Process\nThe three-way handshake serves several purposes:\n- It ensures that both the client and server are ready for communication.\n- It allows both parties to synchronize their sequence numbers, which is essential for the reliable transmission of data.\n- It establishes a full-duplex communication channel, enabling data to flow in both directions.\n\nThis process is fundamental to the operation of TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to provide reliable data transmission.
