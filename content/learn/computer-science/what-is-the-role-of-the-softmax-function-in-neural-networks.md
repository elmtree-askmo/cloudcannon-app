    What is the role of the softmax function in neural networks?
answer: >-
    The softmax function is a crucial activation function used in neural networks, particularly in the context of multi-class classification tasks. Its primary role is to convert the raw output scores, often referred to as logits, from the final layer of the network into a probability distribution over multiple classes. This transformation is essential because it allows the model to output values that can be interpreted as probabilities, ensuring that they sum to 1.\n\nMathematically, the softmax function is defined as follows for a vector of logits $ z $:\n\n$$\n\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}\n$$\n\nwhere $ K $ is the number of classes, and $ z_i $ is the logit for class $ i $. This formula ensures that each output value is non-negative and that the sum of all output probabilities equals 1, making it suitable for classification tasks where an input needs to be assigned to one of several classes.\n\nIn practical applications, the softmax function is typically applied in the final layer of neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate the decision-making process by providing a clear probabilistic interpretation of the model's predictions. This is particularly important in scenarios where the model must choose among multiple classes, as it allows for more informed and accurate predictions.\n\nOverall, the softmax function plays a vital role in enabling neural networks to perform effectively in multi-class classification problems by transforming logits into a meaningful probability distribution.
