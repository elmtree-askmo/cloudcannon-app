    What are the main limitations of the FedAvg method?
answer: >-
    The FedAvg (Federated Averaging) method, while a foundational approach in federated learning, has several notable limitations, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data and systems. Here are the main limitations:\n\n1. **Non-IID Data Challenges**: FedAvg struggles significantly with non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. In scenarios where client data distributions vary widely, the global model may not perform well for all clients. This is because the aggregation of model updates from clients with different data distributions can lead to a model that does not generalize effectively across all clients.\n\n2. **Heterogeneity in Client Systems**: FedAvg assumes that all participating devices can perform the same amount of local computation and communication. However, in practice, devices may have varying computational capabilities and network conditions, leading to discrepancies in the amount of local work done. This systems heterogeneity can cause the updates to drift away from the global objective, resulting in suboptimal model performance.\n\n3. **Convergence Issues**: The method can diverge in practice, especially in heterogeneous settings. The aggregation of local updates may not converge to the desired global model, particularly when clients perform different amounts of local training or when their data distributions are significantly different.\n\n4. **Loss Divergence and Performance Degradation**: As a result of the aforementioned issues, loss divergence and performance degradation can occur. The model may not only fail to converge but also exhibit poor performance on local tasks, as the common model learned may not be suitable for all clients.\n\n5. **Limited Adaptability**: FedAvg does not incorporate mechanisms to adaptively adjust the learning process based on the characteristics of the local data or the capabilities of the devices. This lack of adaptability can hinder its effectiveness in diverse environments.\n\n6. **Generalization Concerns**: Recent studies have indicated that FedAvg may not reach stationary points of the global optimization objective, even in simpler scenarios like homogeneous linear regression problems. This raises concerns about the generalization of the learned model in the presence of heterogeneity.\n\nTo address these limitations, alternative frameworks such as FedProx have been proposed, which introduce proximal terms to better handle the variability in local data and computation, thereby improving convergence and performance in heterogeneous settings.
