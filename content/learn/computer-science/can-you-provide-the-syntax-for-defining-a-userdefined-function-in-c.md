    Can you provide the syntax for defining a user-defined function in C++?
answer: >-
    In C++, the syntax for defining a user-defined function consists of several key components: the return type, the function name, and the parameters (if any). Here is the general structure:\n\n```cpp\nreturn_type function_name(parameter_type parameter_name) {\n    // function body\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if you want to define a function that adds two integers, the syntax would look like this:\n\n```cpp\nint add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `int` is the return type, indicating that the function will return an integer.\n- `add` is the name of the function.\n- The parameters `int a` and `int b` are the inputs to the function.\n\nIt's important to note that if you define a function after the `main()` function, you must declare it first. This is done using a function prototype, which looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nint add(int a, int b); // Function prototype\n```\n\nThis declaration informs the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters before it is actually defined later in the code. \n\nUser-defined functions are essential for modular programming, allowing you to group code into reusable blocks that can be called from various parts of your program.
