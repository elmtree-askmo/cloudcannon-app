    In the empirical evaluation of federated learning under systems heterogeneity, simulations were performed to assess the impact of varying system characteristics across different devices in the network. The evaluation focused on two primary aspects: systems heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity.\n\n1. **Systems Heterogeneity**: This refers to the significant variability in the hardware, network capabilities, and power resources of the devices participating in the federated learning process. The researchers conducted experiments to simulate these differences, which can lead to varying performance levels among devices. For instance, some devices may have more powerful processors or better network connectivity, affecting their ability to participate effectively in the training process.\n\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: This aspect involves the non-identically distributed data across the network. The empirical evaluation took into account how different data distributions among clients could influence the overall model performance. The researchers aimed to understand how these disparities could affect convergence rates and model accuracy.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the FedProx framework was introduced, which generalizes and re-parameterizes the FedAvg method. This framework allows for variable amounts of work to be performed by different devices, which helps stabilize convergence in the presence of both systems and statistical heterogeneity. The empirical results indicated that using FedProx with a proximal term (where $\mu > 0$) led to more stable convergence and improved test accuracy, with an average absolute accuracy improvement of 22%.\n\nOverall, the simulations were designed to reflect real-world scenarios where devices have different capabilities and data distributions, providing insights into the performance and fairness of federated learning methods in heterogeneous environments.
