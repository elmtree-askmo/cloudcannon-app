    What are the methods for copying arrays in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, there are several methods for copying arrays, each with its own use cases and advantages. Here are the primary methods:\n\n1. **Manual Copying Using a For Loop**: This is the most straightforward method where you create a new array and copy each element from the original array using a loop. For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   int[] copy = new int[original.length];\n   for (int i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {\n       copy[i] = original[i];\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `System.arraycopy()`**: This method is part of the `System` class and allows you to copy a specified portion of the source array to the destination array. It is more efficient than manual copying. The syntax is:\n   ```java\n   System.arraycopy(sourceArray, sourcePosition, destinationArray, destinationPosition, length);\n   ```\n   For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] source = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   int[] destination = new int[5];\n   System.arraycopy(source, 0, destination, 0, source.length);\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `Arrays.copyOf()`**: This method from the `java.util.Arrays` class creates a new array and copies the specified number of elements from the original array. It can also resize the array if the new length is different from the original. The syntax is:\n   ```java\n   int[] newArray = Arrays.copyOf(originalArray, newLength);\n   ```\n   For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   int[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(original, 10); // New array of length 10\n   ```\n\n4. **Using the `clone()` Method**: Each array in Java has a `clone()` method that creates a shallow copy of the array. This method returns a new array with the same contents as the original. For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] original = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   int[] copy = original.clone();\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages. For instance, `System.arraycopy()` is generally faster for large arrays, while `Arrays.copyOf()` provides more flexibility with resizing. The `clone()` method is simple but only creates a shallow copy, which may not be suitable for arrays of objects if deep copying is required.
