    What are the limitations of using Prolog for database manipulation and querying?
answer: >-
    Prolog, while powerful for certain types of database manipulation and querying, has several limitations that can affect its usability and performance in these contexts:\n\n1. **Complexity of Code**: Heavy use of database manipulation in Prolog can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. The reliance on backtracking can make it challenging to trace the flow of execution, especially in programs with many interrelated facts. This complexity can result in "dirty" code that is hard to debug.\n\n2. **Performance Issues**: Although Prolog can handle large databases and interrelated facts effectively, performance may degrade with complex queries or extensive backtracking. The depth-first search strategy used by Prolog can lead to inefficiencies, particularly if the search space is large or if there are many possible variable bindings.\n\n3. **Lack of Graphical Features**: Prolog does not inherently support graphical features, which can limit its usability in applications that require visual data representation or user interfaces. This can be a drawback for projects that need to present data in a more accessible format.\n\n4. **Input and Output Complexity**: The algorithms and codes for various input and output operations in Prolog can be complex and may not be intuitive for all users. This complexity can hinder the ease of data manipulation and querying, especially for those who are not familiar with Prolog's syntax and operational paradigms.\n\n5. **Non-Logical Extensions**: The database capabilities in Prolog are considered non-logical extensions to the language. This means that while Prolog can be used for database queries, it may not always align with traditional database management principles, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or results.\n\n6. **Limited Data Types**: Prolog's strength lies in its handling of facts and rules, but it may not be as flexible as other database systems when it comes to managing complex data types or structures. This limitation can restrict the types of data that can be effectively manipulated within a Prolog database.\n\nIn summary, while Prolog offers unique advantages for certain types of database queries, its limitations in complexity, performance, and data handling can pose challenges for developers and users.
