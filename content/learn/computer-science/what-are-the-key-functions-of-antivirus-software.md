    What are the key functions of antivirus software?
answer: >-
    Antivirus software plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems by performing several key functions:\n\n1. **Malware Detection and Removal**: The primary function of antivirus software is to identify and eliminate malicious software, commonly referred to as malware. This includes viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and other harmful programs that can compromise system stability and security.\n\n2. **Real-Time Protection**: Antivirus software provides continuous monitoring of the system to detect and respond to threats as they occur. This real-time protection helps prevent malware from infecting the device in the first place.\n\n3. **Signature-Based Detection**: Most antivirus programs maintain a database of known malware signatures. When a file is scanned, the software compares it against this database to identify any known threats.\n\n4. **Heuristic Analysis**: In addition to signature-based detection, antivirus software often employs heuristic analysis to identify new or unknown malware by examining the behavior of programs. This method can detect potentially harmful actions that may indicate the presence of a virus.\n\n5. **Quarantine and Deletion**: Upon detecting malware, antivirus software typically either deletes the malicious files or places them in quarantine. Quarantine isolates the infected files to prevent them from causing further harm while allowing users to review them.\n\n6. **Email and Web Protection**: Many antivirus solutions include features that scan incoming emails and web traffic for malicious content, helping to prevent phishing attacks and the download of harmful files.\n\n7. **Regular Updates**: To remain effective against the ever-evolving landscape of malware, antivirus software requires regular updates. These updates ensure that the software's database of known threats is current, allowing it to detect the latest malware.\n\n8. **System Performance Monitoring**: Some antivirus programs also monitor system performance and can alert users to potential issues caused by malware, such as unusual spikes in CPU or memory usage.\n\n9. **Additional Security Features**: Many antivirus solutions come bundled with additional security features, such as firewalls, password managers, and tools for protecting against ransomware and phishing attacks.\n\nIn summary, antivirus software is essential for protecting devices from a wide range of cyber threats, ensuring the safety of personal data and the overall functionality of the system.
