    How do Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms differ in finding minimum spanning trees?
answer: >-
    Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are both greedy algorithms used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. However, they differ significantly in their approach and implementation.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n1. **Approach**:\n   - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: This algorithm focuses on edges. It starts with an empty graph and adds edges in increasing order of weight, ensuring that no cycles are formed. It uses a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to keep track of which vertices are in which components, allowing it to efficiently check for cycles.\n   - **Prim's Algorithm**: This algorithm focuses on vertices. It starts with a single vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside of it. It uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next edge with the minimum weight.\n\n2. **Data Structure**:\n   - **Krus
