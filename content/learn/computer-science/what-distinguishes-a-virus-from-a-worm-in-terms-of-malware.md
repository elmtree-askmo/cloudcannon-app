    What distinguishes a virus from a worm in terms of malware?
answer: >-
    The distinction between a virus and a worm in terms of malware primarily revolves around their methods of propagation and activation.\n\n1. **Propagation Method**:\n   - **Virus**: A virus requires user interaction to spread. It attaches itself to executable files or programs and remains dormant until the infected file is executed by the user. Once activated, it can replicate itself by modifying other files on the system. Viruses typically spread through email attachments, downloads, or infected USB drives.\n   - **Worm**: In contrast, a worm is capable of self-replication and can spread independently across networks without any user intervention. It exploits vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to propagate itself to other computers. Worms can scan for open ports or vulnerable devices, allowing them to spread rapidly through networks.\n\n2. **Activation**:\n   - **Virus**: The activation of a virus occurs when the infected file is opened or executed by the user. This means that the virus relies on the user to inadvertently trigger its malicious code.\n   - **Worm**: A worm activates itself automatically once it has successfully infiltrated a network or system. It does not require any action from the user to spread, making it potentially more dangerous in terms of rapid propagation.\n\n3. **Impact**:\n   - **Virus**: Viruses can corrupt or modify files, leading to data loss or system malfunctions. They often aim to disrupt the normal functioning of the computer.\n   - **Worm**: Worms primarily consume network bandwidth and can cause network congestion. They may also delete files or install additional malicious software, but their primary function is to replicate and spread.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in how they spread (viruses need user action and attach to files, while worms self-replicate and spread autonomously) and their activation mechanisms (viruses activate upon execution of infected files, whereas worms activate upon successful infiltration).
