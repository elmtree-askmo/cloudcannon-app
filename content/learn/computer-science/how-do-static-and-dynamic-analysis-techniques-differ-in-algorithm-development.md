    How do static and dynamic analysis techniques differ in algorithm development?
answer: >-
    Static and dynamic analysis techniques are two fundamental approaches used in algorithm development and software engineering, each with distinct characteristics and applications.\n\n### Static Analysis\n\nStatic analysis involves examining the code without executing it. This technique is typically performed at compile time and focuses on identifying potential errors, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues before the program runs. Key aspects of static analysis include:\n\n1. **Type Checking**: Static analysis can enforce type constraints, ensuring that variables are used consistently according to their declared types. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process.\n\n2. **Code Quality**: Tools for static analysis, such as SonarQube and ESLint, can evaluate code for adherence to coding standards, detect unreachable code, and identify potential bugs or inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Performance Predictions**: While static analysis cannot measure runtime performance directly, it can provide insights into potential performance issues based on code structure and complexity.\n\n4. **Early Detection**: By identifying issues before execution, static analysis can reduce debugging time and improve overall code reliability.\n\n### Dynamic Analysis\n\nDynamic analysis, on the other hand, involves examining the program while it is running. This technique provides insights into the actual behavior of the code during execution, which can reveal issues that static analysis might miss. Key aspects of dynamic analysis include:\n\n1. **Runtime Monitoring**: Dynamic analysis tools can monitor the execution of a program to identify runtime errors, performance bottlenecks, and memory usage patterns. This includes profiling to measure time and space complexity.\n\n2. **Behavioral Insights**: By analyzing how the program behaves with real input data, dynamic analysis can uncover unexpected results, infinite loops, and other runtime anomalies.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: Dynamic analysis is often used in conjunction with testing frameworks to validate the correctness of algorithms and ensure that they perform as expected under various conditions.\n\n4. **Optimization Opportunities**: Profiling during dynamic analysis can help identify specific areas of code that require optimization, allowing developers to focus their efforts on the most critical performance bottlenecks.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n- **Execution Context**: Static analysis is performed without executing the program, while dynamic analysis requires the program to be run.\n- **Error Detection**: Static analysis can catch errors related to syntax and type before runtime, whereas dynamic analysis can identify runtime errors and performance issues.\n- **Performance Measurement**: Static analysis provides theoretical insights into performance, while dynamic analysis offers empirical data based on actual execution.\n\nIn conclusion, both static and dynamic analysis techniques are essential in algorithm development. Static analysis helps ensure code quality and correctness before execution, while dynamic analysis provides valuable insights into the program's behavior during runtime, enabling developers to optimize and refine their algorithms effectively.
