    What is method overloading, and how does it differ from polymorphism in object-oriented programming?
answer: >-
    Method overloading and polymorphism are both important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways.\n\n### Method Overloading\nMethod overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but differ in their parameter lists (i.e., the number or type of parameters). This allows a class to perform similar operations with different types or numbers of inputs. The method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the method signature.\n\n**Example in Java:**\n```java\nclass MathUtils {\n    // Method to add two integers\n    int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n\n    // Overloaded method to add three integers\n    int add(int a, int b, int c) {\n        return a + b + c;\n    }\n\n    // Overloaded method to add two doubles\n    double add(double a, double b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `add` method is overloaded with different parameter types and counts.\n\n### Polymorphism\nPolymorphism, on the other hand, refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to be invoked on objects of different types, and the correct method implementation is determined at runtime. This is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n\n**Example in Java:**\n```java\nclass Animal {\n    void makeSound() {\n        System.out.println("Animal sound");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    void makeSound() {\n        System.out.println("Woof!");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat extends Animal {\n    void makeSound() {\n        System.out.println("Meow!");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class TestPolymorphism {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Animal myDog = new Dog();\n        Animal myCat = new Cat();\n        \n        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof!\n        myCat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Meow!\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` classes override the `makeSound` method from the `Animal` class. The method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Binding Time**:\n   - **Method Overloading**: Resolved at compile time (static binding).\n   - **Polymorphism**: Resolved at runtime (dynamic binding).\n\n2. **Purpose**:\n   - **Method Overloading**: Provides multiple ways to perform a similar operation with different inputs.\n   - **Polymorphism**: Allows for a unified interface to interact with different object types, enhancing flexibility and reusability.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - **Method Overloading**: Involves methods within the same class.\n   - **Polymorphism**: Involves methods across different classes that share a common superclass or interface.\n\nIn summary, while both method overloading and polymorphism enhance the functionality and flexibility of OOP, they do so in different ways and are used for different purposes.
