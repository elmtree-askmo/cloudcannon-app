    How do constants differ from variables in programming?
answer: >-
    In programming, constants and variables serve different purposes, and their key differences can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Variables**: A variable is a storage location identified by a name that can hold different values during the execution of a program. The value of a variable can change over time.\n   - **Constants**: A constant is a fixed value that, once defined, cannot be altered throughout the program. Constants are used to represent values that should remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Mutability**:\n   - **Variables**: The value of a variable can be modified at any point in the program. For example, in Python:\n     ```python\n     x = 10\n     x = 20  # x can be changed\n     ```\n   - **Constants**: The value of a constant is immutable. For instance, in many programming languages, you can define a constant using specific keywords (like `const` in C/C++ or `final` in Java):\n     ```java\n     final int MAX_VALUE = 100;  // MAX_VALUE cannot be changed\n     ```\n\n3. **Scope and Binding**:\n   - Both constants and variables can have local or global scope, but constants are often used to define values that are intended to be universally accessible and unchangeable within that scope.\n   - Constants can be bound statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at runtime), but their values remain constant once set.\n\n4. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Variables**: Used for storing data that may change, such as user input, counters, or temporary calculations.\n   - **Constants**: Used for defining fixed values that enhance code readability and maintainability, such as mathematical constants (e.g., Ï€), configuration settings, or fixed limits.\n\n5. **Benefits**:\n   - Using constants can improve code reliability and readability, as it makes the intention clear that certain values should not change. This can help prevent bugs related to unintended modifications of values.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between constants and variables lies in their mutability: variables can change their values, while constants are fixed and unchangeable once defined. This distinction is crucial for effective programming and helps in maintaining the integrity of data throughout the execution of a program.
