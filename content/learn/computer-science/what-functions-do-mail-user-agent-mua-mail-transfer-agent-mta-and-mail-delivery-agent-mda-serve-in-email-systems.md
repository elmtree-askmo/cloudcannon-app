    In email systems, the roles of Mail User Agent (MUA), Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), and Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) are crucial for the successful sending and receiving of emails. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their functions:\n\n1. **Mail User Agent (MUA)**: This is the email client that users interact with to compose, send, and receive emails. Examples of MUAs include applications like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail. When a user wants to send an email, the MUA creates the message and hands it over to the Mail Submission Agent (MSA) for further processing.\n\n2. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: The MTA is responsible for transferring emails between servers. After the MUA submits the email to the MSA, the MSA forwards it to the MTA. The MTA uses protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send the email to the recipient's MTA. The MTA ensures that the email is routed correctly across the network to reach its destination.\n\n3. **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)**: Once the email arrives at the recipient's MTA, it is then passed to the MDA. The MDA is responsible for delivering the email to the recipient's mailbox. It stores the email until the recipient retrieves it using their MUA, typically through protocols like Post Office Protocol (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).\n\nIn summary, the MUA is the interface for users to send and receive emails, the MTA handles the transfer of emails between servers, and the MDA ensures that emails are delivered to the correct mailbox for retrieval by the recipient. Together, these components form the backbone of email communication systems.
