    To determine the number of hosts required per subnet and allocate addresses efficiently, you can follow a systematic approach that involves understanding subnetting strategies, calculating the necessary subnet mask, and applying efficient address allocation techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Assess Requirements\n1. **Identify the Number of Subnets Needed**: Determine how many subnets you require based on organizational needs. For example, if you need 10 subnets.\n2. **Determine the Number of Hosts per Subnet**: Assess how many hosts each subnet will need. For instance, if the largest subnet requires 40 hosts.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Subnet Mask\nTo calculate the subnet mask, you need to ensure that the subnet can accommodate the required number of hosts. The formula to calculate the number of usable hosts in a subnet is:\n\n$$\n\text{Usable Hosts} = 2^H - 2\n$$\n\nwhere $ H $ is the number of bits allocated for the host portion. The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address and the broadcast address.\n\n#### Example Calculation:\n- For 40 hosts, you need at least $ H $ such that:\n  $$ \n  2^H - 2 \geq 40 \n  $$\n  Solving this gives:\n  - $ H = 6 $ (since $ 2^6 - 2 = 62 $, which is sufficient)\n  \n- The total number of bits in an IPv4 address is 32. Therefore, the number of bits for the network portion is:\n  $$\n  N = 32 - H = 32 - 6 = 26\n  $$\n  \n- This means you will use a subnet mask of /26, which corresponds to:\n  - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192\n\n### Step 3: Allocate Subnets\nWith a /26 subnet mask, you can create multiple subnets. Each /26 subnet can accommodate 64 IP addresses (62 usable). \n\n#### Number of Subnets:\nTo find out how many subnets you can create from a larger network, use the formula:\n$$\n\text{Number of Subnets} = 2^{(N - m)}\n$$\nwhere $ N $ is the total number of bits in the original network and $ m $ is the number of bits used for the subnetting.\n\nFor example, if you start with a /22 network (which has 10 bits for hosts):\n- $ N = 22 $\n- $ m = 26 $\n- Number of Subnets = \( 2^{(26 - 22)} = 2^4 = 16 \) subnets.\n\n### Step 4: Efficient Address Allocation\n1. **Minimize Unused Addresses**: Allocate subnets based on the actual number of hosts required to minimize wasted IP addresses.\n2. **Use Private vs. Public Address Space**: Utilize private IP addresses for internal networks and public addresses for external-facing services.\n3. **Document Subnet Allocations**: Keep a record of which subnets are allocated to which departments or services to manage IP address space effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently determine the number of hosts required per subnet and allocate addresses in a way that optimizes network performance and resource utilization. Understanding subnetting strategies, calculating subnet masks, and planning for future growth are essential for effective network management.
