    The Chomsky Hierarchy classifies formal languages into four types: Type 0 (Recursively Enumerable), Type 1 (Context-Sensitive), Type 2 (Context-Free), and Type 3 (Regular), based on their generative power and associated grammars and automata.

    What are the different types of languages in the Chomsky Hierarchy?
answer: >-
    The Chomsky Hierarchy is a classification of formal languages based on their generative power, structured into four distinct levels:\n\n1. **Type 0 - Recursively Enumerable Languages**: These languages are generated by unrestricted grammars. They can be recognized by Turing machines, which means they can represent any computation that can be performed algorithmically. There are no restrictions on the production rules in this type of grammar.\n\n2. **Type 1 - Context-Sensitive Languages**: These languages are generated by context-sensitive grammars. They can be recognized by linear-bounded automata, which are Turing machines with limited tape. The production rules in context-sensitive grammars must ensure that the length of the string on the left-hand side of a production is less than or equal to the length of the string on the right-hand side.\n\n3. **Type 2 - Context-Free Languages**: These languages are generated by context-free grammars. They can be recognized by pushdown automata, which are finite automata equipped with a stack. The production rules in context-free grammars allow a single non-terminal to be replaced by a string of terminals and non-terminals, making them suitable for describing programming languages and natural languages.\n\n4. **Type 3 - Regular Languages**: These languages are generated by regular grammars. They can be recognized by finite automata. The production rules in regular grammars are highly restricted, allowing only a single non-terminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side that consists of a single terminal or a single terminal followed by a single non-terminal.\n\nThis hierarchy illustrates the relationships between different types of languages and their respective grammars and automata, with each type having increasing constraints and computational power.
