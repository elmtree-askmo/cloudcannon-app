    Who was Douglas Engelbart and what was his contribution to early GUI development?
answer: >-
    Douglas Engelbart (January 30, 1925 â€“ July 2, 2013) was an American inventor and a pivotal figure in the development of early graphical user interfaces (GUIs). His contributions to computing began in the 1950s and included several groundbreaking innovations that have had a lasting impact on how humans interact with computers.\n\nOne of Engelbart's most significant inventions was the computer mouse, which he developed in 1963 as part of his work on the oN-Line System (NLS) at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The mouse was designed to facilitate user interaction with graphical displays, allowing for more intuitive navigation and manipulation of data on screens. Engelbart's early prototype was made of wood and utilized a circuit board with two wheels to track movement.\n\nIn addition to the mouse, Engelbart was instrumental in the development of the graphical user interface itself. His work on NLS included features such as multiple-window displays and hypermedia, which allowed for the linking of various types of content (text, images, video, and sound) within a single document. Engelbart's vision extended beyond mere interface design; he conceptualized computers as tools to augment human intelligence and foster collaboration.\n\nEngelbart's contributions also included the first public demonstration of video conferencing and collaborative document editing, showcasing the potential for real-time digital communication. His pioneering work laid the groundwork for future developments in personal computing, influencing major companies like Apple and Microsoft in their GUI designs.\n\nOverall, Engelbart's innovations not only shaped the evolution of user interfaces but also helped to establish the foundational concepts of networked computing and groupware, making him a key figure in the history of computing technology.
