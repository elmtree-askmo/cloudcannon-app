    How do you add and remove elements from a vector in C++?
answer: >-
    In C++, the `std::vector` container provides a flexible and efficient way to manage dynamic arrays, allowing you to easily add and remove elements. Here’s a detailed overview of how to perform these operations:\n\n### Adding Elements to a Vector\n\n1. **Using `push_back()`**:\n   The `push_back()` method is the most straightforward way to add an element to the end of a vector. This method increases the size of the vector by one and appends the new element at the end.\n   ```cpp\n   std::vector<int> vec;\n   vec.push_back(10); // Adds 10 to the end of the vector\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `insert()`**:\n   The `insert()` function allows you to add elements at any specified position within the vector. You can insert a single element or multiple elements.\n   ```cpp\n   std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};\n   vec.insert(vec.begin() + 1, 5); // Inserts 5 at index 1\n   // vec now contains {1, 5, 2, 3}\n   ```\n\n### Removing Elements from a Vector\n\n1. **Using `pop_back()`**:\n   The `pop_back()` method removes the last element from the vector. This is an efficient operation as it does not require shifting elements.\n   ```cpp\n   vec.pop_back(); // Removes the last element from the vector\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `erase()`**:\n   The `erase()` function can remove a single element or a range of elements from the vector. When removing a single element, you specify the position of the element to be removed. For a range, you specify the start and end iterators.\n   ```cpp\n   std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   vec.erase(vec.begin() + 2); // Removes the element at index 2 (which is 3)\n   // vec now contains {1, 2, 4, 5}\n\n   // To remove a range of elements\n   vec.erase(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + 2); // Removes elements from index 0 to 1\n   // vec now contains {4, 5}\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `clear()`**:\n   If you want to remove all elements from the vector, you can use the `clear()` method. This will empty the vector but not change its capacity.\n   ```cpp\n   vec.clear(); // Removes all elements from the vector\n   ```\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere’s a complete example that demonstrates adding and removing elements from a vector:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare a vector of integers\n    std::vector<int> numbers;\n\n    // Add elements to the vector\n    numbers.push_back(10);\n    numbers.push_back(20);\n    numbers.push_back(30);\n    numbers.push_back(40);\n    numbers.push_back(50);\n\n    // Display the elements of the vector\n    std::cout << "Elements in the vector: ";\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {\n        std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    // Remove the last element\n    numbers.pop_back();\n\n    // Display the elements after pop_back\n    std::cout << "After pop_back: ";\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {\n        std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    // Remove an element at a specific position\n    numbers.erase(numbers.begin() + 1); // Removes the element at index 1\n\n    // Display the elements after erase\n    std::cout << "After erase: ";\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {\n        std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    // Clear the vector\n    numbers.clear();\n    std::cout << "After clear, size: " << numbers.size() << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis example illustrates how to add elements using `push_back()`, remove the last element with `pop_back()`, remove a specific element with `erase()`, and clear the vector with `clear()`.
