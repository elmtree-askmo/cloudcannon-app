    How can you read from standard input in Bash?
answer: >-
    In Bash, reading from standard input (stdin) is primarily accomplished using the `read` command. This command allows you to accept user input interactively or read from a specified input source, such as a file. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how to use the `read` command and its functionalities:\n\n### Basic Syntax\nThe basic syntax of the `read` command is as follows:\n```bash\nread variable\n```\nThis command reads a line of input from stdin and assigns it to the specified variable.\n\n### Options for the `read` Command\nThe `read` command comes with several useful options:\n- `-p`: This option allows you to display a prompt before reading input.\n- `-d`: This option specifies a delimiter to split the input into multiple variables.\n\n### Examples of Using `read`\n1. **Basic Input**:\n   ```bash\n   read name\n   echo "Hello, $name!"\n   ```\n   In this example, the script prompts the user to enter their name and then greets them.\n\n2. **Using a Prompt**:\n   ```bash\n   read -p "Enter your age: " age\n   echo "You are $age years old."\n   ```\n   Here, the `-p` option is used to display a prompt before reading the input.\n\n3. **Reading Multiple Variables**:\n   ```bash\n   read first_name last_name\n   echo "Your full name is $first_name $last_name."\n   ```\n   This command reads two words from the input and assigns them to two different variables.\n\n4. **Using a Delimiter**:\n   ```bash\n   read -d ',' fruits\n   echo "Fruits: $fruits"\n   ```\n   In this example, the `-d` option allows the user to input a list of fruits separated by commas.\n\n### Reading from Files\nYou can also use the `read` command to read input from files. For example:\n```bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    echo "$line"\ndone < filename.txt\n```\nThis script reads each line from `filename.txt` and prints it to the standard output.\n\n### Input Redirection\nBash also allows you to redirect input from a file using the `<` operator. For example:\n```bash\nread variable < input.txt\n```\nThis command reads the first line of `input.txt` and assigns it to `variable`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe `read` command is a powerful built-in utility in Bash that facilitates user interaction and input handling in scripts. By mastering its syntax and options, you can create more dynamic and interactive Bash scripts.
