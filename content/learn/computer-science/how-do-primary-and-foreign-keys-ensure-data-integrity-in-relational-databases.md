    How do primary and foreign keys ensure data integrity in relational databases?
answer: >-
    Primary and foreign keys are fundamental components of relational databases that play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity. Hereâ€™s how they contribute to maintaining data integrity:\n\n### Primary Keys\n\n1. **Uniqueness**: A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. This means that no two rows can have the same primary key value, which prevents duplicate records. For example, in a table of students, the student ID can serve as a primary key, ensuring that each student is represented only once.\n\n2. **Non-nullability**: Primary keys cannot contain NULL values. This requirement ensures that every record has a valid identifier, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the data. If a record lacks a primary key value, it cannot be uniquely identified, leading to potential data inconsistencies.\n\n3. **Referential Integrity**: Primary keys enforce referential integrity by ensuring that relationships between tables are valid. When a primary key is referenced by a foreign key in another table, it guarantees that the foreign key value must match an existing primary key value, thus maintaining the integrity of the relationships.\n\n4. **Facilitating Relationships**: Primary keys enable the establishment of relationships between different tables in a relational database. By linking tables through primary and foreign keys, databases can represent complex relationships and ensure that data remains interconnected and coherent.\n\n5. **Normalization**: The use of primary keys is a fundamental aspect of database normalization, which aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. By organizing data into related tables and defining primary keys, databases can minimize duplication and ensure that data is stored efficiently.\n\n### Foreign Keys\n\n1. **Establishing Relationships**: Foreign keys create a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. This relationship allows for the representation of complex data structures and ensures that data across tables remains consistent.\n\n2. **Enforcing Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity by ensuring that a foreign key value in one table must correspond to an existing primary key value in another table. This prevents orphaned records and maintains the logical consistency of the database.\n\n3. **Facilitating Complex Queries**: Foreign keys enable complex queries that involve multiple tables. By using SQL JOIN operations, users can retrieve related data from different tables efficiently. For example, a query can join the `Students` table with the `Enrollments` table to find out which courses each student is enrolled in.\n\n4. **Normalization**: Foreign keys are essential in the normalization process, which aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency. By separating data into different tables and linking them through foreign keys, databases can minimize duplication and ensure that updates are made in a single location.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, primary keys are essential for maintaining data integrity in relational databases by ensuring uniqueness, preventing NULL values, enforcing referential integrity, promoting data consistency, facilitating relationships, and supporting normalization practices. Foreign keys complement this by establishing and enforcing relationships between tables, maintaining data integrity, and facilitating complex data retrieval through SQL. Together, these features contribute to a reliable and efficient database design.
