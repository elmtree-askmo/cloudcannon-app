    What are the different types of Finite Automata?
answer: >-
    Finite automata are abstract machines used in computer science to recognize patterns within input sequences. There are two primary types of finite automata:\n\n1. **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**: \n   - A DFA is defined as a five-tuple \( M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, F, \delta) \), where:\n     - $ Q $ is a finite set of states.\n     - $ \Sigma $ is a finite set of input symbols (the alphabet).\n     - $ q_0 $ is the initial state (where the automaton starts).\n     - $ F $ is a set of accepting states (final states).\n     - $ \delta $ is the transition function, which maps a state and an input symbol to a single next state.\n   - In a DFA, for each input symbol, the machine transitions to one and only one state, meaning there are no ambiguous transitions. Additionally, there are no null transitions, so every state must have a defined transition for every input symbol.\n\n2. **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**:\n   - An NFA is also defined as a five-tuple \( M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, F, \delta) \), similar to a DFA, but with a key difference in the transition function $ \delta $.\n   - In an NFA, for a given state and input symbol, the machine can transition to multiple possible next states or even none at all. This means that there can be several possible paths for processing an input string, allowing for more flexibility in state transitions.\n   - NFAs can also include epsilon (Îµ) transitions, which allow the automaton to move to a new state without consuming any input symbol.\n\nThese two types of finite automata serve as foundational concepts in automata theory and are essential for understanding regular languages and their applications in various fields, including computer science, linguistics, and formal verification.
