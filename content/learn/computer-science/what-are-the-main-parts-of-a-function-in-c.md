    What are the main parts of a function in C++?
answer: >-
    In C++, a function consists of several key parts that define its structure and behavior. The main components of a function in C++ are:\n\n1. **Function Declaration (Prototype)**: This part specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any). It informs the compiler about the function's existence before it is used in the code. The syntax for a function declaration is as follows:\n   ```cpp\n   returnType functionName(parameterType1 parameterName1, parameterType2 parameterName2, ...);\n   ```\n\n2. **Function Definition**: This is where the actual implementation of the function resides. It includes the function's body, which contains the code that will be executed when the function is called. The body is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. The syntax for a function definition is similar to that of a declaration but includes the body:\n   ```cpp\n   returnType functionName(parameterType1 parameterName1, parameterType2 parameterName2, ...) {\n       // Function body\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Return Type**: This specifies the type of value that the function will return to the caller. If the function does not return a value, the return type is specified as `void`.\n\n4. **Function Parameters**: These are the inputs to the function. They allow data to be passed into the function when it is called. Parameters are defined within the parentheses in both the declaration and definition.\n\n5. **Function Body**: This is the block of code that defines what the function does. It contains the statements that are executed when the function is called.\n\nFor example, a simple function that adds two integers might look like this:\n\n```cpp\nint add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `int` is the return type.\n- `add` is the function name.\n- `int a` and `int b` are the parameters.\n- The body of the function contains the code that performs the addition and returns the result.\n\nUnderstanding these components is crucial for writing effective and organized C++ programs, as functions help in modularizing code and enhancing reusability.
