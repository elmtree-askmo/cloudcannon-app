    How is bubble sort implemented in Java arrays?
answer: >-
    Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that operates by repeatedly stepping through the array, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. Although Bubble Sort is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, it serves as a fundamental example for understanding sorting algorithms.\n\n### Implementation of Bubble Sort in Java\n\nHere is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class BubbleSort {\n    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {\n        int n = arr.length;\n        boolean swapped;\n        \n        // Outer loop for the number of passes\n        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n            swapped = false; // Track if a swap occurred\n            \n            // Inner loop for comparing adjacent elements\n            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {\n                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n                    int temp = arr[j];\n                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                    arr[j + 1] = temp;\n                    swapped = true; // A swap occurred\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // If no swaps occurred, the array is sorted\n            if (!swapped) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] arr = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8};\n        bubbleSort(arr);\n        System.out.println("Sorted array:");\n        for (int num : arr) {\n            System.out.print(num + " ");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from the first element to the second last element of the array. It controls the number of passes through the array.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements. If the current element is greater than the next one, they are swapped.\n3. **Swapping**: A temporary variable is used to hold one of the values during the swap.\n4. **Optimization**: The `swapped` boolean flag is used to track whether any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps occurred, the array is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.\n\n### Complexity\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. The best-case time complexity is $O(n)$ when the array is already sorted.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is $O(1)$ since it requires a constant amount of additional space.\n\nBubble Sort is primarily used for educational purposes due to its simplicity, making it a valuable concept for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of sorting algorithms.
