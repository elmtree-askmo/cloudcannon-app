answer: >-
    To systematically refactor code that involves global variables, several strategies can be employed to enhance code maintainability and clarity. Here are some effective techniques:\n\n1. **Limit Access to Global Variables**: Minimize the number of global variables and restrict their access as much as possible. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects and makes the code easier to understand. For instance, consider encapsulating global variables within a class or module, which can help manage their scope and access.\n\n2. **Encapsulate Global State**: Instead of using multiple global variables, group related global variables into a single object or class. This approach allows you to manage state more effectively and reduces the complexity associated with multiple global variables. For example, you could create a `GlobalState` class that holds all necessary global variables as properties.\n\n3. **Refactor to Use Function Parameters**: Where possible, replace global variables with function parameters. This makes the dependencies of functions explicit and improves code readability. For instance, instead of relying on a global variable for state, pass the required state as an argument to functions.\n\n4. **Use Dependency Injection**: This technique involves passing dependencies (like global state) into functions or classes rather than relying on global variables. This not only makes the code more modular but also facilitates easier testing and maintenance.\n\n5. **Rename Global Variables**: If global variables are necessary, ensure they have clear and descriptive names to avoid confusion with local variables. Avoid generic names like `count` or `temp`, which can lead to bugs and misunderstandings.\n\n6. **Gradual Removal of Global Variables**: As you refactor, aim to gradually eliminate global variables. Start by identifying which global variables are essential and which can be removed or replaced. Over time, you can work towards a codebase that minimizes or completely removes the reliance on global state.\n\n7. **Implement Testing**: Use unit tests to ensure that the refactored code behaves as expected. This is particularly important when modifying how global state is managed, as it helps catch any regressions or unintended side effects introduced during refactoring.\n\n8. **Adopt Best Practices**: Follow best practices in software development, such as the Single Responsibility Principle, which encourages keeping functions and classes focused on a single task. This can help reduce the need for global variables by promoting better design.\n\nBy employing these strategies, developers can systematically refactor code that relies on global variables, leading to improved maintainability, clarity, and overall code quality.
