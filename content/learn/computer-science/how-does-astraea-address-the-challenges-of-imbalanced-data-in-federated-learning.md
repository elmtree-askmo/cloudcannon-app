    How does Astraea address the challenges of imbalanced data in federated learning?
answer: >-
    Astraea is a self-balancing federated learning framework designed to address the challenges posed by imbalanced data in federated learning (FL). Imbalanced datasets can lead to significant accuracy degradation in FL applications, as the model may become biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance on minority classes.\n\nAstraea employs two primary strategies to mitigate these imbalances:\n\n1. **Global Data Distribution-Based Data Augmentation**: Before training the model, Astraea performs data augmentation based on the global distribution of data. This approach helps to alleviate the global imbalance by generating synthetic data points for underrepresented classes, thereby enhancing the diversity of the training data available to the model.\n\n2. **Mediator-Based Multi-Client Rescheduling**: Astraea introduces mediators that facilitate the rescheduling of clients based on their data distribution. This strategy ensures that clients with more balanced datasets are prioritized during the training process, which helps to improve the overall model performance by ensuring that the training data is more representative of the underlying distribution.\n\nBy integrating these two strategies, Astraea effectively counters the negative impacts of imbalanced data in federated learning, leading to improved accuracy and robustness of the models trained in such environments.
