    What are the common errors encountered when running a Prolog program?
answer: >-
    When running a Prolog program, several common errors can be encountered. Understanding these errors can help in debugging and improving the overall quality of the code. Here are some of the most frequent issues:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: These occur when the Prolog code is not written according to the language's grammatical rules. For example, missing commas, incorrect predicate definitions, or unmatched parentheses can lead to syntax errors.\n\n2. **Type Errors**: These happen when the wrong type of data is used in a Prolog program. For instance, attempting to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric types can trigger a type error.\n\n3. **Logic Errors**: These are more subtle and occur when the program does not produce the expected results due to incorrect logic in the predicates. This might happen if the rules defined do not accurately represent the intended logic.\n\n4. **Instantiation Errors**: This error arises when a variable is used that has not been instantiated (i.e., assigned a value) before it is used in a predicate.\n\n5. **Uninstantiation Errors**: Conversely, this error occurs when a predicate expects a variable to be uninstantiated but finds it already instantiated.\n\n6. **Domain Errors**: These occur when a value is outside the expected range for a particular operation or predicate.\n\n7. **Existence Errors**: This type of error is reported when a predicate is called that does not exist in the knowledge base.\n\n8. **Permission Errors**: These errors can occur when there is an attempt to perform an operation that is not permitted, such as trying to modify a read-only predicate.\n\n9. **Compiler Errors**: During compilation, errors can arise from illegal clauses or attempts to redefine system predicates. These are reported using the `print_message/2` predicate.\n\n10. **Warnings**: While not errors per se, warnings can indicate potential issues in the code that may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nBy being aware of these common errors, Prolog programmers can take proactive steps to avoid them, leading to more robust and reliable code. Debugging tools and features available in environments like Visual Studio Code can also assist in identifying and resolving these issues effectively.
