answer: >-
    To view the IP configuration on a Windows host, you can use the command `ipconfig` in the command line interface. This command provides essential details about the network configuration, including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.\n\nFor more comprehensive information, including the MAC address and additional Layer 3 addressing details, you can use the command:\n\n```\nipconfig /all\n```\n\nIf you need to manage DHCP settings, you can also release and renew the IP address configuration using the following commands:\n\n```\nipconfig /release\nipconfig /renew\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you want to view the DNS cache entries, you can use:\n\n```\nipconfig /displaydns\n```\n\nThese commands are essential for troubleshooting and managing network settings on a Windows host.
