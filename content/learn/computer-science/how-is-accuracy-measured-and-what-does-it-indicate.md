    How is accuracy measured and what does it indicate?
answer: >-
    Accuracy is a fundamental metric used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of classification models. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. The formula for calculating accuracy is:\n\n$$\n\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $TP$ (True Positives) is the number of correct positive predictions,\n- $TN$ (True Negatives) is the number of correct negative predictions,\n- $FP$ (False Positives) is the number of incorrect positive predictions, and\n- $FN$ (False Negatives) is the number of incorrect negative predictions.\n\nAccuracy provides a straightforward measure of how well a model performs its intended task, particularly in binary classification contexts. A perfect model would achieve an accuracy of 1.0, or 100%, indicating that it made no errors in its predictions.\n\nHowever, while accuracy is intuitive and easy to compute, it has limitations, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets. In such cases, a high accuracy score might not reflect the model's true performance, as it could be biased towards the majority class. For example, if a model simply predicts the majority class for all instances, it could still achieve high accuracy without actually being useful for predicting the minority class.\n\nIn summary, accuracy is a critical metric that indicates the overall correctness of a model's predictions, but it should be used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
