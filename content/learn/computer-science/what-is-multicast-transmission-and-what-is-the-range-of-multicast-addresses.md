    Multicast transmission is a networking method that allows data to be efficiently sent from one host to a group of subscribed hosts using a specific multicast address range in IPv4, defined as 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.

    What is multicast transmission, and what is the range of multicast addresses?
answer: >-
    Multicast transmission is a method of communication in networking where a packet is sent from one host to a specific group of hosts that have subscribed to a particular multicast address. This allows for efficient data distribution to multiple recipients without the need to send separate copies of the data to each recipient, as is the case with unicast transmission.\n\nIn IPv4, multicast addresses are defined within the range of 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. This range is designated for multicast communication, and addresses within this range can be used to send packets to multiple hosts that are part of a multicast group. \n\nTo summarize:\n- **Multicast Transmission**: Sending data from one host to a group of hosts.\n- **Range of Multicast Addresses**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.\n\nThis method is particularly useful for applications such as streaming media, where the same data needs to be sent to multiple users simultaneously.
