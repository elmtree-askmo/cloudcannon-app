    Discuss two disadvantages of expert systems concerning training and costs.
answer: >-
    Expert systems, while beneficial in many applications, come with notable disadvantages, particularly concerning training and costs. Here are two key disadvantages related to these aspects:\n\n1. **High Initial Costs**: Implementing an expert system can be financially burdensome, especially for smaller organizations. The initial investment often includes expenses for new hardware, software, and the development of the knowledge base. Additionally, businesses may need to hire human experts to assist in knowledge acquisition, which further escalates costs. This high upfront expenditure can deter organizations from adopting expert systems, particularly if they are uncertain about the return on investment.\n\n2. **Ongoing Training and Maintenance Costs**: Beyond the initial setup, expert systems require continuous updates and maintenance to remain effective. This includes costs associated with training personnel to use the system effectively and ensuring that the knowledge base is kept current with the latest information and practices. As the domain knowledge evolves, the system must be updated, which can involve significant time and financial resources. This ongoing commitment can strain budgets and resources, particularly in dynamic fields where knowledge changes rapidly.\n\nThese disadvantages highlight the financial and resource-intensive nature of expert systems, which can limit their accessibility and practicality for some organizations.
