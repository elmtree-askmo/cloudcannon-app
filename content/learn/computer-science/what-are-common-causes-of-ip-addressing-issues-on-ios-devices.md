    What are common causes of IP addressing issues on IOS devices?
answer: >-
    Common causes of IP addressing issues on IOS devices include:\n\n1. **Manual Assignment Errors**: When network administrators manually assign IP addresses to devices, mistakes can occur. This may involve assigning the same IP address to multiple devices, using an incorrect subnet mask, or failing to configure the default gateway properly. Such errors can lead to communication issues within the network.\n\n2. **DHCP-Related Problems**: Issues can arise when devices rely on DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for IP address assignment. This may include DHCP server misconfigurations, such as incorrect IP address pools or lease times, or network connectivity issues that prevent devices from reaching the DHCP server.\n\n3. **Misconfigured Interfaces**: An interface may be incorrectly configured, leading to IP addressing issues. This can include settings such as incorrect encapsulation types or VLAN assignments that do not match the intended network design.\n\n4. **IP Address Conflicts**: If two devices are assigned the same IP address, it can cause conflicts that disrupt network communication. This can happen due to manual assignment errors or DHCP server misconfigurations.\n\n5. **Subnetting Issues**: Incorrect subnetting can lead to devices being unable to communicate with each other. For example, if devices are on different subnets without proper routing, they will not be able to reach each other.\n\nTo troubleshoot these issues, network administrators can use commands such as `show ip interface` or `show ip interface brief` to verify the assigned IP addresses and interface statuses. This helps in identifying and resolving any discrepancies in the IP addressing configuration.
