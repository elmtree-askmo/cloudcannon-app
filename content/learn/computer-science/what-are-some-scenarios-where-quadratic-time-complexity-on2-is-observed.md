    What are some scenarios where quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)) is observed?
answer: >-
    Quadratic time complexity, denoted as O(n²), is observed in various scenarios, particularly when algorithms involve nested iterations over the input data. Here are some common scenarios where O(n²) time complexity is typically encountered:\n\n1. **Inefficient Sorting Algorithms**: \n   - **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The worst-case time complexity is O(n²) because for each element, it may need to compare with every other element.\n   - **Insertion Sort**: Similar to bubble sort, insertion sort builds a sorted array one element at a time. In the worst case, it requires O(n²) comparisons and shifts.\n   - **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region, resulting in O(n²) time complexity.\n\n2. **Nested Loops**: \n   - Algorithms that involve two nested loops, where each loop iterates over the input data, will typically exhibit O(n²) time complexity. For example, checking all pairs of elements in an array to find duplicates or to compute a similarity measure.\n\n3. **Matrix Operations**: \n   - Operations that involve traversing a 2D array or matrix, such as transposing a matrix or performing certain types of matrix multiplication, can also lead to O(n²) complexity due to the need to access each element in relation to every other element.\n\n4. **Brute Force Solutions**: \n   - Many brute force algorithms that attempt to solve problems by checking all possible combinations or configurations will have quadratic time complexity. For instance, finding all pairs of elements that sum to a specific value in an array.\n\n5. **Graph Algorithms**: \n   - Certain graph algorithms, particularly those that involve checking all pairs of vertices (like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths), can exhibit O(n²) time complexity.\n\nIn summary, O(n²) time complexity is commonly found in algorithms that involve nested iterations over the input data, particularly in sorting algorithms and brute force solutions. Understanding these scenarios is crucial for technical interview preparation and for optimizing algorithm performance in practical applications.
