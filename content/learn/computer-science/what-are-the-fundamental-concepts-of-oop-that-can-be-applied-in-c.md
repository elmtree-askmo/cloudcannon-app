    The fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that can be applied in C are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Although C is primarily a procedural programming language, these OOP principles can still be implemented through specific techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of each concept:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, often referred to as a class in other OOP languages. In C, encapsulation can be achieved using structures (`struct`) to group related data together, and by using function pointers to associate functions with these structures. This limits access to the data and protects it from unintended interference.\n\n   Example:\n   ```c\n   typedef struct {\n       int x;\n       int y;\n   } Point;\n\n   void setPoint(Point *p, int x, int y) {\n       p->x = x;\n       p->y = y;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and organization. While C does not support inheritance natively, it can be simulated by embedding one structure within another. This allows a new structure to inherit the properties of an existing structure.\n\n   Example:\n   ```c\n   typedef struct {\n       int x;\n       int y;\n   } Point;\n\n   typedef struct {\n       Point base; // Inheriting Point\n       int z;\n   } Point3D;\n   ```\n\n3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In C, this can be implemented using function pointers, allowing different functions to be called based on the type of object being referenced.\n\n   Example:\n   ```c\n   typedef struct {\n       void (*draw)(void);\n   } Shape;\n\n   void drawCircle() {\n       // Drawing circle logic\n   }\n\n   void drawSquare() {\n       // Drawing square logic\n   }\n\n   Shape circle = { drawCircle };\n   Shape square = { drawSquare };\n\n   circle.draw(); // Calls drawCircle\n   square.draw(); // Calls drawSquare\n   ```\n\n### Comparison with Procedural Programming\nIn procedural programming, the focus is on writing procedures or functions that operate on data, whereas OOP emphasizes creating objects that encapsulate both data and behavior. This shift allows for better organization, modularity, and reusability of code. OOP also enhances security by restricting access to the internal state of objects, which is less emphasized in procedural programming.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile C is not inherently an object-oriented language, developers can implement OOP concepts through careful design using structures and function pointers. This approach can lead to more organized and maintainable code, aligning with the principles of OOP.
