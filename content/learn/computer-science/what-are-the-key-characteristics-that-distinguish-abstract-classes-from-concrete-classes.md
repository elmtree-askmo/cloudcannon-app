answer: >-
    Abstract classes and concrete classes are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Java and C++. Here are the key characteristics that distinguish abstract classes from concrete classes:\n\n1. **Instantiation**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. This means you cannot create an object of an abstract class using the `new` keyword. It serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class can be instantiated, allowing you to create objects from it using the `new` keyword.\n\n2. **Method Definition**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (methods without an implementation) and concrete methods (methods with an implementation). Even if it has just one abstract method, the class is considered abstract.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class can only have concrete methods. It does not contain any abstract methods, meaning all methods must have an implementation.\n\n3. **Declaration**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: An abstract class is declared using the `abstract` modifier. If a class is declared as abstract, it cannot be instantiated directly.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class is not declared with the `abstract` keyword. If it is declared as abstract, it will also become an abstract class.\n\n4. **Inheritance**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: When a class inherits from an abstract class, it is required to provide implementations for all abstract methods defined in the abstract class. This creates a contract that the derived class must fulfill.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class does not have any obligation to override or implement methods from a base class unless it chooses to do so.\n\n5. **Purpose**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: The primary purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface and shared behavior for derived classes. It allows for code reuse and establishes a framework for future classes.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class is designed to be instantiated and used directly. It represents a complete implementation of the functionality defined by its methods.\n\n6. **State**:\n   - **Abstract Class**: An abstract class can have state (instance variables) that can be inherited by subclasses.\n   - **Concrete Class**: A concrete class can also have state, and it can be directly manipulated through its instances.\n\nIn summary, abstract classes serve as templates for other classes, enforcing a structure and behavior that derived classes must adhere to, while concrete classes are fully implemented and can be instantiated to create objects. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective design in object-oriented programming.
