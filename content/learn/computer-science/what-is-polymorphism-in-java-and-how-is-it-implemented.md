    What is polymorphism in Java, and how is it implemented?
answer: >-
    Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming that allows objects to take on multiple forms. The term "polymorphism" is derived from the Greek words "poly," meaning "many," and "morphs," meaning "forms." In Java, polymorphism enables methods to perform different tasks based on the object that it is acting upon, thus promoting flexibility and reusability in code.\n\n### Types of Polymorphism in Java\n\nPolymorphism in Java can be categorized into two main types:\n\n1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**:\n   - This type of polymorphism is achieved through **method overloading**. Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different type or number of parameters). The method to be invoked is determined at compile time based on the method signature.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```java\n     class Calculator {\n         int sum(int a, int b) {\n             return a + b;\n         }\n         double sum(double a, double b) {\n             return a + b;\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n   In this example, the `sum` method is overloaded with different parameter types, and the appropriate method is called based on the arguments passed.\n\n2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**:\n   - This type of polymorphism is achieved through **method overriding**. In this case, a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```java\n     class Animal {\n         void sound() {\n             System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");\n         }\n     }\n     class Dog extends Animal {\n         void sound() {\n             System.out.println("Dog barks");\n         }\n     }\n     class Cat extends Animal {\n         void sound() {\n             System.out.println("Cat meows");\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n   In this example, the `sound` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. When you call the `sound` method on an `Animal` reference that points to a `Dog` or `Cat` object, the appropriate method is invoked based on the actual object type at runtime.\n\n### Importance of Polymorphism\n\nPolymorphism is essential in Java as it enhances code flexibility and maintainability. It allows developers to write more generic and reusable code, making it easier to manage and extend applications. By using polymorphism, you can define a single interface for multiple implementations, which simplifies the code and reduces redundancy.\n\nIn summary, polymorphism in Java is a powerful feature that allows for method overloading and method overriding, enabling developers to create more dynamic and adaptable applications. Understanding and implementing polymorphism is crucial for any aspiring Java developer.
