    What were the key components of the experimental setup for evaluating FedProx?
answer: >-
    The experimental setup for evaluating FedProx involved several key components designed to assess its performance in comparison to other federated learning algorithms. Here are the main elements of the setup:\n\n1. **Objective**: The primary task was image classification, which is a common benchmark in machine learning.\n\n2. **Models Used**: Two models were implemented for the experiments:\n   - A logistic regression model specifically used for the MNIST dataset.\n   - A two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was also referenced in the FedAvg paper.\n\n3. **Datasets**: The experiments utilized three well-known open-source datasets:\n   - MNIST (handwritten digit classification)\n   - CIFAR-10 (image classification with 10 classes)\n   - CIFAR-100 (image classification with 100 classes)\n\n4. **Comparison Algorithms**: FedProx was compared against three state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms:\n   - FedAvg\n   - MOON\n   - SOLO\n   Additionally, a baseline was established where each client trained its own model on local datasets without federated learning.\n\n5. **Key Parameters**: The performance of FedProx was influenced by several parameters, notably:\n   - The number of local epochs, denoted as \(E\), which determines how many times each client trains on its local data before sending updates.\n   - The proximal term scaled by \(\mu\), which controls the degree of personalization in the model updates.\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics**: The empirical evaluation focused on the convergence behavior of FedProx, particularly in heterogeneous settings. The results were analyzed to demonstrate improvements in stability and accuracy compared to FedAvg, especially under conditions of significant variability in client capabilities and data distributions.\n\n7. **Theoretical and Empirical Validation**: The experimental results were designed to validate the theoretical analysis of FedProx, showcasing its robustness in handling both statistical and systems heterogeneity in federated networks.\n\nThis comprehensive setup allowed for a thorough investigation of FedProx's capabilities and its advantages over existing federated learning methods.
