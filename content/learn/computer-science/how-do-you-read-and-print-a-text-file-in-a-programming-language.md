    How do you read and print a text file in a programming language?
answer: >-
    To read and print a text file in a programming language, let's focus on Python and C as examples, as they are commonly used for file handling.\n\n### Reading a Text File in Python\n\nIn Python, you can read a text file using the built-in `open()` function. Here’s a step-by-step guide along with an example:\n\n1. **Open the File**: Use the `open()` function to open the file. You need to specify the filename and the mode (usually 'r' for reading).\n2. **Read the Content**: You can read the entire content at once using `.read()`, read line by line using `.readline()`, or read all lines into a list using `.readlines()`.\n3. **Print the Content**: After reading, you can print the content.\n4. **Close the File**: It’s important to close the file after you are done to free up system resources.\n\nHere’s an example of how to read and print the content of a file named `world.txt`:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode\nwith open('world.txt', 'r') as file:\n    # Read the content of the file\n    content = file.read()\n    # Print the content\n    print(content)\n```\n\nUsing the `with` statement automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed, which is a good practice.\n\n### Reading a Text File in C\n\nIn C, you can read a text file using standard file handling functions. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the File**: Use `fopen()` to open the file.\n2. **Read the Content**: You can use `fgets()` to read the file line by line or `fgetc()` to read character by character.\n3. **Print the Content**: Print the content as you read it.\n4. **Close the File**: Use `fclose()` to close the file.\n\nHere’s an example of reading and printing a file in C:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    FILE *fptr;\n    char buffer[100];\n\n    // Open the file in read mode\n    fptr = fopen("world.txt", "r");\n    if (fptr == NULL) {\n        printf("Error opening file.\n");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Read and print each line\n    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fptr) != NULL) {\n        printf("%s", buffer);\n    }\n\n    // Close the file\n    fclose(fptr);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, reading and printing a text file involves opening the file, reading its content, printing it, and then closing the file. The methods and functions used vary between programming languages, but the overall process remains similar.
