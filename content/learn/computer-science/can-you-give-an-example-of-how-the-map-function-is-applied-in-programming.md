    The `map` function is a powerful tool in both Python and JavaScript, commonly used in functional programming to apply a specific function to each item in an iterable, such as a list or array. Below are examples of how the `map` function is applied in both languages.\n\n### Python Example\n\nIn Python, the `map()` function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable (like a list). It applies the function to each item in the iterable and returns a map object, which can be converted to a list.\n\nHere’s a simple example that converts a list of strings representing numbers into integers:\n\n```python\n# Define a function to convert strings to integers\ndef convert_to_int(s):\n    return int(s)\n\n# List of strings\nstring_numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]\n\n# Use map to apply the function to each item in the list\nint_numbers = list(map(convert_to_int, string_numbers))\n\nprint(int_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `convert_to_int` function is applied to each element of the `string_numbers` list, resulting in a new list of integers.\n\n### JavaScript Example\n\nIn JavaScript, the `map()` method is called on an array and takes a callback function as an argument. It creates a new array populated with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the calling array.\n\nHere’s an example that converts an array of strings to uppercase:\n\n```javascript\n// Array of strings\nconst stringArray = ["hello", "world", "javascript"];\n\n// Use map to convert each string to uppercase\nconst upperCaseArray = stringArray.map(str => str.toUpperCase());\n\nconsole.log(upperCaseArray);  // Output: ["HELLO", "WORLD", "JAVASCRIPT"]\n```\n\nIn this JavaScript example, the arrow function `str => str.toUpperCase()` is applied to each element of `stringArray`, resulting in a new array with all strings in uppercase.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `map` function is essential for transforming data efficiently in both Python and JavaScript. It allows developers to apply a function to each element of an iterable without the need for explicit loops, promoting cleaner and more readable code.
