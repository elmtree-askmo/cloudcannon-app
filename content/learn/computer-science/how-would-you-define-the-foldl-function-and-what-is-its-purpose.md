    How would you define the foldL function and what is its purpose?
answer: >-
    The `foldl` function, also known as "fold left," is a higher-order function commonly used in functional programming. Its primary purpose is to process a data structure, typically a list, in a left-to-right manner while accumulating a result. This is achieved by applying a specified binary function to an initial accumulator value and each element of the list sequentially, ultimately returning a single aggregated result.\n\n### Definition and Functionality\nThe `foldl` function can be defined as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{foldl} : (acc \to elem \to acc) \to acc \to [elem] \to acc\n$$\n\nHere, the first argument is a binary function that takes two parameters: the accumulator (`acc`) and the current element of the list (`elem`). The second argument is the initial value of the accumulator, and the third argument is the list to be processed.\n\nFor example, if we have a list `[2, 1, 5, 2]` and we want to sum its elements using `foldl`, we can express it as:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# Define the binary function for addition\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Using foldl (reduce in Python)\nresult = reduce(add, [2, 1, 5, 2], 0)  # Initial accumulator value is 0\nprint(result)  # Output: 10\n```\n\nIn this example, the evaluation proceeds as follows:\n1. Start with the initial accumulator value of `0`.\n2. Apply the function: `0 + 2 = 2`\n3. Next: `2 + 1 = 3`\n4. Then: `3 + 5 = 8`\n5. Finally: `8 + 2 = 10`\n\n### Characteristics\n- **Eager Evaluation**: `foldl` is eager, meaning it computes the result immediately as it processes each element. This can lead to issues when dealing with infinite lists, as it cannot handle them directly.\n- **Associativity**: The order of operations matters in `foldl`, as it processes elements from the leftmost to the rightmost. This is in contrast to its sibling function `foldr` (fold right), which processes from right to left.\n\n### Use Cases\n`foldl` is particularly useful for tasks such as:\n- Summing a list of numbers.\n- Concatenating strings.\n- Accumulating results from a list of data structures.\n\nIn summary, `foldl` is a powerful tool in functional programming that allows for elegant and efficient list processing by accumulating results through a specified binary function.
