    Define randomized algorithms and describe their characteristics.
answer: >-
    A **randomized algorithm** is an algorithm that incorporates randomness as part of its logic or procedure. This randomness can be used to influence the algorithm's behavior, often leading to improved performance in terms of average-case running time or output quality. Here are some key characteristics of randomized algorithms:\n\n1. **Use of Randomness**: Randomized algorithms utilize random bits as auxiliary input to guide their operations. This randomness can be introduced at various stages of the algorithm, affecting decisions made during execution.\n\n2. **Average-Case Performance**: One of the primary motivations for using randomized algorithms is to achieve good average-case performance. While deterministic algorithms may have a fixed running time for a given input, randomized algorithms can often perform better on average across all possible inputs.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Guarantees**: Randomized algorithms can provide probabilistic guarantees about their outputs. For instance, they may produce correct results with high probability or yield results that are close to the optimal solution.\n\n4. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Many randomized algorithms are simpler to implement than their deterministic counterparts. They can also lead to more efficient solutions, particularly for complex problems where deterministic approaches may be cumbersome or inefficient.\n\n5. **Types of Randomized Algorithms**: There are two main types of randomized algorithms:\n   - **Las Vegas Algorithms**: These algorithms always produce the correct result, but their running time may vary. An example is randomized quicksort, which selects a pivot randomly and sorts the array based on that pivot.\n   - **Monte Carlo Algorithms**: These algorithms may produce incorrect results with a certain probability, but they have a guaranteed running time. An example is a randomized algorithm for approximating the solution to a problem where exact solutions are computationally expensive.\n\n6. **Examples**: Common examples of randomized algorithms include:\n   - **Randomized Quick Sort**: This algorithm randomly selects a pivot element to partition the array, which helps in achieving better average-case performance.\n   - **Karger's Algorithm**: A randomized algorithm for finding the minimum cut in a graph, which relies on random edge selection.\n\nIn summary, randomized algorithms leverage randomness to enhance performance, simplify design, and provide probabilistic guarantees, making them a powerful tool in algorithm design and analysis.
