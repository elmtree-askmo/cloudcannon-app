    How can user input be incorporated into a 'Hello World' script in Bash?
answer: >-
    To incorporate user input into a "Hello World" script in Bash, you can use the `read` command to prompt the user for their name and then display a personalized greeting. Below is a simple example of how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a new Bash script file** (e.g., `hello.sh`).\n2. **Add the following lines to the file**:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is a bash script to greet the user\n\n# Prompt for the user's name\necho "Please enter your name:"\nread name  # Capture user input into the variable 'name'\n\n# Output a personalized greeting\necho "Hello, $name! Welcome to the world of Bash scripting!"\n```\n\n3. **Save the file** and make it executable by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x hello.sh\n```\n\n4. **Run the script**:\n\n```bash\n./hello.sh\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Script:\n- The first line `#!/bin/bash` is known as the shebang line, which indicates that the script should be run using the Bash interpreter.\n- The `echo` command is used to display a prompt asking the user to enter their name.\n- The `read name` command waits for the user to input their name and stores it in the variable `name`.\n- Finally, another `echo` command outputs a personalized greeting that includes the user's name.\n\nThis simple script demonstrates how to read user input and use it to create a more interactive experience in Bash scripting.
