    What are the best practices for importing libraries in a Python script?
answer: >-
    When importing libraries in a Python script, following best practices can enhance code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here are some key best practices for importing libraries in Python:\n\n1. **Group Your Imports**: Organize your imports into logical groups. Typically, you should have three sections:\n   - Standard library imports\n   - Related third-party imports\n   - Local application/library-specific imports\n   Each section should be separated by a blank line.\n\n2. **Import at the Top**: Place all import statements at the top of your Python file, just after any module comments or docstrings. This makes it clear which dependencies are required for the module.\n\n3. **Use Absolute Imports**: Prefer absolute imports over relative imports for clarity. Absolute imports specify the full path to the module, making it easier to understand where the module is located within the package structure.\n\n4. **Avoid Wildcard Imports**: Instead of using `from module import *`, which can lead to naming conflicts and makes it unclear which names are present in the namespace, explicitly import only the functions or classes you need. For example:\n   ```python\n   from math import sqrt, pi\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Aliases When Necessary**: If a module name is long or if there are naming conflicts, use the `as` keyword to create an alias. This can improve readability:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   ```\n\n6. **Separate Multiple Imports**: When importing multiple modules, list each import on a separate line rather than chaining them together. This enhances readability:\n   ```python\n   import numpy\n   import pandas\n   ```\n\n7. **Be Consistent**: Maintain a consistent style throughout your codebase. This includes how you import modules, whether you use aliases, and how you group imports.\n\n8. **Document Imports**: If an import is not immediately obvious (e.g., a less common library), consider adding a comment explaining its purpose.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, you can ensure that your Python scripts are clean, organized, and easy to understand for both yourself and others who may work with your code in the future.
