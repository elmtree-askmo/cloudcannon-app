    What kind of support team is available for students in this course?
answer: >-
    In the Machine Learning course, students have access to a dedicated support team that includes instructors and teaching assistants (TAs). The instructors are responsible for delivering lectures and guiding students through the course material, while TAs assist with answering questions, providing feedback on assignments, and facilitating discussions. This support structure is designed to help students navigate the complexities of machine learning systems and ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.\n\nAdditionally, students can expect to have office hours where they can seek further assistance and clarification on course topics. The collaborative environment encourages students to engage with the support team and their peers, fostering a community of learning.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the support team or how to access their help, feel free to ask!
