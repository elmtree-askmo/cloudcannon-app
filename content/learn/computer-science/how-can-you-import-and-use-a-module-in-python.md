    How can you import and use a module in Python?
answer: >-
    To import and use a module in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Importing a Module**: You can import a module using the `import` statement. For example, if you want to import the built-in `math` module, you would write:\n\n   ```python\n   import math\n   ```\n\n   After this, you can access functions and variables defined in the `math` module using the syntax `math.function_name()`.\n\n2. **Using an Alias**: If you want to give a module a shorter name, you can use the `as` keyword to create an alias. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   import math as m\n   print(m.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n   ```\n\n3. **Importing Specific Functions or Variables**: If you only need specific functions or variables from a module, you can import them directly using the `from` keyword. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from math import sqrt, pi\n   print(sqrt(25))  # Outputs: 5.0\n   print(pi)        # Outputs: 3.141592653589793\n   ```\n\n4. **Importing All Functions from a Module**: You can import all functions and variables from a module using the `*` operator, but this is generally discouraged as it can lead to confusion with variable names. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from math import *\n   print(sqrt(36))  # Outputs: 6.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Creating Your Own Module**: You can create your own module by writing a Python file (e.g., `mymodule.py`) that contains functions, classes, or variables. You can then import this module in another Python file:\n\n   ```python\n   # mymodule.py\n   def greet(name):\n       return f"Hello, {name}!"\n\n   # main.py\n   import mymodule\n   print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n   ```\n\n6. **Module Scope**: When you import a module, it does not automatically add its functions to the current namespace. You need to use the module name to access its functions unless you import them directly.\n\n7. **Handling Import Errors**: If you try to import a module that does not exist, Python will raise an `ImportError`. You can handle this using a `try...except` block:\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import non_existent_module\n   except ImportError:\n       print("Module not found.")\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively import and use modules in Python, enhancing the reusability and organization of your code.
