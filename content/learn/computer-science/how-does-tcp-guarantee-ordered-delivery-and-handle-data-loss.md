    How does TCP guarantee ordered delivery and handle data loss?
answer: >-
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) guarantees ordered delivery and handles data loss through several key mechanisms:\n\n### 1. Ordered Delivery\nTCP ensures that data packets are received in the same order they were sent. This is achieved using **sequence numbers** assigned to each segment in the TCP header. When a sender transmits data, each segment is tagged with a sequence number that indicates its position in the overall data stream. The receiver uses these sequence numbers to reorder segments that may arrive out of order, ensuring that the application receives the data in the correct sequence.\n\n### 2. Acknowledgment Mechanism\nTCP employs an acknowledgment (ACK) system to confirm the successful receipt of data. When a receiver gets a segment, it sends back an acknowledgment to the sender. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment for a segment within a certain timeframe, it assumes that the segment was lost and retransmits it. This mechanism is crucial for ensuring that all data is delivered reliably.\n\n### 3. Retransmission of Lost Segments\nIn the event of data loss, TCP has built-in mechanisms to retransmit unacknowledged segments. If a segment is not acknowledged, TCP will resend it, ensuring that the data eventually reaches its destination. This process is part of TCP's reliability features, which are essential for applications that require guaranteed delivery.\n\n### 4. Flow Control\nTCP uses flow control to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver. This is accomplished through a sliding window mechanism, which allows the sender to send multiple segments before needing an acknowledgment, but limits the amount of unacknowledged data in transit. This helps prevent overwhelming the receiver and ensures smooth data flow.\n\n### 5. Congestion Control\nTCP also implements congestion control algorithms to avoid network congestion, which can lead to packet loss. Techniques such as slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery help TCP adapt to changing network conditions, minimizing the chances of data loss due to congestion.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, TCP guarantees ordered delivery and handles data loss through the use of sequence numbers, acknowledgment mechanisms, retransmission of lost segments, flow control, and congestion control. These features make TCP a reliable choice for applications that require consistent and accurate data transmission, such as web browsing and email.
