    What is the process for creating a button widget in Tkinter?
answer: >-
    Creating a button widget in Tkinter is a straightforward process. Below is a step-by-step guide along with a code example to illustrate how to create a button in a Tkinter application.\n\n### Steps to Create a Button Widget in Tkinter\n\n1. **Import the Tkinter Module**: First, you need to import the Tkinter module. You can do this by using `import tkinter as tk`.\n\n2. **Create the Main Window**: Initialize the main application window using `Tk()`.\n\n3. **Define a Callback Function**: This function will be executed when the button is clicked. It should be defined before creating the button.\n\n4. **Create the Button Widget**: Use the `Button` class to create a button. You can specify parameters such as the parent window, button text, and the command (callback function) to be executed on click.\n\n5. **Pack the Button**: Use the `pack()` method to add the button to the window.\n\n6. **Run the Main Event Loop**: Finally, call `mainloop()` to run the application.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere is a simple example that demonstrates how to create a button in Tkinter:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\n\n# Create the main window\nmaster = tk.Tk()\nmaster.geometry("300x300")  # Set the window size\n\n# Define the button callback function\ndef buttonCallback():\n    messagebox.showinfo("Message", "You have clicked the Button!")\n\n# Create the button widget\nbutton = tk.Button(master, text="Click Me!", command=buttonCallback)\n\n# Pack the button into the window\nbutton.pack(pady=20)  # Add some vertical padding\n\n# Run the main event loop\nmaster.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Import Statements**: The code imports the necessary Tkinter modules.\n- **Main Window**: A main window (`master`) is created with a specified size.\n- **Callback Function**: The `buttonCallback` function shows a message box when the button is clicked.\n- **Button Creation**: A button labeled "Click Me!" is created, which calls `buttonCallback` when clicked.\n- **Packing the Button**: The button is added to the window using the `pack()` method, with some padding for better layout.\n- **Event Loop**: The `mainloop()` method keeps the application running and responsive to user interactions.\n\nThis example provides a basic understanding of how to create and use a button widget in a Tkinter application. You can further customize the button's appearance and behavior by modifying its properties.
