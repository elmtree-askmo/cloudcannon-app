    How do you call a function with parameters in Python?
answer: >-
    In Python, you can call a function with parameters by using the function's name followed by parentheses, inside which you provide the arguments corresponding to the parameters defined in the function. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: First, you need to define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and the parameters in parentheses. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   def multiply(a, b):\n       return a * b\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `multiply` is a function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Call the Function**: To call the function, you simply use its name followed by parentheses, passing the required arguments. For instance:\n\n   ```python\n   result = multiply(3, 4)\n   print(result)  # Output: 12\n   ```\n\n   Here, `3` and `4` are the arguments passed to the `multiply` function, which returns their product.\n\n3. **Using Different Arguments**: You can call the same function multiple times with different arguments:\n\n   ```python\n   print(multiply(5, 6))  # Output: 30\n   print(multiply(10, 2))  # Output: 20\n   ```\n\nThis demonstrates how to create and call functions with parameters in Python, allowing for code reusability and modular programming.
