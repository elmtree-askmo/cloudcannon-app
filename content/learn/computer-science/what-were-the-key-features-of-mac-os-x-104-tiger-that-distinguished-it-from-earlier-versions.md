    Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, released on April 29, 2005, introduced several key features that distinguished it from its predecessor, Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.

Spotlight provided instant search results as users typed, significantly improving the user experience compared to previous search functionalities.\n\n2. **Dashboard**: Tiger introduced Dashboard, a feature that allowed users to access mini-applications called widgets.

It also introduced parental controls and improved overall performance.\n\n4. **Safari 2**: The new version of the Safari web browser included features like improved RSS support, a built-in search field, and a more streamlined interface, making web browsing faster and more user-friendly.\n\n5. **Automator**: This new application allowed users to automate repetitive tasks without needing to know programming. Automator provided a user-friendly interface for creating workflows, which could save time and increase productivity.\n\n6. **64-bit Support**: Tiger improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac G5s, allowing applications to utilize more memory and enhancing performance for demanding tasks.\n\n7. **Unified Theme**: Tiger introduced a new 'Unified' theme that provided a more cohesive and visually appealing interface across the operating system.\n\n8. **Over 200 New Features**: Apple advertised that Tiger included over 200 new and improved features, enhancing the overall functionality and reliability of the operating system.\n\nThese features collectively made Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger a significant upgrade, focusing on usability, performance, and the introduction of innovative tools that catered to both casual users and professionals.
