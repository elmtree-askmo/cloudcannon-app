    What are the limitations of Json 11 compared to other JSON libraries in C++?
answer: >-
    The Json 11 library, while offering some advantages, has several limitations compared to other JSON libraries in C++. Here are some key points of comparison:\n\n1. **Performance**: Json 11 may not be as fast as some other libraries, such as yyjson, which is noted for its competitive performance. In benchmarks, libraries like nlohmann/json can be significantly slower—up to 10 times slower—than faster alternatives. This can be a critical factor for applications that require high-performance JSON parsing and generation.\n\n2. **Modification Limitations**: Json 11 has an opaque wrapper around its JsonValue, which means that you cannot modify an instance of Json directly. This can be a drawback for developers who need to frequently update JSON objects, as they would need to create copies or use other methods to manipulate the data.\n\n3. **Standard Library Support**: While Json 11 provides a cleaner interface than some alternatives, it may lack the extensive features and community support found in more established libraries like nlohmann/json. The latter has a more extensive set of features and is widely adopted, which can lead to better documentation and community resources.\n\n4. **Ease of Use**: Json 11's design may not be as user-friendly as other libraries. For instance, nlohmann/json allows for direct mutation of JSON objects, which can simplify the code for developers. Json 11's requirement to create copies for modifications can lead to more complex and less intuitive code.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The error handling capabilities in Json 11 may not be as robust as those in other libraries. Libraries like nlohmann/json provide more comprehensive error reporting and handling mechanisms, which can be crucial for debugging and ensuring data integrity.\n\n6. **Feature Set**: Json 11 may not have as rich a feature set as some of its competitors. For example, libraries like JsonCpp and nlohmann/json offer additional functionalities such as better support for complex data structures and more advanced serialization options.\n\nIn summary, while Json 11 has its strengths, particularly in terms of a clean interface and integration with C++11 features, it faces limitations in performance, ease of use, modification capabilities, and feature richness compared to other JSON libraries in C++. Developers should consider these factors when choosing a JSON library for their projects.
