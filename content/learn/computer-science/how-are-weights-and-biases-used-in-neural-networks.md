    How are weights and biases used in neural networks?
answer: >-
    Weights and biases are fundamental components of neural networks, playing crucial roles in how these models learn from data and make predictions.\n\n1. **Weights**: In a neural network, weights (often denoted as $ w $) represent the strength of the connections between neurons. Each connection between two neurons has an associated weight that determines how much influence the output of one neuron will have on the input of another. When inputs are fed into the network, they are multiplied by these weights, which modulate the signal being passed through the network. This allows the network to learn complex patterns in the data. For example, if a neural network is trained to recognize letters, the weights will adjust to emphasize certain features of the input that are important for distinguishing between different letters.\n\n2. **Biases**: Biases (denoted as $ b $) are additional parameters that are added to the weighted sum of inputs before passing through an activation function. They act as a constant input to the neuron, allowing the model to shift the activation function to better fit the data. This is particularly important because it enables the network to make predictions even when all input features are zero. Biases help the model to learn more effectively by providing it with the flexibility to adjust the output independently of the input values.\n\n3. **Training and Optimization**: During the training process, optimization algorithms such as gradient descent are used to adjust both weights and biases. The goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. By iteratively updating the weights and biases based on the gradients of the loss function, the neural network learns to improve its predictions over time.\n\n4. **Generalization**: Properly tuned weights and biases are essential for a neural network's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. If the weights and biases are not well-optimized, the model may either overfit (perform well on training data but poorly on new data) or underfit (fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data).\n\nIn summary, weights and biases are critical for the functioning of neural networks, enabling them to learn from data, adapt to new information, and make accurate predictions. Understanding their roles is essential for anyone working with neural networks and deep learning.
