    How do you encrypt plaintext passwords on a router?
answer: >-
    To encrypt plaintext passwords on a router, you can use the following command in the router's configuration mode:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter(config)# service password encryption\n```\n\nThis command enables the encryption of all plaintext passwords stored in the router's configuration file, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized users from viewing sensitive password information.\n\n### Steps to Encrypt Passwords on a Router:\n\n1. **Access the Router**: Connect to your router using a console cable or SSH/Telnet.\n2. **Enter Global Configuration Mode**: After logging in, enter privileged EXEC mode by typing `enable`, and then enter global configuration mode with the command:\n   ```plaintext\n   Router# configure terminal\n   ```\n3. **Enable Password Encryption**: Use the command mentioned above to encrypt passwords:\n   ```plaintext\n   Router(config)# service password encryption\n   ```\n4. **Set Passwords**: Configure your passwords for console, VTY, and enable mode as needed. For example:\n   ```plaintext\n   Router(config)# line console 0\n   Router(config-line)# password your_console_password\n   Router(config-line)# login\n   Router(config-line)# exit\n   Router(config)# line vty 0 4\n   Router(config-line)# password your_vty_password\n   Router(config-line)# login\n   Router(config-line)# exit\n   Router(config)# enable secret your_enable_password\n   ```\n5. **Save Configuration**: Finally, save your configuration to ensure that the changes persist after a reboot:\n   ```plaintext\n   Router# copy running-config startup-config\n   ```\n\n### Important Notes:\n- The `service password encryption` command does not provide strong encryption; it uses a reversible algorithm. For better security, consider using more secure methods such as SSH for remote access and using strong passwords.\n- Always ensure that your router's firmware is up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively encrypt plaintext passwords on your router, thereby enhancing the security of your network configuration.
