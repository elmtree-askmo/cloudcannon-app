    What are the data augmentation strategies used in Astraea to handle imbalanced data?
answer: >-
    In the Astraea framework, which is designed to address the challenges of imbalanced data in federated learning (FL), two primary data augmentation strategies are employed:\n\n1. **Global Data Distribution-Based Data Augmentation**: This strategy focuses on augmenting the data based on the overall distribution of data across all clients. By analyzing the global data distribution, Astraea can generate additional samples that help to balance the representation of different classes, thereby alleviating the global imbalance present in the training data.\n\n2. **Z-Score-Based Data Augmentation**: This method involves using Z-scores to identify and augment underrepresented classes in the dataset. By applying statistical techniques, Astraea can create synthetic data points that are statistically similar to the minority class samples, thus enhancing their representation in the training process.\n\nThese strategies are complemented by a mediator-based multi-client rescheduling approach, which adjusts the training schedule of clients based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of their data distributions. This ensures that clients with more imbalanced data distributions are given appropriate attention during the training process, further mitigating the effects of data imbalance.\n\nOverall, Astraea's combination of global data distribution-based augmentation and Z-score-based augmentation, along with its innovative rescheduling mechanism, aims to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of federated learning in scenarios where data is imbalanced.
