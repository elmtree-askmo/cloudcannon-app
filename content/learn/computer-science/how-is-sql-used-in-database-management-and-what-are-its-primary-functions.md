    How is SQL used in database management, and what are its primary functions?
answer: >-
    SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It plays a crucial role in database management by providing a means to interact with the data stored in a database. Here are the primary functions of SQL in database management:\n\n1. **Data Retrieval**: The most common use of SQL is to retrieve data from a database. This is accomplished using the `SELECT` statement, which allows users to specify which columns to return and to filter, sort, and group the results. For example, to select all records from a table named 'employees', you would use:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM employees;\n   ```\n\n2. **Data Insertion**: SQL allows users to add new records to a database table using the `INSERT` command. This is essential for populating the database with initial data or appending additional data as needed. An example of an `INSERT` statement is:\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Developer', 60000);\n   ```\n\n3. **Data Update**: The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing records in a database. This function is vital for maintaining accurate and up-to-date information. For instance, to update the salary of an employee, you might use:\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE name = 'John Doe';\n   ```\n\n4. **Data Deletion**: SQL provides the `DELETE` command to remove records from a database table. This is important for data management and ensuring that outdated or incorrect information is eliminated. An example of a `DELETE` statement is:\n   ```sql\n   DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';\n   ```\n\n5. **Database Structure Management**: SQL also includes commands for managing the structure of the database itself, such as creating and modifying tables. The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to define a new table, while `ALTER TABLE` can be used to modify an existing table. For example:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE employees (\n       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n       name VARCHAR(100),\n       position VARCHAR(50),\n       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n   );\n   ```\n\n6. **Data Control**: SQL includes Data Control Language (DCL) commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, which are used to manage permissions and access control for users interacting with the database.\n\nIn summary, SQL is integral to database management, enabling users to efficiently store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage data. Its capabilities ensure that users can quickly and accurately access the information they need for decision-making and analysis.
