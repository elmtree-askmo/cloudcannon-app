    How do denial of service (DoS) attacks disrupt network availability?
answer: >-
    Denial of Service (DoS) attacks disrupt network availability by overwhelming a targeted server, service, or network with a flood of illegitimate requests. The primary goal of these attacks is to render the system unavailable to legitimate users, leading to significant downtime and loss of service. \n\nWhen a DoS attack occurs, the targeted system's resources—such as bandwidth, memory, or processing power—are consumed by the excessive traffic generated by the attacker. This can result in the system becoming slow, unresponsive, or completely inaccessible. For instance, in the case of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, multiple compromised systems (often part of a botnet) are used to generate a massive volume of traffic, further exacerbating the impact on the target.\n\nThe effects of DoS attacks can extend beyond immediate service disruptions. They can lead to cascading failures in interconnected systems and infrastructure components. For example, if a DoS attack targets a network's control plane or management interfaces, it can hinder the deployment of routing updates and configuration changes, thereby destabilizing the entire network.\n\nIn summary, DoS attacks disrupt network availability by overwhelming resources, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users and potentially causing broader impacts on network performance and reliability.
