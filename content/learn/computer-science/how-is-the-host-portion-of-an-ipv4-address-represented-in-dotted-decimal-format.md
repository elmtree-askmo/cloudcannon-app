    How is the host portion of an IPv4 address represented in dotted decimal format?
answer: >-
    The host portion of an IPv4 address is represented in dotted decimal format as part of the overall structure of the address. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number divided into four octets, each consisting of 8 bits. These octets are typically expressed in decimal form and separated by dots, resulting in the familiar dotted decimal notation.\n\nFor example, consider the IPv4 address `192.168.1.10`. In this address:\n\n- The first three octets (`192.168.1`) represent the network portion.\n- The last octet (`10`) represents the host portion.\n\nTo determine which part of the address is the host portion, a subnet mask is used. The subnet mask indicates which bits of the address are used for the network and which are used for the host. For instance, with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, the first three octets are designated for the network, and the last octet is reserved for host addresses within that network.\n\nIn summary, the host portion of an IPv4 address in dotted decimal format is the last segment of the address, which identifies a specific device within the network defined by the preceding segments.
