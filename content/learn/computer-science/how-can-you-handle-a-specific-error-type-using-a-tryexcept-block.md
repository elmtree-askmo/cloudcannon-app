    How can you handle a specific error type using a try...except block?
answer: >-
    To handle a specific error type using a `try...except` block in Python, you can specify the type of exception you want to catch in the `except` clause. This allows you to manage different types of errors in a controlled manner. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Basic Structure**: You place the code that might raise an exception inside the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the control is transferred to the corresponding `except` block.\n\n2. **Catching Specific Exceptions**: You can catch specific exceptions by naming them in the `except` clause. This is useful when you want to handle different exceptions differently.\n\nHere’s an example that demonstrates how to handle a specific error type, such as `ValueError`:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    value = int(input('Enter a number: '))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print('Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.')\n```\n\nIn this example, if the user inputs something that cannot be converted to an integer (like a string), a `ValueError` will be raised, and the message "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number." will be printed.\n\nAnother example involves handling a mathematical error, such as trying to compute the square root of a negative number, which raises a `ValueError`:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ntry:\n    result = math.sqrt(-4)  # This will raise a ValueError\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print("Error:", e)  # Output: Error: math domain error\n```\n\nIn this case, if the square root function is called with a negative number, the `ValueError` is caught, and the error message is printed, allowing the program to continue running without crashing.\n\nBy using specific exception types in your `except` clauses, you can create more robust and user-friendly applications that handle errors gracefully.
