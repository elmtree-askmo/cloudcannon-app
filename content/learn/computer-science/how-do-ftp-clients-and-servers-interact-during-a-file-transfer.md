    How do FTP clients and servers interact during a file transfer?
answer: >-
    FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a TCP-based network. The interaction between FTP clients and servers during a file transfer involves several key steps and utilizes two separate connections: one for control commands and another for data transfer.\n\n### Interaction Steps\n\n1. **Connection Establishment**:\n   - The FTP client initiates a connection to the FTP server by connecting to TCP port 21, which is designated for control commands. This connection is used to send commands from the client to the server and receive responses.\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - Once the control connection is established, the client typically sends authentication credentials (username and password) to the server. The server verifies these credentials to allow access.\n\n3. **Command Execution**:\n   - After successful authentication, the client can issue various commands to the server, such as:\n     - `LIST`: To list files and directories.\n     - `RETR`: To retrieve (download) a file from the server.\n     - `STOR`: To store (upload) a file to the server.\n   - The server processes these commands and sends back appropriate responses.\n\n4. **Data Connection Establishment**:\n   - For file transfers, a separate data connection is established. This can be done in two modes:\n     - **Active Mode**: The server connects back to the client on a specified port for data transfer.\n     - **Passive Mode**: The client requests the server to open a port for the data connection, and the client connects to that port. This mode is often used to navigate firewall restrictions.\n\n5. **File Transfer**:\n   - Once the data connection is established, the actual file transfer occurs. The client can download files from the server or upload files to the server. The data transfer uses TCP port 20.\n\n6. **Connection Termination**:\n   - After the file transfer is complete, the client can close the data connection. The control connection can remain open for further commands or can be closed as well.\n\n### Summary of Ports Used\n- **Control Connection**: TCP port 21\n- **Data Connection**: TCP port 20 (for active mode) or a dynamically assigned port (for passive mode)\n\n### Conclusion\nFTP clients and servers interact through a structured process involving command and data connections, allowing for efficient file transfers. This protocol is essential for tasks such as website management and data sharing, making it a fundamental tool in network communications.
