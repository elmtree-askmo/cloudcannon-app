    What is the difference between directed and undirected networks?
answer: >-
    In network analysis, the distinction between directed and undirected networks is fundamental and relates to how connections between nodes (or vertices) are represented.\n\n1. **Directed Networks**: In a directed network, the connections between nodes have a specific direction. This means that an edge (connection) from node A to node B is not the same as an edge from node B to node A. For example, in a Twitter network, if user Smith follows user Jones, this relationship is directional; it does not imply that Jones follows Smith back. Each directed relationship is represented with an arrow indicating the direction of the connection. Directed networks are often used to model relationships where the direction is significant, such as following relationships on social media or citation networks in academic research.\n\n2. **Undirected Networks**: In contrast, undirected networks have connections that are non-directional. This means that if there is an edge between node A and node B, it implies a mutual relationship; both nodes are connected without any directionality. For instance, in a social network like Facebook, friendships are typically represented as undirected edges, meaning if person A is friends with person B, then person B is also friends with person A. In undirected networks, the edges do not have arrows, and the relationships are interchangeable.\n\n3. **Key Differences**:\n   - **Edge Directionality**: Directed networks have edges with a specific direction, while undirected networks do not.\n   - **Interpretation of Relationships**: In directed networks, the relationship is one-way, whereas in undirected networks, the relationship is mutual.\n   - **Connectivity**: The definition of connectivity differs; in undirected networks, if there is a path between any two vertices, they are considered connected, while in directed networks, the path must follow the direction of the edges.\n\nThese differences are crucial for understanding the structure and dynamics of various types of networks, especially in social network analysis, where the nature of relationships can significantly impact the behavior and influence within the network.
