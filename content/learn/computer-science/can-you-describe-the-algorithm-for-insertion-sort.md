answer: >-
    Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It is particularly effective for small datasets or partially sorted arrays. The algorithm works by iteratively taking an unsorted element (referred to as the "key") and inserting it into its correct position within a sorted portion of the array.\n\n### Algorithm Steps:\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the second element of the array (index 1), as the first element (index 0) is considered sorted.\n2. **Iteration**: For each element in the array from the second element to the last:\n   - Store the current element as the "key".\n   - Compare the key with the elements in the sorted portion of the array (to its left).\n   - Shift all elements that are greater than the key to the right to make space for the key.\n   - Insert the key into its correct position in the sorted portion.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Pseudocode:\nHere is a simple pseudocode representation of the Insertion Sort algorithm:\n\n```\nfor i from 1 to length(arr) - 1:\n    key = arr[i]\n    j = i - 1\n    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n        arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n        j = j - 1\n    arr[j + 1] = key\n```\n\n### Python Implementation:\nBelow is a Python implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    """Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm."""\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: The average and worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. However, the best-case time complexity is $O(n)$, which occurs when the array is already sorted.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is $O(1)$, as it requires a constant amount of additional space.\n\n### Practical Applications:\nInsertion Sort is often used in practice for small datasets or as part of more complex algorithms, such as Timsort, which is used in Python's built-in sort functions. It is also useful in scenarios where data is continuously being added to a sorted list, as it can efficiently insert new elements.\n\nOverall, Insertion Sort is a straightforward algorithm that is easy to implement and understand, making it a great choice for educational purposes and specific practical applications.
