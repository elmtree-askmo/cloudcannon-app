    How do you declare and initialize an integer array in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, you can declare and initialize an integer array in several ways. Here are the most common methods:\n\n1. **Declaring and Initializing with a Fixed Size**:\n   You can declare an array and specify its size at the same time. For example, to create an integer array that can hold 10 elements, you would write:\n   ```java\n   int[] arr = new int[10];\n   ```\n   In this case, `arr` is an array that can hold 10 integers, and all elements are initialized to 0 by default.\n\n2. **Declaring and Initializing with Values**:\n   You can also declare an array and initialize it with specific values in a single step. For example:\n   ```java\n   int[] age = {12, 4, 5, 2, 5};\n   ```\n   Here, the array `age` is created with 5 elements, and the size is automatically determined by the number of values provided.\n\n3. **Using a Variable for Size**:\n   If you want to specify the size of the array using a variable, you can do so like this:\n   ```java\n   int length = 5;\n   int[] numbers = new int[length];\n   ```\n   This creates an integer array `numbers` with a size defined by the variable `length`.\n\n4. **Multidimensional Arrays**:\n   For multidimensional arrays, you can declare and initialize them similarly. For example, to create a two-dimensional array with 10 rows and 17 columns:\n   ```java\n   int[][] matrix = new int[10][17];\n   ```\n   This creates a two-dimensional array that can hold 170 integers (10 rows Ã— 17 columns).\n\n5. **Using the `Arrays.fill` Method**:\n   You can also initialize an array with a specific value using the `Arrays.fill` method:\n   ```java\n   int[] myArray = new int[5];\n   Arrays.fill(myArray, 1);\n   ```\n   This initializes all elements of `myArray` to 1.\n\nThese methods provide flexibility in how you can declare and initialize arrays in Java, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your needs.
