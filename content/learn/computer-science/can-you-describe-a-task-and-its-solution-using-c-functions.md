    Can you describe a task and its solution using C++ functions?
answer: >-
    Certainly! Let's describe a practical programming task using C++ functions, specifically focusing on calculating the square of a number and then doubling that result.\n\n### Task: Implement a Function to Calculate the Square and Double It\n\n**Objective:** Create a program that defines a function to calculate the square of a number and another function that uses this square function to double the result. Finally, call this function from the `main` function and print the result.\n\n### Solution\n\nHereâ€™s how you can implement this in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to calculate the square of a number\nint square(int num) {\n    return num * num;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the square and then double it\nint squareAndDouble(int num) {\n    return 2 * square(num);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n\n    // Asking user for input\n    cout << "Enter a number: ";\n    cin >> number;\n\n    // Calling the squareAndDouble function and printing the result\n    int result = squareAndDouble(number);\n    cout << "The double of the square of " << number << " is: " << result << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Function Definitions:**\n   - `square(int num)`: This function takes an integer as input and returns its square.\n   - `squareAndDouble(int num)`: This function calls the `square` function to get the square of the number and then doubles that value.\n\n2. **Main Function:**\n   - The program prompts the user to enter a number.\n   - It then calls the `squareAndDouble` function with the user-provided number and stores the result.\n   - Finally, it prints the result to the console.\n\n### Benefits of Using Functions:\n- **Code Reusability:** The `square` function can be reused in other parts of the program or in different programs without rewriting the logic.\n- **Modularity:** The program is easier to read and maintain because the logic is broken down into smaller, manageable parts.\n- **Clarity:** Each function has a clear purpose, making the code easier to understand.\n\nThis example illustrates how user-defined functions in C++ can simplify complex tasks and enhance code organization.
