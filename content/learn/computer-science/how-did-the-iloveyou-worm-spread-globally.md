    How did the ILOVEYOU worm spread globally?
answer: >-
    The ILOVEYOU worm, also known as the Love Bug, spread globally starting on May 5, 2000, primarily through email. It was designed to appear as a love letter, with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and an attachment named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs." At that time, many Windows operating systems hid file extensions, which led users to believe they were opening a harmless text file rather than a potentially harmful script.\n\nOnce a recipient opened the attachment, the Visual Basic Script (VBS) embedded in the file executed, allowing the worm to access the Microsoft Outlook address book. It then iterated through all contacts, sending copies of itself to each one, which facilitated its rapid spread across North America, Europe, and Asia. Within just a day, the worm had infected millions of computers, causing significant disruptions to various organizations, including major corporations like Ford Motor Company and AT&T, as well as government entities like the Pentagon.\n\nThe ILOVEYOU worm is notable not only for its widespread impact—infecting over ten million computers and causing an estimated $10 billion in damages—but also for highlighting the vulnerabilities associated with social engineering tactics in cybersecurity. It marked a pivotal moment in the history of cyber threats, demonstrating how a simple piece of code could lead to extensive chaos and reshaping the landscape of cybersecurity practices.
