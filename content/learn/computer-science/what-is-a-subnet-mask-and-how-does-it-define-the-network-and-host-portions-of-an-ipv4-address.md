    What is a subnet mask, and how does it define the network and host portions of an IPv4 address?
answer: >-
    A subnet mask is a 32-bit pattern used in IPv4 addressing to define the boundary between the network portion and the host portion of an IP address. It does not contain the actual network or host information; instead, it indicates where to look for these portions within a given IPv4 address.\n\n### Structure of a Subnet Mask\nThe subnet mask is represented in binary as a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. The 1s in the subnet mask correspond to the bits that represent the network portion of the IP address, while the 0s correspond to the bits that represent the host portion. The transition from 1s to 0s in the subnet mask indicates the division between the network and host portions.\n\nFor example, consider the following IPv4 address and subnet mask:\n\n- **IPv4 Address**: 10.20.30.40\n- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)\n\nIn binary, this would be represented as:\n\n- **IPv4 Address**: \n  ```\n  00001010.00010100.00011110.00101000\n  ```\n- **Subnet Mask**: \n  ```\n  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n  ```\n\n### Network and Host Portions\nIn the example above, the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 indicates that the first 24 bits (the 1s in the subnet mask) are used for the network portion, while the remaining 8 bits (the 0s) are used for the host portion. Therefore:\n\n- **Network Portion**: 10.20.30.0 (the first 24 bits)\n- **Host Portion**: 0.0.0.40 (the last 8 bits)\n\nThis means that within the network defined by 10.20.30.0/24, there can be 256 possible addresses (from 10.20.30.0 to 10.20.30.255), but only 254 usable host addresses (10.20.30.1 to 10.20.30.254), as the first address is reserved for the network and the last for the broadcast address.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the subnet mask is crucial for determining how an IPv4 address is divided into network and host portions. It allows devices on a network to identify which part of the address is used for routing packets to the correct network and which part is used to identify individual devices within that network.
