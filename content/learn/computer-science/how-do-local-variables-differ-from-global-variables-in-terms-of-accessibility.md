    How do local variables differ from global variables in terms of accessibility?
answer: >-
    Local variables and global variables differ significantly in terms of accessibility within a Python program.\n\n1. **Local Variables**:\n   - Local variables are defined within a function and can only be accessed from within that function. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits. This means that their scope is limited to the function in which they are defined.\n   - For example:\n   ```python\n   def my_function():\n       local_var = 5  # Local variable\n       print(local_var)  # Accessible within the function\n\n   my_function()\n   # print(local_var)  # This would raise an error because local_var is not accessible here\n   ```\n\n2. **Global Variables**:\n   - Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including inside functions. They maintain their value throughout the program's execution.\n   - For example:\n   ```python\n   global_var = 10  # Global variable\n\n   def my_function():\n       print(global_var)  # Accessible within the function\n\n   my_function()\n   print(global_var)  # Accessible outside the function\n   ```\n\nIn summary, local variables are restricted to the function they are defined in, while global variables can be accessed from any part of the program. This distinction is crucial for managing variable scope and avoiding potential conflicts in larger programs.
