    Can you provide a simple example using the pack() method?
answer: >-
    Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple example of using the `pack()` method in Tkinter to create a basic GUI application with three labels, each having a different background color:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title("Pack Example")\n\n# Create three labels with different background colors\nlabel1 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 1", bg="red", fg="white")\nlabel2 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 2", bg="green", fg="white")\nlabel3 = tk.Label(root, text="Label 3", bg="blue", fg="white")\n\n# Pack the labels into the window\nlabel1.pack(pady=10)  # Add some vertical padding\nlabel2.pack(pady=10)\nlabel3.pack(pady=10)\n\n# Start the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Creating the Main Window**: The `Tk()` function initializes the main window.\n- **Creating Labels**: Three labels are created with different background colors and text.\n- **Packing the Labels**: The `pack()` method is used to add the labels to the window. The `pady` option adds vertical padding between the labels for better spacing.\n- **Event Loop**: `mainloop()` keeps the window open and responsive to user interactions.\n\nThis example demonstrates how the `pack()` method organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget, making it a straightforward choice for simple layouts.
