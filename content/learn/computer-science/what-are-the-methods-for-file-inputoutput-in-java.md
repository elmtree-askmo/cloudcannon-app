    What are the methods for file input/output in Java?
answer: >-
    In Java, file input/output (I/O) operations can be performed using various classes and methods provided in the Java I/O API. Here are the primary methods and classes used for file I/O in Java:\n\n1. **Byte Streams**: These are used for reading and writing binary data. The main classes include:\n   - `FileInputStream`: Used to read bytes from a file.\n   - `FileOutputStream`: Used to write bytes to a file.\n\n   Example of reading from a file using `FileInputStream`:\n   ```java\n   FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("example.txt");\n   int data;\n   while ((data = fis.read()) != -1) {\n       System.out.print((char) data);\n   }\n   fis.close();\n   ```\n\n2. **Character Streams**: These are used for reading and writing character data. The main classes include:\n   - `FileReader`: Used to read characters from a file.\n   - `FileWriter`: Used to write characters to a file.\n   - `BufferedReader`: Used to read text from a character input stream efficiently.\n   - `BufferedWriter`: Used to write text to a character output stream efficiently.\n\n   Example of writing to a file using `FileWriter`:\n   ```java\n   FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("example.txt");\n   fw.write("Hello, World!");\n   fw.close();\n   ```\n\n3. **NIO (New Input/Output)**: Introduced in Java 7, the `java.nio.file` package provides a more flexible and efficient way to handle file I/O. Key classes include:\n   - `Files`: Contains static methods for file operations such as reading, writing, copying, and deleting files.\n   - `Paths`: Used to create `Path` objects that represent file and directory paths.\n\n   Example of reading a file line by line using `Files.lines`:\n   ```java\n   Path path = Paths.get("example.txt");\n   try (Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path)) {\n       lines.forEach(System.out::println);\n   } catch (IOException e) {\n       e.printStackTrace();\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Scanner**: This class can also be used for reading input from files, providing a simple way to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions.\n\n   Example of using `Scanner` to read from a file:\n   ```java\n   File file = new File("example.txt");\n   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n   while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n       System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());\n   }\n   scanner.close();\n   ```\n\nThese methods and classes provide a comprehensive set of tools for performing file I/O operations in Java, allowing developers to handle both binary and character data efficiently.
