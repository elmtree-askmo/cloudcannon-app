    How do Class A, B, and C IPv4 addresses differ in terms of network and host portions?
answer: >-
    Class A, B, and C IPv4 addresses differ primarily in their network and host portions, which are determined by their fixed prefix lengths. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Class A\n- **Address Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0\n- **Prefix Length**: /8\n- **Network Portion**: The first octet (8 bits) represents the network.\n- **Host Portion**: The remaining three octets (24 bits) represent the hosts.\n- **Total Addresses**: Approximately 16 million addresses per Class A network (2^24 - 2 for network and broadcast addresses).\n\n### Class B\n- **Address Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255\n- **Prefix Length**: /16\n- **Network Portion**: The first two octets (16 bits) represent the network.\n- **Host Portion**: The remaining two octets (16 bits) represent the hosts.\n- **Total Addresses**: Approximately 65,534 addresses per Class B network (2^16 - 2 for network and broadcast addresses).\n\n### Class C\n- **Address Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255\n- **Prefix Length**: /24\n- **Network Portion**: The first three octets (24 bits) represent the network.\n- **Host Portion**: The last octet (8 bits) represents the hosts.\n- **Total Addresses**: 254 addresses per Class C network (2^8 - 2 for network and broadcast addresses).\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Network Portion**: In Class A, the network portion is 8 bits; in Class B, it is 16 bits; and in Class C, it is 24 bits.\n- **Host Portion**: Consequently, the host portion increases from 24 bits in Class A to 16 bits in Class B, and finally to 8 bits in Class C.\n- **Address Capacity**: Class A can support the largest number of hosts, followed by Class B, and then Class C, which is designed for smaller networks.\n\nThis classful addressing scheme has limitations, such as inefficient use of address space, which led to the development of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for more flexible address allocation.
