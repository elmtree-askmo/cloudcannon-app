answer: >-
    To conduct a review session on the topics of Data Structures and Algorithms, including Recursive Data Structures, Tree Terminology and Traversal Methods, Binary Search Trees, Graphs and Graph Traversal Methods, Nearest Neighbor Problem, and KD Trees, the following instructions can be followed:\n\n1. **Schedule and Format**: \n   - The review sessions will be held on Fridays from 9:00 am to 10:30 am via Zoom. Ensure that all participants have access to the Zoom link provided by the instructor.\n\n2. **Preparation**:\n   - Encourage participants to review relevant materials prior to the session. This may include textbooks such as "Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS), and any lecture notes or resources provided during the course.\n   - Participants should come prepared with specific questions or topics they find challenging.\n\n3. **Session Structure**:\n   - Start with a brief overview of the key concepts related to the topics. This could include definitions and examples of data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs) and algorithms (like sorting, searching, and recursion).\n   - Allocate time for each major topic:\n     - **Recursive Data Structures**: Discuss the principles of recursion and how it applies to data structures.\n     - **Tree Terminology and Traversal Methods**: Explain different types of trees (binary trees, binary search trees, etc.) and traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).\n     - **Binary Search Trees**: Cover properties, operations (insertion, deletion, searching), and balancing techniques.\n     - **Graphs and Graph Traversal Methods**: Discuss graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and traversal algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search).\n     - **Nearest Neighbor Problem and KD Trees**: Explain the concept of nearest neighbor search and how KD trees are used for efficient searching in multidimensional spaces.\n\n4. **Interactive Component**:\n   - Encourage participants to engage in discussions, ask questions, and solve problems collaboratively. This could involve working through example problems or coding exercises related to the topics.\n   - Consider using a timer for mock interviews or coding challenges to simulate exam conditions.\n\n5. **Feedback and Follow-Up**:\n   - At the end of the session, gather feedback from participants on what topics they found most helpful and what areas they would like to focus on in future sessions.\n   - Provide additional resources or reading materials for participants to explore after the session.\n\nBy following these instructions, the review session can be structured effectively to enhance understanding and retention of the material covered in the Data Structures and Algorithms portion of the Masters Comprehensive Exam.
