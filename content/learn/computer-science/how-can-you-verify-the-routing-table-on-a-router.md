answer: >-
    To verify the routing table on a router, you can use specific commands in the Command Line Interface (CLI). The most common command to display the IPv4 routing table is:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter# show ip route\n```\n\nThis command provides a detailed view of the routing table, including the sources of routes such as directly connected networks, static routes, and dynamically learned routes. Each entry in the routing table helps the router make informed forwarding decisions based on the destination IP address of incoming packets.\n\nFor IPv6 routing tables, you can use the following command:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter# show ipv6 route\n```\n\nIn addition to checking the routing table, you may also want to verify the status of the router interfaces. The command for this is:\n\n```plaintext\nRouter# show ip interface brief\n```\n\nThis command gives a summary of all interfaces on the router, including their IP addresses and operational status, which is crucial for ensuring that the interfaces are correctly configured and active.\n\nOverall, these commands are essential for network management and troubleshooting, allowing you to confirm that the routing configurations are functioning as intended.
