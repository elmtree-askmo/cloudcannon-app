    How do quantum bits differ from classical bits?
answer: >-
    Quantum bits, or qubits, differ significantly from classical bits in several fundamental ways, primarily due to the principles of quantum mechanics. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **State Representation**: Classical bits can exist in one of two distinct states: 0 or 1. In contrast, qubits can exist in a state of 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states. This means that a qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing for a much richer set of possibilities.\n\n2. **Superposition**: The ability of qubits to be in superposition is a crucial feature that enables quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. For example, while two classical bits can represent four combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), two qubits can represent all four combinations simultaneously due to superposition.\n\n3. **Entanglement**: Qubits can also be entangled, a phenomenon where the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. This entanglement allows for complex correlations between qubits that classical bits cannot achieve, enabling more powerful computational capabilities.\n\n4. **Parallelism**: Because of superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can process a vast amount of information simultaneously. This parallelism allows quantum algorithms to solve certain problems much faster than classical algorithms, which must process each combination sequentially.\n\n5. **Measurement**: When a qubit is measured, it collapses from its superposition state to one of the definite states (0 or 1). This is different from classical bits, which are always in a definite state until changed.\n\nIn summary, qubits leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to provide computational capabilities that far exceed those of classical bits, making quantum computing a revolutionary advancement in information processing.
