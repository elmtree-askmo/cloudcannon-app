    What functionalities does a web server provide in a network?
answer: >-
    A web server provides several key functionalities in a network, primarily focused on delivering web content to clients over the internet. Here are the main functionalities:\n\n1. **Content Delivery**: A web server stores, processes, and serves various types of web content, including HTML pages, images, videos, and other multimedia files. When a client (typically a web browser) requests a specific resource, the web server retrieves the requested content and sends it back to the client.\n\n2. **Request Handling**: The web server accepts requests from clients and responds accordingly. It processes incoming HTTP requests, determines the appropriate action (such as serving a static file or executing a script), and sends back the corresponding HTTP response.\n\n3. **Static and Dynamic Content Serving**: Web servers can serve both static and dynamic content. Static content remains unchanged until modified, while dynamic content is generated in real-time based on user requests or interactions. For dynamic content, the web server may interact with application servers or databases to generate the appropriate response.\n\n4. **URL Redirection**: Web servers can implement URL redirection, which instructs clients to access a different URL. This is useful for reorganizing content or ensuring that users are directed to the correct resource.\n\n5. **Access Control**: Many web servers include features for managing access rights. They can verify whether a user has the necessary permissions to access certain resources and can deny access if the user does not meet the required criteria.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: Web servers are responsible for handling errors that occur during the request process. They can return specific HTTP status codes (like 404 for "Not Found" or 500 for "Internal Server Error") to inform clients about the nature of the issue.\n\n7. **Security Features**: Web servers often include security measures such as SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission, authentication mechanisms to verify user identities, and logging capabilities to track access and usage patterns.\n\n8. **Load Balancing and Scalability**: To manage high traffic volumes, web servers can implement load balancing techniques, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability.\n\n9. **Integration with Other Services**: Web servers can work in conjunction with other network services, such as database management systems, email servers, and application servers, to provide a comprehensive web experience.\n\n10. **Support for Protocols**: Web servers support various protocols, primarily HTTP and HTTPS, which are essential for web communication. They may also support other protocols like FTP for file transfers.\n\nIn summary, a web server is a crucial component of the internet infrastructure, enabling the delivery of web content and services to users while managing requests, security, and performance.
