    How does floating-point division differ from integer division in Prolog?
answer: >-
    In Prolog, floating-point division and integer division are handled differently, reflecting the underlying arithmetic types and their behaviors.\n\n1. **Integer Division**: In Prolog, integer division is performed using the `//` operator. This operator divides two integers and rounds the result towards negative infinity. The result is also an integer. For example, if you perform the operation `5 // 2`, the result will be `2`, as it discards the fractional part. The integer division can be defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{Result} = \frac{\text{IntExpr1} - (\text{IntExpr1} \mod \text{IntExpr2})}{\text{IntExpr2}}\n   $$\n   This guarantees that the behavior is consistent with the `mod/2` operation.\n\n2. **Floating-Point Division**: In contrast, floating-point division is performed using the `/` operator. This operator will yield a floating-point result, even if both operands are integers. For instance, `5 / 2` will result in `2.5`. Prolog automatically converts the integers to floating-point numbers when using this operator, which allows for more precise calculations when dealing with non-integer results.\n\n3. **Automatic Type Handling**: SWI-Prolog attempts to abstract away the differences between integer and floating-point arithmetic. It performs integer arithmetic as long as possible and only switches to floating-point arithmetic when necessary (i.e., when one of the operands is a floating-point number or when the operation inherently requires it).\n\n4. **Rational Numbers**: Additionally, Prolog supports rational numbers through functions like `rational/1` and `rdiv/2`. If the Prolog flag `prefer_rationals` is set to true, division will yield a rational number instead of a floating-point number.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the type of result produced: integer division (`//`) yields an integer result, while floating-point division (`/`) yields a floating-point result. This distinction is crucial for numerical manipulation in Prolog, especially when precision and type are important in computations.
