    What are the key differences between image classification, object detection, and image segmentation?
answer: >-
    In the realm of computer vision, image classification, object detection, and image segmentation are three fundamental tasks, each with distinct objectives and methodologies. Here are the key differences among them:\n\n1. **Image Classification**:\n   - **Objective**: The primary goal of image classification is to assign a label to an entire image based on its content. It determines what object or scene is present in the image.\n   - **Output**: The output is a single label (or multiple labels) that represents the most prominent object or scene in the image. For example, an image may be classified as "cat" or "dog."\n   - **Complexity**: This is the simplest task among the three, as it does not require any localization or detailed understanding of the image's content.\n\n2. **Object Detection**:\n   - **Objective**: Object detection extends image classification by not only identifying objects within an image but also locating them. It involves drawing bounding boxes around detected objects and labeling them.\n   - **Output**: The output consists of multiple bounding boxes, each associated with a class label. For instance, an image may contain a bounding box labeled "cat" and another labeled "dog."\n   - **Complexity**: Object detection is more complex than image classification because it requires both classification and localization of multiple objects within the same image.\n\n3. **Image Segmentation**:\n   - **Objective**: Image segmentation takes the task a step further by partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions at the pixel level. It aims to identify the exact outline of each object within the image.\n   - **Output**: The output is a mask that provides pixel-wise details for each object, allowing for a more granular understanding of the image. For example, every pixel belonging to a "cat" would be labeled accordingly, distinguishing it from the background and other objects.\n   - **Complexity**: This is the most complex task among the three, as it requires a detailed understanding of the image's content and the relationships between different objects.\n\nIn summary, the progression from image classification to object detection and then to image segmentation reflects an increasing level of detail and complexity in understanding visual data. Image classification provides a broad label, object detection adds localization, and image segmentation offers precise pixel-level information.
