    What is a visual check in data verification and how is it performed?
answer: >-
    A visual check in data verification is a fundamental method that involves a manual review of data entries to ensure their accuracy. This process is typically performed by a user who compares the newly inputted data against the original source documents. The primary purpose of a visual check is to confirm that the data entered into a system matches the data from the source, thereby maintaining data integrity.\n\n### How Visual Checks are Performed:\n\n1. **Manual Comparison**: The user reads the data from the original document (such as a paper form or a digital file) and compares it line by line with the data that has been entered into the system. This can involve checking for typographical errors, missing entries, or incorrect values.\n\n2. **Proofreading**: The user may also proofread the data to ensure that it is not only identical to the source but also formatted correctly. This includes checking for proper capitalization, punctuation, and adherence to any specific formatting guidelines.\n\n3. **Focus on Accuracy**: The visual check is primarily concerned with verifying that the data is accurate and in its original form as expected. It does not assess whether the data makes sense or falls within acceptable boundaries; that is the role of data validation.\n\n4. **Documentation**: In some cases, the user may document any discrepancies found during the visual check for further review or correction.\n\n### Limitations:\nWhile visual checks are effective in identifying errors, they are not foolproof. They rely heavily on the attention and accuracy of the person performing the check, which can lead to human error. Therefore, visual checks are often used in conjunction with other verification methods, such as double data entry, to enhance overall data accuracy.\n\nIn summary, a visual check is a straightforward yet essential technique in the data verification process, ensuring that the data entered into a system is accurate and consistent with the original source.
