    The convergence analysis for the FedProx framework addresses the challenges posed by heterogeneity in federated learning environments. FedProx is designed as a generalization of the FedAvg algorithm, specifically to enhance robustness and stability during convergence in networks with non-identical data distributions.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Convergence Analysis:\n\n1. **Device Dissimilarity Assumption**: The analysis introduces a device dissimilarity assumption, which characterizes the heterogeneity present in the federated network. This assumption is crucial for deriving convergence guarantees, as it allows the framework to account for variations in data distribution across different devices.\n\n2. **Convergence Guarantees**: The theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for the FedProx algorithm, particularly for smooth and non-convex optimization problems. The results indicate that the rate of convergence to a stationary point is upper bounded by a specific expression, which includes terms that reflect the expected gradient norms over iterations. Specifically, the convergence rate is shown to be upper bounded by:\n\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} E \left[ \| \nabla R(w_t) \|^2 \right] \max \left( \frac{1}{T^{2/3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{TI}} \right)\n   $$\n\n   This formulation highlights the relationship between the number of iterations \(T\) and the convergence behavior, indicating that the convergence can be influenced by the size of the minibatch and the number of sampled devices.\n\n3. **Invariance to Local Dissimilarity Conditions**: One of the significant contributions of the FedProx framework is its ability to provide convergence guarantees that are invariant to certain stringent local dissimilarity conditions. This means that the framework can maintain convergence properties even when the local data distributions vary significantly among devices.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation**: The theoretical findings are supported by extensive empirical evaluations conducted on both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. These evaluations demonstrate that FedProx not only adheres to the theoretical convergence guarantees but also exhibits improved robustness and stability compared to FedAvg in heterogeneous settings.\n\n5. **Insights into Non-Convex Problems**: The analysis also extends to non-smooth federated learning problems, providing insights into how FedProx can effectively handle such scenarios while ensuring convergence.\n\nIn summary, the convergence analysis of the FedProx framework establishes a solid theoretical foundation for its application in heterogeneous federated learning environments, offering guarantees that enhance its practical utility in real-world scenarios.
