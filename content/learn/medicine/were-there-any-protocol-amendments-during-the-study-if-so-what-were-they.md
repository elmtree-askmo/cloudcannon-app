    Were there any protocol amendments during the study? If so, what were they?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, there is no specific mention of any protocol amendments during the study. However, it is noted that any study protocol amendments would require re-approval by the CIRB (Central Institutional Review Board), and all investigators would be informed of such amendments. This implies that while amendments could occur, the details of any specific amendments are not provided in the available information.\n\nIf you need more detailed information regarding specific amendments or changes made during the study, it may be necessary to consult the study's official documentation or publications that detail the study protocol and any subsequent changes.
