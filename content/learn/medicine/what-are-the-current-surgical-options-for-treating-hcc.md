    What are the current surgical options for treating HCC?
answer: >-
    The current surgical options for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) primarily include:\n\n1. **Surgical Resection**: This is often the preferred treatment for patients with HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver or in those with limited cirrhosis and preserved liver function. Surgical resection involves the removal of the tumor along with a margin of healthy liver tissue. The decision to proceed with resection is based on a comprehensive evaluation of liver function and tumor characteristics.\n\n2. **Liver Transplantation**: For patients with early-stage HCC who are not suitable candidates for resection due to underlying liver disease or poor liver function, liver transplantation can be a curative option. This approach not only removes the tumor but also addresses the underlying liver disease, which is often a significant factor in HCC patients.\n\n3. **Ablation Techniques**: These include methods such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation, which are minimally invasive procedures used to destroy cancer cells. Ablation is typically indicated for small tumors (usually less than 3 cm) and can be an option for patients who are not candidates for surgery or transplantation.\n\n4. **Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)**: While not strictly a surgical procedure, TACE is often used in conjunction with surgical options. It involves delivering chemotherapy directly to the blood vessels feeding the tumor, combined with embolic agents to block blood flow, thereby starving the tumor of nutrients.\n\n5. **Portal Vein Embolization (PVE)**: This technique is sometimes used to increase the future liver remnant volume before resection in patients with cirrhosis. By occluding the portal vein supplying the tumor, PVE encourages hypertrophy of the healthy liver tissue, making surgical resection safer.\n\nThe choice of surgical intervention is heavily influenced by the stage of the disease, liver function, and the overall health of the patient. The BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) staging system is commonly used to guide treatment decisions, ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate and effective surgical options based on their specific circumstances. \n\nRecent advancements in surgical techniques and technologies continue to improve outcomes for patients with HCC, making surgical management a cornerstone of curative treatment for this malignancy.
