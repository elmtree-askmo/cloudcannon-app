    What are the common congenital conditions addressed by plastic surgery?
answer: >-
    Plastic surgery addresses a variety of congenital conditions, which are abnormalities present at birth. Some of the most common congenital conditions treated by plastic surgeons include:\n\n1. **Cleft Lip and Palate**: This is one of the most prevalent congenital anomalies, where there is an opening in the upper lip and/or the roof of the mouth (palate). Surgical repair is typically performed to restore normal appearance and function.\n\n2. **Hand and Finger Abnormalities**: Conditions such as syndactyly (webbed fingers) and polydactyly (extra fingers) are often corrected through surgical intervention to improve function and appearance.\n\n3. **Craniosynostosis**: This condition involves the premature fusion of skull bones, which can affect the shape of the head and potentially lead to increased intracranial pressure. Surgical correction is necessary to allow for normal brain growth and to improve head shape.\n\n4. **Hemangiomas and Vascular Malformations**: These are benign tumors made up of blood vessels that can appear on the skin or internal organs. Surgical treatment may be required if they cause functional issues or cosmetic concerns.\n\n5. **Microtia**: This condition involves the underdevelopment or absence of the external ear (pinna). Surgical reconstruction can help improve both appearance and hearing.\n\n6. **Hypospadias**: A congenital condition in males where the urethra does not open at the tip of the penis. Surgical correction is performed to reposition the urethral opening and improve function.\n\n7. **Breast Asymmetry and Deformities**: In adolescents, conditions such as gynecomastia (development of male breasts) can be addressed through surgical procedures to correct asymmetry or deformities.\n\nThese congenital conditions often require a multidisciplinary approach, and the timing of surgical intervention is crucial to optimize outcomes. Plastic surgeons play a vital role in not only enhancing physical appearance but also improving functionality and quality of life for affected individuals.
