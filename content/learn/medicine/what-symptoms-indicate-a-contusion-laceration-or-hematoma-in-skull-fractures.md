answer: >-
    Symptoms indicating a contusion, laceration, or hematoma associated with skull fractures can vary based on the severity and type of injury. Here are some key symptoms to look for:\n\n1. **Contusion**: A contusion is essentially a bruise on the brain itself, resulting from trauma. Symptoms may include:\n   - Headache\n   - Confusion or disorientation\n   - Dizziness\n   - Nausea or vomiting\n   - Memory loss or difficulty concentrating\n   - Changes in behavior or mood\n\n2. **Laceration**: Brain lacerations occur when an object or a piece of bone penetrates the skull and tears brain tissue. Symptoms may include:\n   - Severe headache\n   - Loss of consciousness\n   - Neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, numbness)\n   - Seizures\n   - Clear fluid or blood leaking from the nose or ears (indicative of possible cerebrospinal fluid leakage)\n\n3. **Hematoma**: There are two main types of hematomas associated with skull fractures:\n   - **Epidural Hematoma**: This occurs when blood accumulates between the skull and the outer layer of the brain. Symptoms may include:\n     - A brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, then rapid deterioration\n     - Severe headache\n     - Nausea and vomiting\n     - Confusion or altered mental status\n   - **Subdural Hematoma**: This occurs when blood collects between the brain and the inner layer of the dura mater. Symptoms may include:\n     - Headache\n     - Confusion\n     - Drowsiness or lethargy\n     - Changes in behavior\n     - Weakness or difficulty with coordination\n\nIn general, any signs of severe head injury, such as loss of consciousness, persistent vomiting, seizures, or significant changes in behavior, warrant immediate medical attention. It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management, especially since these symptoms can indicate life-threatening conditions.
