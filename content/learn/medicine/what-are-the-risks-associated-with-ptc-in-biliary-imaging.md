    What are the risks associated with PTC in biliary imaging?
answer: >-
    Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is a minimally invasive procedure used to visualize the bile ducts and is generally considered safe. However, like any medical procedure, it carries certain risks and potential complications. The most commonly reported risks associated with PTC include:\n\n1. **Bleeding**: Given that the liver is a highly vascular organ, there is a risk of bleeding during or after the procedure. This complication has been noted in approximately 0.1% of patients.\n\n2. **Infection**: There is a risk of cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile duct, particularly if the bile is already infected. Although antibiotics are typically administered before the procedure to mitigate this risk, there remains a small chance of infection entering the bloodstream.\n\n3. **Bile Leakage**: This can occur if the bile ducts are inadvertently punctured during the procedure, leading to bile leaking into the surrounding tissues.\n\n4. **Cholangitis and Sepsis**: PTC is associated with a relatively high rate of post-procedural cholangitis, although the incidence of sepsis is low, and fatal events are rare.\n\n5. **Hepatic Arterial Injury**: While the risk of this complication is reduced by careful technique, it remains a potential concern during the procedure.\n\n6. **Other Complications**: Additional complications can include peritonitis, pancreatitis, and in rare cases, the formation of liver abscesses.\n\nOverall, while PTC is a valuable tool for diagnosing and managing biliary conditions, it is important for patients to be aware of these potential risks and to discuss them with their healthcare provider prior to the procedure.
