    What are the clinical reports on ketamine's effect on driving?
answer: >-
    Clinical reports on ketamine's effect on driving indicate that the substance significantly impairs various cognitive and motor functions essential for safe driving. Ketamine primarily acts by blocking NMDA receptors and has a high affinity for several neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABAergic receptors. This multifaceted action contributes to its psychomimetic and neurobehavioral effects, which are incompatible with driving.\n\nResearch has shown that ketamine can lead to substantial psychomotor performance impairment, particularly at plasma concentrations exceeding 50 ng/mL. The effects of ketamine on driving ability can last longer than one hour following a single average orally administered dose. A study by Guillermain et al. specifically examined the impact of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) on human reaction times, revealing significant impairments compared to a placebo.\n\nAdditionally, observational roadside studies in Australia have found that approximately 1.5% of drivers tested positive for ketamine. These studies utilized behavioral tasks to assess driver intoxication, demonstrating good specificity and predictive value for impairment when oral fluid and urine concentrations of ketamine were above 300 ng/mL.\n\nFurthermore, a study comparing ketamine with a ketamine-like medication, rapastinel, indicated that individuals administered ketamine reported increased sleepiness and decreased self-confidence in their driving abilities. This highlights the acute effects of ketamine, which can differ from its persistent effects over time.\n\nIn summary, the clinical evidence underscores the detrimental impact of ketamine on driving performance, necessitating caution and public safety measures for individuals using this substance.
