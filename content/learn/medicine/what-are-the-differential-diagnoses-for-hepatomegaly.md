    What are the differential diagnoses for hepatomegaly?
answer: >-
    Hepatomegaly, or abnormal enlargement of the liver, can arise from a variety of conditions. The differential diagnoses for hepatomegaly can be broadly categorized based on etiology, including:\n\n1. **Infectious Causes**:\n   - Viral hepatitis (acute and chronic), including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.\n   - Infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and malaria.\n   - Abscesses, which can be amoebic or pyogenic.\n\n2. **Metabolic Disorders**:\n   - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), previously known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n   - Alcoholic liver disease.\n   - Storage disorders, such as hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.\n\n3. **Neoplastic Conditions**:\n   - Primary liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoma.\n   - Metastatic liver cancer from other primary sites (e.g., breast, colon, lung cancers).\n\n4. **Hematological Disorders**:\n   - Leukaemia (chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia).\n   - Lymphoma.\n   - Hemolytic anemias.\n\n5. **Obstructive Causes**:\n   - Biliary obstruction, which can occur due to gallstones or tumors compressing the bile ducts.\n\n6. **Inflammatory Conditions**:\n   - Autoimmune hepatitis.\n   - Conditions leading to hepatic congestion, such as heart failure.\n\n7. **Toxic Causes**:\n   - Exposure to certain drugs or toxins that can lead to liver damage.\n\nGiven the wide range of potential causes, the evaluation of hepatomegaly often requires a comprehensive work-up to identify the underlying condition. This may include imaging studies, laboratory tests, and sometimes liver biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.
