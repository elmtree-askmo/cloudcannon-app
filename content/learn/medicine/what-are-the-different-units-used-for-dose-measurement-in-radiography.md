    What are the different units used for dose measurement in radiography?
answer: >-
    In radiography, various units are used to measure radiation dose, reflecting both international and U.S. standards. The primary units include:\n\n1. **Gray (Gy)**: This is the SI unit for absorbed dose, defined as one joule of energy deposited per kilogram of tissue (1 Gy = 1 J/kg). In clinical settings, doses are often expressed in milliGray (mGy), which is one-thousandth of a Gray.\n\n2. **Sievert (Sv)**: This is the SI unit for equivalent dose, which accounts for the biological effects of radiation on human tissue. It is used to express the risk associated with exposure to radiation. \n\n3. **Rad**: This is the traditional U.S. unit for absorbed dose, where 1 rad is equivalent to 0.01 Gray (1 rad = 0.01 Gy). \n\n4. **Rem**: This is the U.S. unit for dose equivalent, which also considers the biological effect of the type of radiation. One rem is equivalent to 0.01 sievert (1 rem = 0.01 Sv).\n\n5. **Roentgen (R)**: This unit measures exposure to ionizing radiation, specifically for X-rays and gamma rays. It is less commonly used in modern practice but may still be encountered.\n\n6. **Millisievert (mSv)** and **Millirem (mrem)**: These are subunits of sievert and rem, respectively, commonly used to express lower doses of radiation. For example, 1 mSv = 0.001 Sv and 1 mrem = 0.001 rem.\n\nIn summary, the key units for dose measurement in radiography are Gray (Gy) and Sievert (Sv) in the SI system, and Rad and Rem in the U.S. system, with their respective subunits for more precise measurements.
