    What are the risk factors and extra-pulmonary manifestations of genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB)?
answer: >-
    Genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) is a significant form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that primarily affects the urinary tract. Understanding the risk factors and extra-pulmonary manifestations associated with GUTB is crucial for diagnosis and management.\n\n### Risk Factors for GUTB\n1. **Diabetes Mellitus (DM)**: Individuals with diabetes are at a higher risk due to compromised immune function.\n2. **Older Age**: Aging can weaken the immune system, making older adults more susceptible to infections, including GUTB.\n3. **Low Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Being very thin may indicate malnutrition or other health issues that can increase vulnerability to infections.\n4. **Immunosuppressive Conditions**: Conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, increase the risk of developing GUTB.\n5. **Concomitant Cancers**: Patients with active cancers may have a higher risk due to their compromised immune status.\n6. **History of Pulmonary Tuberculosis**: Approximately 12% to 20% of individuals with a history of pulmonary TB may develop GUTB, often after a latency period of 5 to 40 years.\n\n### Extra-Pulmonary Manifestations of GUTB\nGUTB can lead to various complications and manifestations, including:\n- **Strictures**: Narrowing of the urinary tract, which can occur in the urethra, bladder, or other parts of the urinary system.\n- **Renal Failure**: Damage to the kidneys can occur due to the infection, leading to renal insufficiency or failure.\n- **Infertility**: In females, GUTB can affect the fallopian tubes, leading to infertility. In males, it can impact the vas deferens, also resulting in infertility.\n- **Involvement of Other Genital Structures**: GUTB can affect various structures, including the scrotum, epididymis, penis, testes, vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.\n\n### Conclusion\nGUTB is often diagnosed late due to its insidious nature and the need for a high index of suspicion. The risk factors primarily relate to immune status and previous TB infections, while the extra-pulmonary manifestations can significantly impact reproductive health and renal function. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent severe complications associated with this condition.
