    What are the common laboratory tests used in the investigation of liver cancer?
answer: >-
    In the investigation of liver cancer, several common laboratory tests are utilized to assess liver function and identify potential malignancies. These tests include:\n\n1. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: These tests measure various enzymes and substances in the blood to evaluate how well the liver is functioning. They typically include assessments of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).\n\n2. **Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)**: This is a specific blood test that measures the levels of AFP, a tumor marker often elevated in individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated AFP levels can indicate the presence of liver cancer, although they are not exclusively indicative of it.\n\n3. **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: This test provides information about the overall health of the patient and can help detect conditions such as anemia or infection, which may be relevant in the context of liver cancer.\n\n4. **Clotting Profile**: Since the liver plays a crucial role in producing clotting factors, this test assesses the blood's ability to clot and can indicate liver dysfunction.\n\n5. **Other Tumor Markers**: In addition to AFP, other markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) may be measured, particularly if there is a suspicion of bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) or other gastrointestinal malignancies.\n\nThese laboratory tests are often complemented by imaging studies (such as ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs) and, in some cases, a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of liver cancer. The combination of these tests helps healthcare providers to accurately diagnose and stage liver cancer, guiding appropriate treatment options.
