    How is physiology defined?
answer: >-
    Physiology is defined as the scientific study of the functions and mechanisms in living systems. It focuses on how organisms, organ systems, individual organs, cells, and biomolecules perform their chemical and physical functions. As a subdiscipline of biology, physiology encompasses various levels of organization, from the molecular and cellular levels to the integrated behavior of whole organisms.\n\nThe term "physiology" is derived from the Ancient Greek words φύσις (phúsis), meaning 'nature' or 'origin', and -λογία (-logia), meaning 'study of'. This field of study is essential for understanding the normal functions of living organisms and how their various systems interact to maintain life.\n\nPhysiology can be categorized into several subfields, including cell physiology, plant physiology, animal physiology, and human physiology, each focusing on specific aspects of living organisms. It also intersects with anatomy, which is the study of the structures of living things, highlighting the relationship between structure and function in biological systems.\n\nOverall, physiology aims to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the processes of life, making it a fundamental area of study in biology and medicine.
