    What is the composition of blood?
answer: >-
    The composition of blood consists of several key components, primarily categorized into plasma and formed elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Plasma**: This is the liquid component of blood, making up about 54.3% of its volume. Plasma is primarily composed of water (about 90-92%), but it also contains proteins, electrolytes, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. The proteins in plasma include albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen, which play crucial roles in maintaining osmotic pressure, immune responses, and blood clotting, respectively.\n\n2. **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)**: These cells constitute approximately 45% of whole blood. Their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein that binds to oxygen, giving blood its red color.\n\n3. **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)**: Making up about 0.7% of blood volume, white blood cells are essential for the immune system. They help defend the body against infections and foreign invaders. There are several types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, each with specific functions in immune response.\n\n4. **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**: These are cell-like particles that play a critical role in blood clotting. They are smaller than red and white blood cells and are essential for preventing excessive bleeding when injuries occur.\n\nIn summary, blood is a complex fluid connective tissue composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, each contributing to vital functions such as oxygen transport, immune defense, and clotting.
