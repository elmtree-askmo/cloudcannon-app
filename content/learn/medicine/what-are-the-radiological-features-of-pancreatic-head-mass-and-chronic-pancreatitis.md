    What are the radiological features of pancreatic head mass and chronic pancreatitis?
answer: >-
    The radiological features of pancreatic head mass and chronic pancreatitis can be distinguished through various imaging modalities, primarily CT and MRI.\n\n### Pancreatic Head Mass\n1. **CT Imaging**: \n   - A pancreatic head mass typically appears as a hypovascular mass on CT scans. Key features include:\n     - Upstream pancreatic duct dilatation.\n     - Abrupt cutoff of the pancreatic duct.\n     - Distal pancreatic atrophy.\n     - Vascular encasement, particularly of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or portal vein, which may indicate malignancy.\n     - In cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the mass may show extensive perineural growth and encasement of surrounding vessels, making it irresectable in some instances.\n\n2. **MRI Imaging**:\n   - On T1-weighted MR images, a pancreatic head mass may appear predominantly hypointense. The mass can also show abnormal signal intensity, with homogenous hypointensity on gradient-echo T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on turbo-spin-echo T2-weighted images.\n\n### Chronic Pancreatitis\n1. **CT Imaging**:\n   - Classical findings of chronic pancreatitis on CT include:\n     - Pancreatic atrophy.\n     - Dilated pancreatic duct.\n     - Presence of pancreatic calcifications.\n     - Pseudocysts may also be identified as complications of chronic pancreatitis.\n\n2. **MRI Imaging**:\n   - MRI findings in chronic pancreatitis may show:\n     - Focal or diffuse pancreatic enlargement with sharp borders.\n     - Abnormal signal intensity, typically homogenous hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.\n\n3. **Ultrasound**:\n   - Conventional ultrasound may reveal changes such as increased echogenicity of the pancreas, which is indicative of fibrosis. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can provide additional information regarding vascularity and perfusion of pancreatic lesions.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\n- It is crucial to differentiate between an inflammatory pancreatic mass (such as that seen in chronic pancreatitis) and pancreatic cancer, as both can present similarly on imaging. The presence of vascular involvement and specific imaging characteristics can aid in this differentiation.\n\nIn summary, while both pancreatic head masses and chronic pancreatitis can present with overlapping features, careful analysis of imaging characteristics can help in making an accurate diagnosis.
