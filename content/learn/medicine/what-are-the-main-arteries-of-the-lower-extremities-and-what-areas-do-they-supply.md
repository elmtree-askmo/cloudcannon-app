    What are the main arteries of the lower extremities, and what areas do they supply?
answer: >-
    The main arteries of the lower extremities originate from the common iliac arteries, which bifurcate from the abdominal aorta at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4). The key arteries and the areas they supply are as follows:\n\n1. **Common Iliac Arteries**: These arteries bifurcate into the internal and external iliac arteries. The external iliac artery continues as the femoral artery.\n\n2. **Femoral Artery**: This is the direct continuation of the external iliac artery. It supplies the majority of the thigh and continues down to the knee, where it becomes the popliteal artery.\n\n3. **Popliteal Artery**: Located behind the knee, the popliteal artery branches into:\n   - **Anterior Tibial Artery**: Supplies the anterior compartment of the leg and continues to the dorsum of the foot.\n   - **Posterior Tibial Artery**: Supplies the posterior compartment of the leg and branches into the medial and lateral plantar arteries, which supply the foot.\n   - **Fibular (Peroneal) Artery**: Supplies the lateral compartment of the leg.\n\n4. **Dorsal Arches of the Foot**: Formed by the anterior tibial artery and the branches of the posterior tibial artery, these arches supply blood to the foot.\n\n5. **Genicular Branches**: These branches arise from the popliteal artery and supply the knee joint.\n\nIn summary, the arterial supply to the lower extremities includes the common iliac arteries, femoral artery, popliteal artery, and their branches, which collectively supply the gluteal region, thigh, knee, leg, and foot.
