    How do the vertebral arteries contribute to the blood supply of the brain?
answer: >-
    The vertebral arteries play a crucial role in supplying blood to the brain, particularly to the posterior regions. Each vertebral artery originates from the subclavian artery and ascends through the neck, entering the skull through the foramen magnum. Upon reaching the pons, the two vertebral arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which further branches into the posterior cerebral arteries.\n\nThe vertebral arteries are responsible for providing approximately 20-30% of the brain's blood flow, primarily supplying the brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobes, and parts of the thalamus. This system is often referred to as the posterior circulation, in contrast to the anterior circulation supplied by the internal carotid arteries.\n\nAdditionally, the vertebral arteries contribute to the formation of the circle of Willis, an important anastomotic ring at the base of the brain that connects the anterior and posterior circulations. This connection is vital for maintaining adequate blood flow to the brain, especially in cases where one of the primary arteries may be compromised.\n\nIn summary, the vertebral arteries are essential for ensuring a robust blood supply to critical areas of the brain, supporting vital functions and overall neurological health.
