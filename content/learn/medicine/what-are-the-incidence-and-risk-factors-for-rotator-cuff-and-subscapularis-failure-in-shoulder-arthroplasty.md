    What are the incidence and risk factors for rotator cuff and subscapularis failure in shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    The incidence and risk factors for rotator cuff and subscapularis failure in shoulder arthroplasty are important considerations for surgical outcomes. \n\n### Incidence\nRotator cuff tears and subscapularis failure are among the most commonly reported complications following anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA). In a study involving 2,085 patients, rotator cuff tear and/or subscapularis failure occurred in 69 patients, representing an incidence of approximately 3.1%. Notably, this complication accounted for 28.9% of all aTSA complications and 33.9% of all revisions at a mean follow-up of 23 months.\n\n### Risk Factors\nSeveral risk factors have been identified that contribute to the failure of the rotator cuff and subscapularis:\n\n1. **Patient Age**: Older patients are at a higher risk for rotator cuff tears and subsequent failure.\n2. **Size of Tears**: Larger rotator cuff tears have been associated with an increased risk of failure following repair.\n3. **Subscapularis Management**: The technique used for managing the subscapularis during surgery can influence outcomes. Subscapularis repair has been linked to lower instability rates postoperatively, suggesting that failure to adequately repair this tendon may lead to complications.\n4. **Immobilization Protocols**: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal duration of immobilization and rehabilitation protocols, which may impact the healing of the subscapularis and rotator cuff.\n5. **Pre-existing Conditions**: Patients with a history of rotator cuff tears or other shoulder pathologies may have a higher risk of postoperative complications.\n\nIn summary, while the incidence of rotator cuff and subscapularis failure in shoulder arthroplasty is relatively low, understanding the associated risk factors is crucial for improving surgical outcomes and minimizing complications.
