answer: >-
    The symptoms associated with acute arterial occlusion are commonly referred to as the "Six P's." These symptoms indicate a sudden loss of blood flow to the affected limb and are critical for diagnosis and timely intervention. The Six P's are:\n\n1. **Pain**: Sudden and severe pain in the affected limb, often described as a sharp or throbbing sensation.\n2. **Pallor**: The limb may appear pale or white due to lack of blood flow.\n3. **Pulselessness**: Absence of pulse in the affected limb, indicating a significant reduction or complete loss of blood supply.\n4. **Paresthesia**: Abnormal sensations such as tingling or numbness in the limb.\n5. **Paralysis**: Weakness or inability to move the affected limb, which can occur as ischemia progresses.\n6. **Poikilothermia**: The limb may feel cool to the touch, reflecting the loss of blood flow and the body's inability to maintain normal temperature.\n\nImmediate recognition of these symptoms is crucial, as acute arterial occlusion is a surgical emergency that can lead to irreversible tissue damage if not treated promptly.
