    What is the role of fine needle aspiration cytology in diagnosing thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. It is widely regarded as the gold standard diagnostic tool for evaluating these nodules due to its high diagnostic accuracy. FNAC is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for the collection of cellular material from the thyroid nodule, which can then be examined microscopically to determine the presence of malignancy.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that FNAC significantly improves the management of thyroid nodules. For instance, patients who undergo preoperative FNAC tend to receive more optimal surgical treatment compared to those who do not. The procedure is particularly effective when used in conjunction with clinical assessments and ultrasonographic findings, enhancing the overall diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of FNAC for diagnosing neoplastic solitary thyroid nodules have been reported to be around 80% and 86.6%, respectively. This indicates that FNAC is a reliable method for distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules, thereby reducing unnecessary surgical interventions. Additionally, the routine application of FNAC has led to an increase in the detection of thyroid cancers during surgical procedures, highlighting its importance in preoperative evaluation.\n\nMoreover, FNAC can be complemented by advanced diagnostic techniques such as immunocytochemical studies and molecular pathology, which further enhance its prognostic value. Overall, FNAC is a simple, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic test that plays a central role in the management of thyroid nodules, helping to predict malignancy and avoid unnecessary surgeries.
