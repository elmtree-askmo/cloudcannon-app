    What are the characteristics of cystic lesions like sebaceous cysts and implantation dermoid?
answer: >-
    Cystic lesions, such as sebaceous cysts and implantation dermoids, exhibit distinct characteristics that differentiate them from other skin conditions.\n\n### Sebaceous Cysts\nSebaceous cysts, also known as epidermal inclusion cysts, are benign growths that typically develop under the skin, often on the face, neck, or upper body. Here are their key characteristics:\n\n- **Composition**: They are filled with sebum, a substance produced by sebaceous glands, and may also contain keratin, dead skin cells, and lipids. If a sebaceous cyst ruptures, it can release a pasty or cheesy substance that may have a foul odor.\n- **Appearance**: These cysts are usually smooth, small, and spherical, with a size that can vary up to 5 cm in diameter. They may have an enlarged pore overlying them.\n- **Symptoms**: While sebaceous cysts are generally asymptomatic, they can become painful or swollen if infected, leading to signs of infection such as redness, warmth, and drainage of pus.\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: They can mimic other skin conditions like lipomas, abscesses, or epidermoid cysts, necessitating careful evaluation of their consistency, location, and appearance for accurate diagnosis.\n\n### Implantation Dermoids\nImplantation dermoid cysts are another type of cystic lesion, characterized by the following features:\n\n- **Location**: These cysts often occur at the site of a previous laceration or surgical scar and can be found on the face, neck, or scalp.\n- **Composition**: Unlike sebaceous cysts, implantation dermoids do not have adnexal structures and are typically filled with a mixture of skin-derived tissues, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands.\n- **Appearance**: They present as firm, dough-like lumps that can range in size from 0.5 to 6 cm in diameter. They are usually solitary and may be associated with a nearby pit or sinus tract.\n- **Histological Features**: On histological examination, implantation dermoids can be distinguished from congenital dermoid cysts due to their different pathogenesis and the absence of adnexal structures.\n\nBoth types of cystic lesions are generally benign but may require management if they become symptomatic or for cosmetic reasons. Understanding their characteristics is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
