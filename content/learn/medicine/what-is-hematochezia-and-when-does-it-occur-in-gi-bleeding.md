    Hematochezia is the passage of fresh, bright red blood from the rectum, indicating potential lower gastrointestinal bleeding, though it can also occur due to brisk upper GI bleeding. It necessitates clinical assessment to determine the source and severity of the bleeding.

    What is hematochezia and when does it occur in GI bleeding?
answer: >-
    Hematochezia is defined as the passage of fresh, bright red blood via the rectum. It is typically indicative of bleeding that originates from the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is anatomically defined as the region distal to the ligament of Treitz. This ligament is a thin band of tissue that connects and supports the end of the duodenum and the beginning of the jejunum.\n\nWhile hematochezia is most commonly associated with lower GI bleeding, it can also occur in cases of brisk upper GI bleeding. This means that if there is a significant amount of bleeding from the upper GI tract, the blood may not have enough time to be altered by the digestive process, resulting in fresh red blood being passed through the rectum.\n\nIn clinical settings, hematochezia can be a concerning symptom, as it may indicate a range of underlying health issues, from benign conditions to more serious pathologies. It is important for healthcare providers to assess the patient's overall condition, including hemodynamic stability, to determine the source and severity of the bleeding.
