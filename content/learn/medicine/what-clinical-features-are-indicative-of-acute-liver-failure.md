    What clinical features are indicative of acute liver failure?
answer: >-
    Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by a rapid deterioration of liver function, often occurring in individuals without pre-existing liver disease. The clinical features indicative of acute liver failure include:\n\n1. **Jaundice**: This is the yellowing of the skin and eyes due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.\n2. **Coagulopathy**: Patients may exhibit signs of bleeding or easy bruising due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors by the liver.\n3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: This condition manifests as disorientation, confusion, and an inability to concentrate, which can progress to more severe neurological symptoms.\n4. **Abdominal Pain**: Patients may experience discomfort or pain in the abdominal region.\n5. **General Malaise**: A feeling of overall discomfort or unease is common.\n6. **Nausea and Vomiting**: These gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported.\n7. **Sleepiness**: Increased drowsiness or lethargy can occur as liver function declines.\n\nIn addition to these symptoms, acute liver failure can lead to serious complications such as increased intracranial pressure and bleeding. It is crucial to recognize these clinical features early, as ALF is a medical emergency that often requires intensive care and may necessitate liver transplantation for survival.
