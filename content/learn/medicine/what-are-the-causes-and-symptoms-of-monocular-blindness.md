    What are the causes and symptoms of monocular blindness?
answer: >-
    Monocular blindness, or unilateral vision loss, can occur due to various causes, which can be categorized into traumatic and non-traumatic origins. The most common causes of monocular blindness include:\n\n1. **Optic Atrophy**: This condition is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases or central nervous system tumors, leading to damage of the optic nerve.\n\n2. **Amblyopia**: Also known as "lazy eye," this condition can result in reduced vision in one eye if not treated early in childhood.\n\n3. **Phthisis Bulbi**: This is a condition where the eye becomes non-functional due to severe damage or disease.\n\n4. **Amaurosis Fugax**: This is a transient monocular visual loss caused by temporary reductions in blood flow to the retina, often due to embolic or hemodynamic factors. Patients may experience a "black curtain" effect descending in their field of vision. It is crucial for individuals experiencing this symptom to seek immediate medical attention, as it may indicate underlying vascular issues such as transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes.\n\n5. **Ocular and Neurological Causes**: Other causes can include conditions like giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, and optic neuropathies. These conditions can lead to either temporary or permanent vision loss depending on their severity and duration.\n\nSymptoms of monocular blindness can vary but typically include:\n- Complete or partial loss of vision in one eye.\n- Blurred vision or shadowing in the visual field.\n- A sensation of a curtain or veil over the eye.\n\nIn summary, monocular blindness can arise from a range of conditions, and its symptoms can significantly impact daily life, particularly affecting depth perception and overall visual acuity. Prompt medical evaluation is essential to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
