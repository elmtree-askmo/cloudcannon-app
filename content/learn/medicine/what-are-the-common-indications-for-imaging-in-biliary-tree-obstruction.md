    What are the common indications for imaging in biliary tree obstruction?
answer: >-
    Common indications for imaging in biliary tree obstruction include:\n\n1. **Obstructive Jaundice**: Imaging is often performed when patients present with jaundice, particularly when the cause is unclear. This can help identify the level and cause of obstruction.\n\n2. **Pancreatitis**: Imaging is indicated in cases of pancreatitis to evaluate for potential complications such as biliary obstruction due to gallstones.\n\n3. **Cholelithiasis**: The presence of gallstones can lead to obstruction, and imaging is necessary to assess their location and impact on the biliary tree.\n\n4. **Sclerosing Cholangitis**: This condition can cause strictures in the biliary tree, necessitating imaging to evaluate the extent of the disease.\n\n5. **Ductal Plate Malformations and Choledochal Cysts**: These congenital anomalies can lead to obstruction and require imaging for diagnosis and management.\n\n6. **Liver Transplant Complications**: Imaging is crucial in assessing biliary complications that may arise post-liver transplantation.\n\n7. **Acute Cholangitis**: In cases of acute cholangitis, imaging is essential for diagnosis and to guide treatment, as biliary decompression may be lifesaving.\n\n8. **Biliary Strictures**: Imaging is used to evaluate the presence and cause of strictures, which can be benign or malignant.\n\n9. **Pre-procedural Planning**: Imaging is required before interventions such as percutaneous drainage for conditions like biliary stone disease or strictures.\n\n10. **Assessment of Biliary Stent Patency**: Imaging is indicated to evaluate the patency of stents placed in the biliary tree.\n\nImaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT, MRCP, and ERCP are commonly employed to assess these conditions, with each modality offering unique advantages in terms of visualization and functional assessment of the biliary tree.
