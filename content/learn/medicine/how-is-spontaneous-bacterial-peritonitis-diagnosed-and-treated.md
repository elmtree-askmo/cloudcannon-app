    How is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis diagnosed and treated?
answer: >-
    Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious infection that occurs in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, characterized by the infection of ascitic fluid without an identifiable intra-abdominal source. The diagnosis and treatment of SBP are critical due to the potential for rapid deterioration in affected patients.\n\n### Diagnosis of SBP\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: SBP is suspected in patients with ascites who present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or altered mental status. It is important to note that some patients may be asymptomatic, and the absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis.\n\n2. **High-Risk Factors**: A high index of suspicion should be maintained, especially in patients with recent clinical deterioration, older age, or those on proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). \n\n3. **Peritoneal Fluid Analysis**: The definitive diagnosis of SBP is made through the analysis of ascitic fluid obtained via paracentesis. Key parameters to evaluate include:\n   - **Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count**: A count greater than 500 cells/uL is indicative of SBP.\n   - **Culture and Sensitivity**: Culturing the fluid helps identify the causative organisms, which are predominantly gram-negative enteric bacteria such as *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.\n   - **Other Tests**: Additional tests may include lactate level and pH of the ascitic fluid.\n\n### Treatment of SBP\n\n1. **Hospitalization**: Patients diagnosed with SBP typically require hospitalization for close monitoring and treatment.\n\n2. **Antibiotic Therapy**: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as SBP is suspected, particularly if the PMN count is above 500 cells/uL. Commonly used antibiotics include:\n   - Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime).\n   - Antibiotics should be adjusted based on culture results and susceptibility testing.\n\n3. **Supportive Care**: Alongside antibiotics, supportive care is essential to manage symptoms and complications. This may include fluid management, electrolyte monitoring, and treatment of any associated conditions.\n\n4. **Prophylaxis**: For patients at high risk of developing SBP, prophylactic antibiotics may be considered to prevent recurrence.\n\n5. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for signs of septic shock or multi-organ failure is crucial, as early intervention can significantly improve outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the diagnosis of SBP relies on clinical suspicion and peritoneal fluid analysis, while treatment involves prompt initiation of antibiotics and supportive care. Early recognition and management are vital to improving patient outcomes in this potentially life-threatening condition.
