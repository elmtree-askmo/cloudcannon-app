    What are the main types of cells in the nervous system and their functions?
answer: >-
    The nervous system is primarily composed of two main types of cells: neurons and glial cells, each serving distinct and essential functions.\n\n### 1. Neurons\nNeurons, or nerve cells, are the fundamental units of the nervous system responsible for processing and transmitting information. They are electrically active and communicate through electrochemical signals. Neurons can be further classified into three main types based on their function:\n\n- **Sensory Neurons**: These neurons detect and transmit signals from sensory receptors in the external environment to the central nervous system (CNS). They play a crucial role in gathering information about the body's surroundings.\n  \n- **Motor Neurons**: These neurons convey signals from the CNS to muscles and glands, facilitating movement and responses to stimuli.\n\n- **Interneurons**: Found primarily in the CNS, interneurons connect sensory and motor neurons and are involved in processing information and reflexes.\n\n### 2. Glial Cells\nGlial cells, also known as neuroglia, provide support, nourishment, and insulation to neurons. They are essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the nervous system and can be categorized into several types:\n\n- **Astrocytes**: These star-shaped cells regulate ion concentrations around neurons, provide nutrients, and help in the formation of new synaptic connections.\n\n- **Microglia**: Acting as the immune cells of the CNS, microglia respond to inflammation and clear debris from damaged neurons.\n\n- **Ependymal Cells**: These cells line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord, playing a role in the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n- **Oligodendrocytes**: These cells form the myelin sheath around axons in the CNS, which facilitates the rapid transmission of electrical impulses.\n\n- **Schwann Cells**: In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells also form the myelin sheath and are involved in the regeneration of damaged nerves.\n\n- **Satellite Cells**: These cells provide structural support and nutrients to neurons in the PNS.\n\nIn summary, neurons are the primary cells responsible for communication within the nervous system, while glial cells support and protect these neurons, ensuring the proper functioning of the nervous system as a whole.
