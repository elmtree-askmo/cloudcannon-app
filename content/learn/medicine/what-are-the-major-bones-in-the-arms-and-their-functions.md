    What are the major bones in the arms and their functions?
answer: >-
    The major bones in the arms include the humerus, radius, and ulna, each playing a crucial role in the structure and function of the upper limb.\n\n1. **Humerus**: \n   - The humerus is the longest bone in the arm, extending from the shoulder to the elbow. It serves as the primary bone of the upper arm and is involved in forming the elbow joint with the ulna and radius. The humerus provides attachment points for muscles that facilitate arm movement and is essential for a wide range of motions at the shoulder.\n\n2. **Radius**: \n   - The radius is one of the two long bones in the forearm, located on the lateral side (thumb side) when in the standard anatomical position. It is thicker at the wrist and thinner at the elbow. The radius allows for the rotation of the forearm, which is crucial for movements such as turning the palm up or down. It also plays a significant role in forming the wrist joint with the carpal bones.\n\n3. **Ulna**: \n   - The ulna is the other long bone in the forearm, situated on the medial side (pinky side). It is longer than the radius and contributes to the formation of the elbow joint with the humerus. The ulna helps maintain the structure of the forearm and works in conjunction with the radius to facilitate wrist and hand movements. The ulna is also involved in the pivoting motion that allows for a greater range of motion in the wrist.\n\nTogether, these bones provide structural support, enable a wide range of movements, and serve as attachment points for muscles and ligaments that facilitate the function of the arm and hand. The intricate relationship between the humerus, radius, and ulna allows for complex actions such as lifting, throwing, and manipulating objects.
