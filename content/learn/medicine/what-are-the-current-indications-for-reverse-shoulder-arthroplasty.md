    What are the current indications for reverse shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    The current indications for reverse shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) have expanded significantly over the years, reflecting its growing acceptance as a reliable surgical option for various shoulder disorders. The primary indications include:\n\n1. **Rotator Cuff Deficiency**: rTSA is particularly indicated for patients with rotator-cuff-deficient glenohumeral arthropathies, where traditional anatomic shoulder arthroplasty may not yield satisfactory results.\n\n2. **Primary Osteoarthritis**: It is recommended for patients with primary osteoarthritis, especially when there is glenoid deficiency.\n\n3. **Massive Rotator Cuff Tears**: rTSA is indicated for patients with irreparable massive rotator cuff tears, even in the absence of significant arthritis.\n\n4. **Proximal Humerus Fractures**: The procedure is also indicated for complex proximal humerus fractures, particularly in older patients where other surgical options may not be viable.\n\n5. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis with significant shoulder involvement may benefit from rTSA.\n\n6. **Chronic Glenohumeral Dislocation**: rTSA can be a solution for patients with chronic dislocations of the shoulder joint.\n\n7. **Failed Previous Surgeries**: It is indicated for patients who have had unsuccessful outcomes from previous shoulder surgeries, such as failed hemiarthroplasty or anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty.\n\n8. **Glenoid Deformity**: rTSA is also used in cases of glenoid deformity that complicate other forms of shoulder arthroplasty.\n\nOverall, rTSA is indicated for patients who experience persistent pain and loss of function due to advanced joint pathology and have not found relief through conservative management. The procedure involves replacing the head of the humerus and resurfacing the glenoid fossa, effectively reversing their anatomical positions to improve shoulder function. \n\nAs the understanding of shoulder pathologies evolves, the indications for rTSA continue to expand, making it a versatile option in shoulder surgery.
