    How do mechanical thrombectomy devices like Rotarex and AngioJet work?
answer: >-
    Mechanical thrombectomy devices, such as the Rotarex and AngioJet, are designed to remove thrombus (blood clots) from blood vessels, particularly in cases of acute ischemia of the lower extremities. Each device employs distinct mechanisms to achieve effective thrombectomy.\n\n### Rotarex\nThe Rotarex device utilizes a unique approach that combines mechanical and aspiration techniques. It features a coated stainless steel spiral that rotates within the vessel, effectively breaking up the thrombus. The rotating mechanism allows for the efficient removal of both plaque and thrombus, making it suitable for treating various conditions, including acute arterial embolization and in-stent restenosis. The efficiency of the Rotarex device is notable, with literature estimating a first-pass recanalization success rate of up to 97.5%. The procedure can restore vessel patency within approximately 30 minutes, making it a quick and effective option for patients experiencing acute limb ischemia.\n\n### AngioJet\nThe AngioJet device operates on a hydrodynamic principle, known as rheolytic thrombectomy. It uses high-velocity saline jets to create a vacuum effect that dislodges and aspirates the thrombus. This method allows for the removal of thrombus while minimizing damage to the surrounding vascular tissue. The AngioJet is particularly effective in cases where rapid thrombus removal is necessary, and it has been associated with a lower overall mortality rate in clinical studies.\n\n### Comparison and Clinical Application\nBoth devices have been evaluated in various studies to compare their effectiveness and safety. In a physiological circulation model, metrics such as first-pass recanalization rates and the weight of remaining thrombus post-removal were used to assess performance. While both devices are effective, the choice between them may depend on specific clinical scenarios, the nature of the thrombus, and the operator's experience.\n\nIn summary, mechanical thrombectomy devices like Rotarex and AngioJet provide minimally invasive options for treating acute ischemia by effectively removing thrombus from affected vessels, thereby restoring blood flow and alleviating ischemic symptoms.
