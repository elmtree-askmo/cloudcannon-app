answer: >-
    In suspected cases of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) of the shoulder, clinicians should be vigilant for several specific signs of infection. The most common symptom is joint pain, which may be accompanied by other local symptoms indicative of infection. These include:\n\n1. **Erythema**: Redness around the joint area.\n2. **Swelling**: Increased size of the joint due to inflammation.\n3. **Warmth**: Elevated temperature in the joint region, suggesting an inflammatory response.\n4. **Loosening of the prosthetic joint**: This can indicate that the infection is affecting the stability of the implant.\n\nAdditionally, while these signs are important, it is crucial to note that the clinical presentation of shoulder PJIs can sometimes be less obvious, especially in cases involving lower virulence organisms like Cutibacterium acnes. In such instances, symptoms may be more indolent, making diagnosis more challenging.\n\nClinicians should also be aware that a draining sinus can be a diagnostic sign of infection. Given the complexity of PJIs, a thorough clinical evaluation, including imaging and possibly fluid analysis, is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.
