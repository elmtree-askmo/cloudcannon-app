    What are the different layers of the uterus and their functions?
answer: >-
    The uterus, a key organ in the female reproductive system, is composed of three distinct layers, each with specific functions:\n\n1. **Endometrium**: This is the innermost layer of the uterus. It consists of an epithelial layer and a cell-rich connective tissue layer known as the lamina propria. The endometrium is highly specialized and plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, as it undergoes cyclical changes in response to ovarian hormones. It is the layer that thickens in preparation for a potential pregnancy and is shed during menstruation if fertilization does not occur.\n\n2. **Myometrium**: The middle layer of the uterus, the myometrium is made up of smooth muscle fibers. This layer is the thickest of the three and is responsible for the contractions of the uterus during labor and delivery. The myometrium undergoes hypertrophy (increase in cell size) and hyperplasia (increase in cell number) during pregnancy to accommodate the growing fetus and to facilitate childbirth.\n\n3. **Perimetrium**: The outermost layer, also known as the serosa, is a double-layered membrane that is continuous with the abdominal peritoneum. The perimetrium provides an outer protective covering for the uterus and helps anchor it within the pelvic cavity.\n\nThese layers work together to support the various functions of the uterus, including menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth.
