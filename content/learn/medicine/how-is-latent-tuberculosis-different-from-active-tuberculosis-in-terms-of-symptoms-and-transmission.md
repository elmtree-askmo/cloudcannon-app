answer: >-
    Latent tuberculosis (LTBI) and active tuberculosis (TB) are two distinct forms of tuberculosis infection, primarily differentiated by symptoms and transmission potential.\n\n### Symptoms\n- **Latent Tuberculosis (LTBI)**: Individuals with LTBI do not exhibit any symptoms. The TB bacteria are present in the body but are dormant (asleep), meaning they are not actively multiplying. A chest X-ray for someone with LTBI typically appears normal, and there is no evidence of clinically manifested active disease.\n  \n- **Active Tuberculosis (TB)**: In contrast, active TB is characterized by the presence of symptoms due to the bacteria multiplying in the body. Common symptoms of active TB include:\n  - A persistent cough that lasts for three weeks or longer\n  - Chest pain\n  - Coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm)\n  - Chills\n  - Fever\n  - Night sweats\n  - Unintentional weight loss\n\n### Transmission\n- **Latent Tuberculosis (LTBI)**: Individuals with LTBI are not contagious. Since the bacteria are inactive, they cannot spread the infection to others.\n\n- **Active Tuberculosis (TB)**: Active TB is contagious and can be transmitted to others through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The bacteria can be spread to individuals who are in close contact with the infected person.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between latent and active tuberculosis lie in the presence of symptoms and the ability to transmit the infection. LTBI is asymptomatic and non-contagious, while active TB presents with significant symptoms and poses a risk of transmission to others.
