    What are the surgical options for treating benign thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Surgical options for treating benign thyroid nodules primarily include two types of procedures: lobectomy and total thyroidectomy. The choice between these options depends on the size of the nodule and the presence of any symptoms.\n\n1. **Lobectomy**: This procedure involves the removal of one lobe of the thyroid gland. It is typically recommended for benign nodules that are larger than 4 cm or for those that cause local pressure symptoms such as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), shortness of breath, hoarseness, or neck pain. Lobectomy can effectively alleviate these symptoms while preserving some thyroid function.\n\n2. **Total Thyroidectomy**: This is the complete removal of the thyroid gland and may be indicated in cases where the nodule is particularly large, symptomatic, or if there are concerns about the potential for malignancy. Historically, total thyroidectomy was a common approach for managing thyroid nodules, but more recent practices have shifted towards more conservative surgeries when appropriate.\n\nIn addition to these surgical options, some patients may be monitored through a strategy known as "watchful waiting," especially if the nodules are asymptomatic and benign. This involves regular follow-up visits and assessments to ensure that the nodules do not change in size or character.\n\nOverall, the management of benign thyroid nodules has evolved, with a focus on individualized treatment plans that consider the patient's specific circumstances, including the size of the nodule and any associated symptoms.
