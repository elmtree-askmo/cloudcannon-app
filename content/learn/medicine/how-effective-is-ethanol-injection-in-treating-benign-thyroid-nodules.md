    How effective is ethanol injection in treating benign thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Ethanol injection, specifically percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), is recognized as a safe and effective treatment option for benign cystic and predominantly cystic thyroid nodules. Although it is not routinely performed in the United States, studies have shown that PEI can significantly reduce the size of these nodules and alleviate associated symptoms, particularly in cases where the nodules cause compressive symptoms.\n\nThe procedure involves the injection of ethanol directly into the nodule under ultrasound guidance, which leads to the destruction of the cystic components of the nodule. This method has several advantages over traditional surgical approaches, including being less painful, suitable for outpatient settings, and carrying a lower risk of transient or permanent side effects.\n\nResearch indicates that PEI is particularly effective for cystic thyroid nodules, with studies demonstrating positive outcomes in terms of nodule size reduction and symptom relief. For instance, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PEI in 120 patients with benign thyroid nodules found it to be a viable alternative to surgery.\n\nIn summary, while PEI may not be widely adopted in all regions, it is considered an effective treatment for benign cystic thyroid nodules, providing a less invasive option with favorable outcomes.
