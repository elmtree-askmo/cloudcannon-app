    What types of amphetamines are most commonly associated with driving impairment?
answer: >-
    The types of amphetamines most commonly associated with driving impairment include both legal and illegal forms. The primary amphetamines that have been studied in relation to driving impairment are:\n\n1. **Methamphetamine**: This powerful stimulant is often associated with significant driving impairment. It is commonly known in its illegal form as "speed," which can be consumed in various ways, including snorting, smoking, or injecting. Methamphetamine has been linked to decreased driving performance and increased traffic-related risks.\n\n2. **Dextroamphetamine**: This is a legal prescription medication used to treat conditions like ADHD. Studies have shown that even at relatively low doses (around 30 mg), dextroamphetamine can lead to decreased simulated driving performance, particularly during tasks that require sustained attention.\n\n3. **Levoamphetamine**: Similar to dextroamphetamine, this is another form of amphetamine that can affect driving abilities, although it is less commonly discussed in the context of driving impairment.\n\n4. **Lisdexamfetamine**: This is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine, meaning it is converted into dextroamphetamine in the body. Its effects on driving are similar to those of dextroamphetamine.\n\nResearch indicates that while some low doses of amphetamines may enhance certain psychomotor skills, higher concentrations are associated with impaired driving performance. A study noted that younger drivers were more frequently judged impaired than older drivers at similar concentrations of amphetamines, highlighting the varying effects based on demographics.\n\nOverall, the presence of amphetamines in a driver's system is a significant concern for road safety, as they can lead to both acute and chronic impairments in driving ability.
