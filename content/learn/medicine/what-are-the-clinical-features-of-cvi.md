    What are the clinical features of CVI?
answer: >-
    Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterized by a range of clinical features that primarily affect the lower extremities due to persistent ambulatory venous hypertension. The clinical manifestations of CVI can vary widely among individuals, but common symptoms and signs include:\n\n1. **Swelling (Edema)**: Patients often experience significant swelling in the legs or ankles, particularly after prolonged standing or sitting.\n\n2. **Leg Discomfort**: Many individuals report a dull aching, cramping, or heavy feeling in the legs. This discomfort may improve with leg elevation.\n\n3. **Skin Changes**: As CVI progresses, skin changes may occur, including:\n   - Brown discoloration of the skin, particularly near the ankles.\n   - Itching or tingling sensations in the legs.\n   - Development of varicose veins, which are enlarged and twisted veins visible under the skin.\n\n4. **Pain**: Patients may experience pain when walking, which typically subsides with rest. This pain can be more pronounced in cases of deep venous insufficiency.\n\n5. **Leg Ulcers**: In advanced cases, patients may develop open sores or ulcers on the legs, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to complications.\n\n6. **Restless Legs Syndrome**: Some individuals may have an uncomfortable feeling in their legs, leading to an urge to move them, especially at night.\n\n7. **Cramps or Muscle Spasms**: Painful leg cramps or muscle spasms, often referred to as "charley horses," can also be a symptom of CVI.\n\nThese clinical features not only impact the physical health of patients but can also significantly affect their quality of life. Early recognition and management of CVI are crucial to prevent progression and complications such as venous ulcers and infections.
