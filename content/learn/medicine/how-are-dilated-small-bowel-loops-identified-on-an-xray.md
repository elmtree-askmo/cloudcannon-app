    How are dilated small bowel loops identified on an X-ray?
answer: >-
    Dilated small bowel loops can be identified on an X-ray through several key radiological features. The diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, which often presents with dilated loops, relies on the following characteristics:\n\n1. **Location and Size**: Dilated small bowel loops are typically located centrally in the abdomen and are often greater than 3 cm in diameter. This dilation is disproportionate compared to the collapsed large bowel, which may appear gasless.\n\n2. **Valvulae Conniventes**: The presence of valvulae conniventes (also known as Kerckring folds or plicae circulares) is a distinguishing feature of the small bowel. These anatomical folds become more prominent when the small bowel is distended, helping to differentiate it from the large bowel, which has a smoother appearance.\n\n3. **Air-Fluid Levels**: On upright abdominal radiographs, multiple air-fluid levels can be observed within the dilated loops of the small bowel. These levels may vary in height and can be greater than 2.5 cm, indicating the presence of fluid within the bowel.\n\n4. **Radiographic Views**: A supine abdominal X-ray will show multiple dilated loops of small bowel, while an upright view will reveal the characteristic air-fluid levels. The combination of these views aids in confirming the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.\n\n5. **Coiled-Spring Appearance**: The dilated loops may exhibit a "coiled-spring" appearance due to the prominent valvulae conniventes, which is a classic sign of small bowel obstruction.\n\nIn summary, the identification of dilated small bowel loops on X-ray involves assessing their central location, size, the presence of valvulae conniventes, and the observation of air-fluid levels, particularly in upright views. These features are crucial for diagnosing conditions such as small bowel obstruction.
