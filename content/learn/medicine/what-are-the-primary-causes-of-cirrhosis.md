    What are the primary causes of cirrhosis?
answer: >-
    The primary causes of cirrhosis can vary based on geographic location and underlying health conditions. In the United States, the most common causes include:\n\n1. **Hepatitis C**: A viral infection that leads to chronic liver inflammation and damage.\n2. **Alcohol-associated liver disease**: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis.\n3. **Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: This condition, often associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol, can progress to cirrhosis.\n\nIn the developing world, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are more prevalent causes of cirrhosis. Other notable causes of cirrhosis include:\n\n- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: A condition where the immune system attacks liver cells.\n- **Primary biliary cholangitis**: A chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver.\n- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis**: A disease that causes scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts.\n- **Hemochromatosis**: An inherited disorder that causes excessive iron accumulation in the body.\n- **Wilson disease**: A genetic disorder that leads to copper accumulation in the liver and other organs.\n- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**: A genetic condition that can lead to liver disease.\n- **Budd-Chiari syndrome**: A condition caused by obstruction of the hepatic veins.\n- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Certain medications and herbal supplements can cause liver damage.\n- **Chronic right-sided heart failure**: This can lead to liver congestion and damage.\n\nOverall, while chronic viral infections and alcohol use are the leading causes in many regions, a variety of other conditions can also contribute to the development of cirrhosis.
