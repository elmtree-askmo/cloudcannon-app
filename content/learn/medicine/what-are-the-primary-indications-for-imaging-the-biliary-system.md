    What are the primary indications for imaging the biliary system?
answer: >-
    The primary indications for imaging the biliary system encompass a variety of clinical scenarios. These include:\n\n1. **Acute Cholecystitis**: This is one of the most common indications for imaging, particularly using hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) which can help confirm the diagnosis.\n\n2. **Functional Biliary Pain Syndromes**: Imaging is indicated for both adults and pediatric populations experiencing unexplained biliary pain.\n\n3. **Biliary System Patency**: Assessing the patency of the biliary system is crucial, especially in cases of suspected obstruction or after surgical procedures.\n\n4. **Bile Leakage**: Imaging can help identify any leaks in the biliary system, which may occur post-surgery or due to trauma.\n\n5. **Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia**: Differentiating between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis syndrome is essential, and imaging plays a key role in this assessment.\n\n6. **Assessment of Biliary Enteric Bypass**: For example, evaluating the results of a Kasai procedure or other surgical interventions.\n\n7. **Liver Transplant Assessment**: Imaging is used to evaluate the biliary anatomy and function in liver transplant recipients.\n\n8. **Choledochal Cysts**: Imaging helps in the diagnosis and management of these congenital anomalies.\n\n9. **Biliary Stent Patency**: Ensuring that stents placed in the biliary system are functioning properly.\n\n10. **Gallbladder Ejection Fraction**: This functional assessment can be performed to evaluate gallbladder function.\n\n11. **Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction**: Imaging can assist in diagnosing this condition, which affects the flow of bile.\n\n12. **Evaluation of Hepatocyte Tumors**: Imaging is crucial for assessing liver tumors and their relationship to the biliary system.\n\nThese indications highlight the importance of imaging in diagnosing and managing various conditions affecting the biliary system, ensuring appropriate treatment and intervention when necessary.
