    The cardiac cycle consists of phases like atrial systole, isovolumetric contraction, ventricular ejection, isovolumetric relaxation, ventricular filling, and diastole, regulating blood circulation and heart function.

    What are the different phases of the cardiac cycle?
answer: >-
    The cardiac cycle is a sequence of events that occurs during a single heartbeat, encompassing both contraction and relaxation phases of the heart. It consists of several distinct phases:\n\n1. **Atrial Systole**: This phase marks the contraction of the atria, pushing blood into the ventricles. It occurs at the end of diastole when the ventricles are filled with blood.\n\n2. **Isovolumetric Contraction**: Following atrial systole, the ventricles begin to contract. During this phase, the pressure in the ventricles rises, but the volume remains constant because all heart valves are closed. This phase prepares the ventricles for the ejection of blood.\n\n3. **Ventricular Ejection**: In this phase, the pressure in the ventricles exceeds that in the aorta and pulmonary artery, causing the semilunar valves to open. Blood is ejected from the ventricles into the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\n\n4. **Isovolumetric Relaxation**: After ventricular ejection, the ventricles begin to relax. The semilunar valves close, and the volume of blood in the ventricles remains constant as all valves are again closed. This phase allows the pressure in the ventricles to drop.\n\n5. **Ventricular Filling**: As the ventricles relax, the atrioventricular (AV) valves open, allowing blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles. This phase includes both passive filling and, towards the end, active filling due to atrial contraction.\n\n6. **Diastole**: This is the overall relaxation phase of the heart, during which the heart chambers fill with blood. It encompasses the phases of ventricular filling and atrial systole.\n\nThe cardiac cycle is crucial for maintaining effective blood circulation throughout the body, and it is regulated by the heart's electrical conduction system, which coordinates the timing of these phases.
