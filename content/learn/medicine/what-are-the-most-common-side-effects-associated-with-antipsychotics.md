    What are the most common side effects associated with antipsychotics?
answer: >-
    Antipsychotics are a class of medications used primarily to manage psychosis, including conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While they can be effective in treating these conditions, they are also associated with a range of side effects, which can vary depending on whether the antipsychotic is a first-generation (typical) or second-generation (atypical) drug.\n\n### Common Side Effects of Antipsychotics\n\n1. **Sedation**: Many antipsychotics have sedative properties, leading to drowsiness and fatigue.\n\n2. **Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)**: This is particularly common with first-generation antipsychotics and includes:\n   - **Akathisia**: A feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion.\n   - **Dystonia**: Involuntary muscle contractions that can cause twisting and repetitive movements.\n   - **Tardive Dyskinesia**: A potentially irreversible condition characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, often affecting the face and tongue.\n   - **Parkinsonism**: Symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, such as tremors and rigidity.\n\n3. **Anticholinergic Effects**: These can include dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision, particularly with low-potency dopamine receptor antagonists like chlorpromazine and thioridazine.\n\n4. **Metabolic Effects**: Atypical antipsychotics are often associated with weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and an increased risk of diabetes mellitus.\n\n5. **Sexual Dysfunction**: Many patients report issues such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and other sexual side effects.\n\n6. **Orthostatic Hypotension**: A drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can lead to dizziness and falls.\n\n7. **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)**: A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by severe muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability, and altered mental status.\n\n8. **Cardiac Issues**: Some antipsychotics can lead to QTc prolongation, which increases the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n9. **Agranulocytosis**: A potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cells, which can increase the risk of infections.\n\n10. **Other Effects**: These may include sialorrhea (excessive salivation), weight gain, and cognitive impairments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile not everyone will experience these side effects, they can range from mild to severe and may significantly impact a patient's quality of life. It is essential for individuals taking antipsychotics to be monitored by healthcare professionals to manage any adverse effects effectively. If side effects become overwhelming, patients should consult their healthcare provider to discuss potential adjustments to their treatment plan.
