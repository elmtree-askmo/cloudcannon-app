    How do combining forms differ from word roots?
answer: >-
    Combining forms and word roots are both essential components of medical terminology, but they serve different purposes in the construction of medical terms.\n\n1. **Word Root**: The word root is the core part of a medical term that provides its fundamental meaning. Each medical term contains at least one word root, which is often derived from Greek or Latin. For example, the word root "hepat" refers to the liver.\n\n2. **Combining Form**: A combining form is created when a word root is combined with a combining vowel, which is typically the letter "o" but can also be "i." The combining vowel is used to facilitate pronunciation, especially when the word root is followed by another word part that begins with a consonant. For instance, the combining form "hepat/o" (where "o" is the combining vowel) allows for easier pronunciation when combined with suffixes or other roots, such as in "hepatitis."\n\nIn summary, the primary difference is that a word root provides the essential meaning of the term, while a combining form includes the word root plus a combining vowel, enabling smoother pronunciation and the formation of more complex medical terms. For example, "hepat/o" (combining form) can be used in terms like "hepatomegaly" (enlargement of the liver), whereas "hepat" alone would not be sufficient for such constructions.
