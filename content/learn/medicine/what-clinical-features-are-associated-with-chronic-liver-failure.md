    What clinical features are associated with chronic liver failure?
answer: >-
    Chronic liver failure is characterized by a range of clinical features that arise due to the liver's inability to perform its normal functions effectively. As the disease progresses, these symptoms can become more pronounced. Here are some of the key clinical features associated with chronic liver failure:\n\n1. **Jaundice**: This is a common symptom where the skin and the whites of the eyes take on a yellowish hue, typically occurring when serum bilirubin levels exceed 50 Âµmol/L. Jaundice can be present in both acute and chronic liver diseases.\n\n2. **Fatigue**: Patients often experience significant fatigue and weakness, which can be debilitating and affect daily activities.\n\n3. **Dark Urine**: The urine may appear darker than usual due to increased bilirubin excretion.\n\n4. **Ascites**: Fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity is a common complication of chronic liver failure, leading to abdominal swelling and discomfort.\n\n5. **Loss of Appetite and Weight Loss**: Patients may experience a decreased appetite, leading to unintentional weight loss over time.\n\n6. **Itching (Pruritus)**: This can occur due to the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream.\n\n7. **Spider Angiomas**: These are small, spider-like blood vessels that can appear on the skin, particularly on the upper body.\n\n8. **Palmar Erythema**: This refers to redness of the palms, which can be a sign of liver dysfunction.\n\n9. **Bleeding Tendencies**: Patients may experience easy bruising or bleeding due to impaired synthesis of clotting factors.\n\n10. **Cognitive Changes**: As liver function declines, patients may develop hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as confusion, altered consciousness, or even coma in severe cases.\n\n11. **Complications of Cirrhosis**: Chronic liver failure often leads to cirrhosis, which can result in further complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and increased risk of liver cancer.\n\nThese clinical features highlight the systemic impact of chronic liver failure on the body, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management to prevent progression to more severe liver disease.
