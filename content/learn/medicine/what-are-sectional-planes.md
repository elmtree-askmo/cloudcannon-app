    What are sectional planes?
answer: >-
    Sectional planes, also known as anatomical planes, are imaginary two-dimensional surfaces that are used to divide the body into different sections for the purpose of anatomical study and description. Understanding these planes is crucial in fields such as medicine and healthcare, particularly when analyzing images from imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans.\n\nThere are three primary sectional planes commonly referenced in anatomy:\n\n1. **Sagittal Plane**: This vertical plane divides the body into right and left parts. If the division is made exactly in the midline, it is referred to as the midsagittal plane. Any other sagittal plane that is parallel to the midsagittal plane divides the body into unequal right and left portions.\n\n2. **Coronal Plane (Frontal Plane)**: This vertical plane divides the body into anterior (front) and posterior (back) sections. It runs parallel to the long axis of the body and is particularly useful for describing sections through the skull.\n\n3. **Transverse Plane (Axial Plane)**: This horizontal plane divides the body into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) portions. It is often used to create cross-sectional images of the body, allowing for a view of internal structures.\n\nThese planes facilitate clear communication regarding the location and movement of body structures, making them essential for anatomical terminology and medical practice. Understanding sectional planes is fundamental for anyone entering a healthcare field, as they provide a framework for describing the orientation and relationships of various anatomical features.
