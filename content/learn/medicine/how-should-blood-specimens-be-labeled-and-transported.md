    When labeling and transporting blood specimens, it is essential to follow established guidelines to ensure the integrity of the samples and accurate test results. Here are the key practices to consider:\n\n### Labeling Blood Specimens\n1. **Accurate Information**: Each blood sample must be labeled with critical patient information, including:\n   - Patient's name\n   - Date of birth\n   - Medical record number\n   - Date and time of collection\n   - Type of specimen (e.g., serum, plasma)\n\n2. **Verification**: It is crucial to verify all labels and associated paperwork for correctness to prevent sample misidentification, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses and treatment.\n\n3. **Biohazard Labeling**: Specimens should be placed in containers that are clearly labeled with biohazard symbols to indicate the presence of potentially infectious materials.\n\n### Transporting Blood Specimens\n1. **Temperature Control**: Blood specimens, especially those that are temperature-sensitive, must be maintained at specific temperatures during transport to preserve their integrity. Avoid exposing samples to extreme temperatures.\n\n2. **Leak-Proof Containers**: According to OSHA standards, blood specimens must be placed in containers that prevent leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage, transport, and shipping.\n\n3. **Avoid Agitation**: Do not shake or agitate blood specimens during transport, as this can lead to hemolysis, which may interfere with test results.\n\n4. **Order of Draw**: Ensure that blood samples are collected in the correct order of draw to prevent cross-contamination of additives from different tubes.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Maintain accurate documentation throughout the transport process, including tracking the chain of custody and ensuring that all specimens are accounted for.\n\n6. **Compliance with Regulations**: Follow all local, state, and federal regulations regarding the transportation of blood specimens to ensure safety and compliance.\n\n7. **Packaging**: Use appropriate containers and packaging materials designed to withstand temperature variations and physical impacts. This may include specialized transport containers or biohazard bags.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices for labeling and transporting blood specimens, healthcare professionals can help ensure the accuracy and reliability of laboratory test results, ultimately contributing to better patient care.
