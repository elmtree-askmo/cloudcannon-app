    How is urine formed in the human body?
answer: >-
    Urine formation in the human body occurs through a complex process that involves three main steps: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion.\n\n1. **Glomerular Filtration**: This initial step takes place in the glomerulus, a network of capillaries located within the nephron. As blood flows through the glomerulus, blood pressure forces water and small solutes (such as glucose, sodium, and urea) through a filtration membrane into the Bowman's capsule, forming a fluid known as glomerular filtrate. This process removes a significant volume of fluid and solutes from the blood, with approximately 140-170 liters of filtrate produced daily.\n\n2. **Tubular Reabsorption**: Following filtration, the glomerular filtrate moves into the renal tubules, where essential substances are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This occurs primarily in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), where about 65% of filtered water, glucose, amino acids, and various ions are reabsorbed. The reabsorption process is selective, ensuring that vital nutrients and a significant portion of water are retained, while waste products remain in the filtrate.\n\n3. **Tubular Secretion**: The final step involves the secretion of additional waste products and excess ions from the blood into the renal tubules. This process helps regulate the chemical composition of the blood and excretes harmful substances, such as drugs and metabolic byproducts. The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is primarily responsible for this secretion.\n\nThe combination of these processes results in the formation of urine, which is then transported to the bladder for storage before being excreted from the body. In a healthy adult, the kidneys typically produce about 1-2 liters of urine per day, reflecting the body's need to maintain homeostasis and eliminate waste products effectively.
