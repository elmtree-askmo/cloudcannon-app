    What are the common causes of hemianopia and quadrantanopia?
answer: >-
    Hemianopia and quadrantanopia are visual field deficits that can arise from various neurological conditions, primarily due to damage to specific areas of the brain involved in visual processing.\n\n### Common Causes of Hemianopia\nThe most prevalent cause of hemianopia is stroke, particularly ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes that affect the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain. Other significant causes include:\n\n1. **Brain Tumors**: Tumors can exert pressure on the optic pathways or brain regions responsible for visual processing.\n2. **Traumatic Brain Injury**: Severe head trauma can lead to damage in the visual pathways, resulting in hemianopia.\n3. **Inflammation**: Conditions that cause inflammation in the brain, such as multiple sclerosis, can also lead to visual field deficits.\n4. **Optic Nerve Damage**: Any injury or disease affecting the optic nerves can result in hemianopia.\n\nLess common causes may include infections or congenital conditions affecting the visual pathways.\n\n### Common Causes of Quadrantanopia\nQuadrantanopia, which refers to the loss of vision in one-quarter of the visual field, is often associated with lesions in the brain. The primary causes include:\n\n1. **Stroke**: Similar to hemianopia, strokes can lead to quadrantanopia, particularly when they affect the occipital lobe or the optic radiations.\n2. **Traumatic Brain Injury**: Injuries that impact the brain can also result in quadrantanopia.\n3. **Lesions in the Occipital Lobe**: These are the most common cause of quadrantanopia, as they directly affect the visual processing areas.\n4. **Lesions in the Temporal and Parietal Lobes**: While less common, lesions in these areas can also lead to quadrantanopia, particularly affecting the optic radiations.\n\nIn summary, both hemianopia and quadrantanopia are primarily caused by strokes, brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries, with specific brain lesions playing a crucial role in the manifestation of these visual field deficits.
