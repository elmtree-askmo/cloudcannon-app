    How is obscure gastrointestinal bleeding identified?
answer: >-
    Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is identified as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract that persists or recurs after initial evaluations, which typically include bidirectional endoscopy (upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) and radiologic imaging, such as small-bowel radiographs. This type of bleeding accounts for approximately 5% of all clinically evident gastrointestinal bleeding cases and is often attributed to sources in the small intestine.\n\nThe identification process for OGIB involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Initial Evaluation**: The first step is to conduct a thorough evaluation using standard endoscopic techniques. If these do not reveal a source of bleeding, the condition is classified as obscure.\n\n2. **Advanced Imaging Techniques**: Following a negative initial evaluation, advanced imaging techniques are employed. Capsule endoscopy has become a gold standard for diagnosing small bowel bleeding, allowing for visualization of the entire small intestine. Deep enteroscopy, including double-balloon enteroscopy, is also utilized to directly visualize and potentially treat lesions in the small bowel.\n\n3. **Cross-Sectional Imaging**: In addition to capsule endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) enterography can help identify potential sources of bleeding.\n\n4. **Angiography**: This technique can be useful for localizing active bleeding and diagnosing vascular lesions that may not be visible through endoscopy.\n\n5. **Repeat Endoscopy**: In some cases, repeat upper endoscopy and/or colonoscopy may be warranted, as studies have shown that a significant percentage of obscure GI bleeds may originate from areas accessible by these procedures.\n\n6. **Clinical History and Physical Examination**: A detailed clinical history and physical examination are essential to guide the diagnostic process and to formulate a differential diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors.\n\nIn summary, the identification of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding involves a systematic approach that includes initial endoscopic evaluations, advanced imaging techniques, and careful clinical assessment to uncover the underlying cause of the bleeding.
