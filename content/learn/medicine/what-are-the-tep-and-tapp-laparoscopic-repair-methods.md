    What are the TEP and TAPP laparoscopic repair methods?
answer: >-
    The TEP (Totally Extraperitoneal) and TAPP (Transabdominal Preperitoneal) techniques are two standard laparoscopic methods used for the repair of inguinal hernias. Both approaches are minimally invasive and involve small incisions in the abdomen, but they differ in their surgical techniques and the spaces they utilize during the procedure.\n\n### TAPP (Transabdominal Preperitoneal) Technique\nIn the TAPP approach, the surgeon accesses the abdominal cavity through the peritoneum. The procedure involves creating a space between the abdominal wall and the peritoneum, allowing the surgeon to visualize the hernia defect and surrounding structures. A mesh is then placed over the hernia defect to reinforce the abdominal wall. One of the advantages of TAPP is the enhanced visualization it provides, which may help reduce the risk of complications, such as bladder injury. Additionally, TAPP has a slightly lower risk of conversion to another hernia repair method compared to TEP, with an anticipated risk of about 7 conversions per 1000 participants.\n\n### TEP (Totally Extraperitoneal) Technique\nIn contrast, the TEP technique is performed entirely within the preperitoneal space, without entering the peritoneal cavity. This approach avoids potential complications associated with peritoneal violation. The surgeon creates a working space in the preperitoneal area to repair the hernia, typically using mesh as well. While TEP may carry a higher risk of conversion to another repair method (approximately 25 conversions per 1000 participants), it is favored for certain patients, particularly those with recurrent hernias or in cases where avoiding peritoneal entry is beneficial.\n\n### Comparison and Considerations\nBoth TEP and TAPP have been shown to be effective in the repair of inguinal hernias, with similar outcomes to open surgical techniques when performed by trained surgeons. The choice between TEP and TAPP may depend on the surgeon's expertise, the specific characteristics of the hernia, and patient factors. Studies have indicated that while both techniques are safe, there are conflicting reports regarding the advantages of one over the other, and the decision often comes down to individual patient circumstances and surgeon preference.\n\nIn summary, both TEP and TAPP are valuable laparoscopic techniques for inguinal hernia repair, each with its own set of advantages and considerations.
