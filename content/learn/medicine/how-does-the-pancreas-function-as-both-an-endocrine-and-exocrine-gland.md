    How does the pancreas function as both an endocrine and exocrine gland?
answer: >-
    The pancreas is a unique organ that functions as both an endocrine and exocrine gland, playing a crucial role in digestion and metabolic regulation.\n\n### Exocrine Function\nThe exocrine portion of the pancreas constitutes about 85-99% of its mass and is primarily responsible for the production and secretion of digestive enzymes. These enzymes include amylase, lipase, and proteases, which are released into the duodenum of the small intestine to aid in the digestion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. The exocrine pancreas also secretes bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid, creating an optimal pH for enzyme activity. This secretion is regulated by hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin, which are released in response to food intake.\n\n### Endocrine Function\nIn contrast, the endocrine portion of the pancreas, known as the islets of Langerhans, comprises about 1-15% of the pancreas and is responsible for the production of hormones that regulate blood glucose levels. The islets contain several types of cells:\n- **Alpha cells** produce glucagon, which raises blood glucose levels when they are low.\n- **Beta cells** produce insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels when they are high.\n- **Delta cells** secrete somatostatin, which regulates the secretion of both insulin and glucagon.\n\nThe release of these hormones is tightly regulated by blood glucose levels. For instance, when blood glucose levels rise after a meal, beta cells secrete insulin to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells, while glucagon secretion is inhibited. Conversely, when blood glucose levels drop, alpha cells release glucagon to stimulate the liver to release stored glucose.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the pancreas serves dual roles: as an exocrine gland, it aids in digestion through the secretion of digestive enzymes into the small intestine; as an endocrine gland, it regulates blood sugar levels through the secretion of hormones like insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. This dual functionality is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the body.
