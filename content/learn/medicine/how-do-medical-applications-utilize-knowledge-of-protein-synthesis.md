    How do medical applications utilize knowledge of protein synthesis?
answer: >-
    Medical applications utilize knowledge of protein synthesis in several significant ways, particularly in the development of therapeutic proteins and peptides, which have emerged as crucial treatment options for various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.\n\n1. **Therapeutic Proteins and Peptides**: Many well-known drugs are proteins or peptides, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), Adalimumab (Humira), and Insulin Glargine (Lantus). These therapeutic agents are often target-specific, exhibiting high activity and low toxicity. Approximately 70% of protein drugs are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, which are favored for their ability to perform post-translational modifications necessary for protein functionality. However, some proteins can be toxic to these cell hosts, leading to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS).\n\n2. **Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS)**: CFPS offers a solution to the toxicity issues associated with certain proteins. This method allows for the synthesis of proteins without the need for living cells, thus enabling the production of toxic proteins in a controlled environment. CFPS systems can be based on cell lysates or purified components, and they can maintain high activity levels even after long-term preservation through lyophilization techniques.\n\n3. **Nanocarriers and Drug Delivery**: Advances in synthetic biology have led to the development of engineered nanoparticles and nanocarriers, such as protein-PEG nanocarriers. These nanoparticles can be used for imaging solid tumors and delivering drugs effectively, improving the therapeutic effects and half-life of drugs. For instance, engineered bacterial outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) can be utilized to transport biochemicals to target cells, enhancing the efficacy of treatments.\n\n4. **Targeting Protein Synthesis in Cancer**: The regulation of protein synthesis is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in cancer biology. Dysregulation of translation factors can lead to enhanced protein synthesis, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to therapies. For example, alterations in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway can significantly affect protein translation and cell proliferation in various cancers. Targeting these pathways offers potential therapeutic strategies to combat cancer.\n\n5. **Biomarkers and Diagnostics**: Understanding protein synthesis and its dysregulation can also lead to the identification of biomarkers for diseases. For instance, changes in translation factors and ribosomal components can serve as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in cancers, providing insights into disease progression and treatment responses.\n\nIn summary, the knowledge of protein synthesis is pivotal in the medical field, influencing the development of therapeutic proteins, innovative drug delivery systems, and targeted cancer therapies, while also providing avenues for diagnostics and personalized medicine.
