    What is the Shouldice repair technique?
answer: >-
    The Shouldice repair technique is a well-established method for the surgical management of inguinal hernias, developed by Dr. Edward Earle Shouldice in the 1940s. This technique is notable for its use of natural tissue rather than synthetic mesh, making it a non-mesh repair option. The Shouldice technique is based on the earlier Bassini repair but incorporates several modifications that enhance its effectiveness.\n\nKey features of the Shouldice repair include:\n\n1. **Tissue Repair**: The technique focuses on reinforcing the abdominal wall using the patient's own tissue. This approach has been shown to result in lower recurrence rates compared to other non-mesh repairs.\n\n2. **Surgical Technique**: The procedure begins with a thorough exposure and evaluation of the inguinal anatomy. Surgeons meticulously approximate the surrounding tissue around the hernia defect and repair the posterior wall of the inguinal canal using permanent sutures.\n\n3. **Success Rates**: Reports from the Shouldice Hospital in Canada indicate that the failure rates for this technique are consistently under 1%, which has contributed to its reputation as a gold standard in hernia surgery.\n\n4. **Patient Outcomes**: Most patients experience mild to moderate pain in the initial days following surgery, and many can avoid prescription pain medications. The technique is also beneficial in identifying and addressing potential hidden hernias, which can reduce the need for subsequent surgeries.\n\n5. **Guidelines and Recommendations**: According to the 2018 HerniaSurge guidelines, the Shouldice repair is considered the best non-mesh suture repair for inguinal hernias and is strongly recommended for specific patient populations, such as young males with lateral hernias.\n\nOverall, the Shouldice repair technique is recognized for its effectiveness and safety, making it a preferred choice for many surgeons and patients dealing with inguinal hernias.
