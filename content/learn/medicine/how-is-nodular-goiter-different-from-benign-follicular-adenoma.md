    How is nodular goiter different from benign follicular adenoma?
answer: >-
    Nodular goiter and benign follicular adenoma are both conditions related to the thyroid gland, but they have distinct characteristics.\n\n1. **Nodular Goiter**: This condition refers to the presence of one or more nodules within the thyroid gland, which can be a result of hyperplasia (an increase in the number of cells) and involution (a decrease in the size of the gland). A nodular goiter can be classified as a multinodular goiter when multiple nodules are present. The nodules in a goiter may vary in size and can lack a thick capsule. Histologically, nodular goiter is characterized by variably sized dilated follicles with flattened hyperplastic epithelium, and it may show secondary changes such as hemorrhage, fibrosis, and calcification.\n\n2. **Benign Follicular Adenoma**: This is a specific type of benign thyroid nodule that is typically encapsulated and solitary. Follicular adenomas can be more challenging to differentiate from malignant lesions based on imaging and biopsy results. They are characterized by a well-defined capsule and consist of follicular cells that resemble normal thyroid tissue but are arranged in a more organized manner. The size of a follicular adenoma can vary significantly, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in the encapsulation and histological features: a benign follicular adenoma is usually a solitary, encapsulated nodule, while a nodular goiter may consist of multiple nodules that are not necessarily encapsulated and can show a variety of histological changes. Additionally, the management and diagnostic approaches may differ, as follicular adenomas require careful evaluation to rule out malignancy, while nodular goiters may often be monitored without immediate intervention unless symptomatic.
