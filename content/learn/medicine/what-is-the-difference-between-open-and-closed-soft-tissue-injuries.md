    What is the difference between open and closed soft tissue injuries?
answer: >-
    The primary difference between open and closed soft tissue injuries lies in the integrity of the skin and the exposure of underlying tissues. \n\n1. **Open Soft Tissue Injuries**: These injuries occur when the protective barrier of the skin is broken, allowing for exposure of the underlying tissues to the external environment. This can lead to bleeding and a higher risk of infection, as foreign materials can enter the wound. Examples of open soft tissue injuries include lacerations, abrasions, and puncture wounds.\n\n2. **Closed Soft Tissue Injuries**: In contrast, closed soft tissue injuries occur without any break in the skin. The skin remains intact, but there may be damage to the underlying tissues, such as muscles, tendons, or ligaments. Common types of closed soft tissue injuries include contusions (bruises), hematomas (localized bleeding outside of blood vessels), and crush injuries. Although there is no external bleeding, closed injuries can still result in internal bleeding and swelling beneath the skin.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that open injuries involve a breach in the skin, while closed injuries do not, despite potentially significant internal damage.
