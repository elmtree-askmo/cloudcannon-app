answer: >-
    Overt gastrointestinal bleeding refers to visible bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, which can manifest in several ways. It is classified as acute bleeding and is characterized by the presence of blood that is apparent to the patient or healthcare provider. The common presentations of overt GI bleeding include:\n\n1. **Hematochezia**: This is the passage of fresh, red blood through the anus, which may indicate bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the colon or rectum.\n\n2. **Melena**: This refers to black, tarry stools that result from the digestion of blood, typically indicating bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach or duodenum.\n\n3. **Hematemesis**: This is the vomiting of blood, which can appear bright red or have a "coffee-ground" appearance if the blood has been partially digested.\n\nThe symptoms of overt GI bleeding can vary depending on the location and severity of the bleeding. Patients may also experience additional symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or signs of anemia, particularly if the bleeding is significant or prolonged.\n\nIn clinical practice, patients presenting with overt GI bleeding are often admitted for urgent evaluation and management, which may include endoscopic procedures to identify and treat the source of the bleeding. The management strategies will depend on the severity of the bleeding and the underlying cause.
