    How is the inferior border established in radiation treatment fields?
answer: >-
    In radiation treatment for breast cancer, the establishment of the inferior border of the treatment field is crucial for effective targeting of the cancerous tissue while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy structures. The inferior border is typically defined as being 2 cm below the inframammary fold, which is the crease under the breast. This positioning helps ensure that the radiation adequately covers the area of interest, particularly in cases where the patient has undergone a unilateral mastectomy, as the inferior border may also be influenced by the position of the contralateral breast.\n\nIn addition to the inferior border, the medial and lateral borders of the treatment field are generally aligned with the midsternum and midaxillary lines, respectively. This configuration is designed to encompass the axillary nodes while sparing as much healthy tissue as possible. In cases where a supraclavicular field is utilized, the inferior border of the tangential field is matched with the superior border of the supraclavicular field to ensure continuity in treatment coverage.\n\nOverall, careful planning and precise delineation of these borders are essential components of radiation therapy for breast cancer, contributing to the effectiveness of the treatment while minimizing potential side effects.
