    Which sites are most commonly affected by embolism in acute limb ischemia?
answer: >-
    In acute limb ischemia, the most commonly affected sites by embolism are the common femoral artery and the popliteal artery. These locations are particularly vulnerable because emboli often lodge at arterial bifurcations, which are points where blood vessels split into two or more branches. \n\nEmbolism accounts for approximately 30% of cases of acute limb ischemia, with the majority of embolic events originating from the heart or from other proximal sources, such as diseased large vessels or aneurysms. The common femoral bifurcation is the primary site for embolic occlusion, followed by the popliteal trifurcation, which is less commonly affected.\n\nIn summary, the common femoral artery and popliteal artery are the key sites where embolism typically occurs in cases of acute limb ischemia.
