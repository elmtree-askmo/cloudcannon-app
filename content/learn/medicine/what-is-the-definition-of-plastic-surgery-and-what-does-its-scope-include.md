    What is the definition of plastic surgery and what does its scope include?
answer: >-
    Plastic surgery is defined as a branch of surgery that focuses on the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It encompasses a wide range of medical procedures aimed at improving both the function and appearance of various body parts. The term "plastic" in plastic surgery is derived from the ancient Greek word "plastikos," which means to mold or give form, rather than referring to artificial materials.\n\nThe scope of plastic surgery can be broadly categorized into two main types: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. \n\n1. **Reconstructive Surgery**: This type of surgery is performed to correct deformities or restore function due to congenital defects, trauma, or medical conditions. It includes a variety of specialties such as craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. Reconstructive procedures aim to restore both the appearance and functionality of affected areas.\n\n2. **Cosmetic Surgery**: This branch focuses on enhancing a person's appearance through surgical and non-surgical techniques. Common cosmetic procedures include breast augmentation, liposuction, rhinoplasty (nose reshaping), and facial rejuvenation techniques. While cosmetic surgery is often highlighted in public perception, it is important to note that reconstructive surgery plays a crucial role in the overall field of plastic surgery.\n\nOverall, plastic surgery addresses a wide array of conditions and procedures, including but not limited to congenital abnormalities, traumatic injuries, and aesthetic enhancements. It involves various surgical techniques and principles, including wound closure techniques, flap and graft techniques, and considerations for patient selection and psychological factors. Ethical considerations also play a significant role in the practice of plastic surgery, ensuring that procedures are performed with the patient's best interests in mind.
