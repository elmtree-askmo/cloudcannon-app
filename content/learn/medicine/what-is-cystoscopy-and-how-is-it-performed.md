    What is cystoscopy and how is it performed?
answer: >-
    Cystoscopy is a medical procedure that allows a doctor to examine the inside of the bladder and urethra using a cystoscope, which is a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and a lens or small video camera. This procedure is typically performed to diagnose various urinary tract issues, including bladder cancer, obstructions, and infections.\n\n### How Cystoscopy is Performed\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before the procedure, patients are usually asked to empty their bladder. They may change into a surgical gown and lie down on a treatment table, typically in a supine or lithotomy position.\n\n2. **Anesthesia**: Cystoscopy can be performed using different types of anesthesia. A local anesthetic jelly is often applied to numb the urethra. In some cases, especially for children or anxious patients, sedation or general anesthesia may be used.\n\n3. **Insertion of the Cystoscope**: The doctor gently inserts the cystoscope through the urethra and into the bladder. This is similar to the insertion of a Foley catheter, which is used to drain urine.\n\n4. **Examination**: Once the cystoscope is in place, the doctor can view the interior of the bladder and urethra. This allows for the detection of abnormalities such as tumors, inflammation, or blockages.\n\n5. **Additional Procedures**: If necessary, therapeutic procedures can also be performed during cystoscopy, such as taking biopsies or removing small stones.\n\n6. **Post-Procedure Care**: After the cystoscopy, patients may experience mild discomfort or a burning sensation during urination. It is important to follow up with the doctor to discuss the results and any further steps.\n\nCystoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that provides valuable insights into urinary tract health and is an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of urologic conditions.
