    What are the most common treatment options for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)?
answer: >-
    The treatment options for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) vary based on the stage of the cancer, the patient's liver function, and overall health. Here are the most common treatment options:\n\n1. **Surgical Treatments**:\n   - **Hepatectomy**: This involves the surgical removal of the tumor along with a portion of the liver. It is typically considered for patients with a single tumor and well-preserved liver function.\n   - **Liver Transplantation**: This is an option for patients with early-stage HCC who also have significant liver disease (such as cirrhosis). It allows for the removal of the cancerous liver and replacement with a healthy liver.\n\n2. **Ablation Techniques**:\n   - **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)** and **Microwave Ablation (MWA)**: These techniques use heat to destroy cancer cells and are often used for small tumors that are not amenable to surgery.\n   - **Ethanol Injection**: This involves injecting alcohol directly into the tumor to induce cell death.\n\n3. **Liver-Directed Therapies**:\n   - **Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)**: This procedure delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver tumor while blocking its blood supply, which can help shrink the tumor.\n   - **Radioembolization**: This involves injecting radioactive beads into the blood vessels feeding the tumor, delivering targeted radiation therapy.\n\n4. **Systemic Therapies**:\n   - For advanced HCC, systemic therapies are the mainstay of treatment. Historically, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors like **sorafenib** and **lenvatinib** were the primary first-line treatments. However, recent advancements have introduced immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as **atezolizumab** and **bevacizumab** in combination therapy, which have shown promising results in clinical trials.\n\n5. **Clinical Trials**: Patients may also be encouraged to participate in clinical trials exploring new treatment options, which can provide access to cutting-edge therapies.\n\nThe choice of treatment is highly individualized and should be made in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, considering the specific characteristics of the tumor and the patient's overall health status.
