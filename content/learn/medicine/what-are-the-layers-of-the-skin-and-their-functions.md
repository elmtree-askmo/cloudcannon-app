    What are the layers of the skin and their functions?
answer: >-
    The skin is the body's largest organ and is composed of three primary layers, each serving distinct functions:\n\n1. **Epidermis**: This is the outermost layer of the skin, primarily responsible for creating a protective barrier. It consists mainly of keratinocytes, which make up about 90% of the epidermis and are crucial for its structure and barrier functions. The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. The epidermis is further divided into five sub-layers, with the stratum corneum being the topmost layer that provides the first line of defense against external agents.\n\n2. **Dermis**: Located beneath the epidermis, the dermis is a fibrous layer that supports and strengthens the epidermis. It contains essential structures such as blood vessels, lymph vessels, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and nerve endings. The dermis plays a vital role in thermoregulation through vasoconstriction and vasodilation of blood vessels, and it provides nutrients and oxygen to the skin.\n\n3. **Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Tissue)**: This is the deepest layer of the skin, situated below the dermis. The hypodermis consists of loose connective tissue and fat, which serves to insulate the body, store energy, and provide cushioning against external impacts. It also helps anchor the skin to underlying structures, such as muscles and bones.\n\nTogether, these layers work to protect the body from environmental threats, regulate temperature, prevent water loss, and facilitate sensory perception. The skin's structure and functions are essential for maintaining overall health and well-being.
