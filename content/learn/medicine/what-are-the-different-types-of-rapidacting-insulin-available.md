answer: >-
    Rapid-acting insulin is a type of insulin that begins to work approximately 15 minutes after injection, peaks in about one to two hours, and lasts for about two to four hours. It is primarily used to control blood sugar levels during meals and to correct high blood sugar levels. The following are the different types of rapid-acting insulin available:\n\n1. **Insulin Aspart**:\n   - **Brand Names**: Fiasp, NovoLog, Trurapi\n   - Onset: 5 to 15 minutes\n   - Peak: 1 to 2 hours\n   - Duration: 4 to 6 hours\n\n2. **Insulin Glulisine**:\n   - **Brand Name**: Apidra\n   - Onset: Similar to insulin aspart\n   - Peak: 1 to 2 hours\n   - Duration: 4 to 6 hours\n\n3. **Insulin Lispro**:\n   - **Brand Names**: Admelog, Humalog, Lyumjev\n   - Onset: Similar to insulin aspart\n   - Peak: 1 to 2 hours\n   - Duration: 4 to 6 hours\n\n4. **Afrezza**:\n   - This is an inhaled form of rapid-acting insulin that acts even faster than injected forms, with a peak effect occurring in about 15 to 20 minutes and lasting for approximately 2 to 3 hours. It requires specific training for use.\n\nThese rapid-acting insulins are often used in conjunction with longer-acting insulins to provide comprehensive blood sugar control, especially for individuals with diabetes who require insulin therapy.
