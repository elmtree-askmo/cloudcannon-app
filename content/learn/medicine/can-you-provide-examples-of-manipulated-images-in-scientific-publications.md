answer: >-
    Manipulated images in scientific publications have become a significant concern within the research community, particularly due to the potential for misrepresentation and ethical violations. Here are some notable examples and cases of manipulated images:\n\n1. **Woo Suk Hwang Case (2005)**: This high-profile case involved South Korean researcher Woo Suk Hwang, who was found guilty of research misconduct, including image manipulation and data fabrication in his work on embryonic stem cells. His 2004 paper claimed to have successfully established embryonic stem-cell lines, but subsequent investigations revealed significant ethical breaches and manipulation of images.\n\n2. **Rossner and Yamada (2004)**: The publication by Rossner and Yamada in the Journal of Cell Biology highlighted the issues surrounding image manipulation in scientific research. This article provided an overview of the problem from an editorial perspective and emphasized the need for integrity in scientific imaging.\n\n3. **Retractions in 2023**: In 2023, several papers were retracted due to image manipulation, including a Cell paper from 1999 and two Science papers from 2001. These cases illustrate the ongoing challenges and scrutiny regarding the integrity of scientific images.\n\n4. **General Trends**: Research has shown that more than 50% of manipulated papers were not supported by the US government, indicating that funding sources may influence the prevalence of image manipulation. Additionally, a growing number of misconduct cases handled by the Office of Research Integrity involve various forms of image manipulation, such as altering specific features or misrepresenting images.\n\n5. **Ethical Guidelines**: The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) has provided guidelines for handling suspicions of image manipulation, emphasizing the importance of pre-publication screening and adherence to journal-specific guidelines. This includes the use of forensic technologies to detect alterations and ensure the authenticity of published images.\n\nThese examples underscore the critical need for ethical standards and practices in the manipulation of scientific images, as well as the potential consequences of failing to maintain integrity in research publications.
