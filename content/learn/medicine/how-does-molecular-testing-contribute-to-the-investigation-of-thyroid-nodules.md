    How does molecular testing contribute to the investigation of thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Molecular testing plays a significant role in the investigation of thyroid nodules, particularly in the context of indeterminate nodules, which account for approximately 10-15% of thyroid nodule biopsies. These nodules present a diagnostic challenge because their cytological results do not clearly indicate whether they are benign or malignant.\n\nThe primary objective of molecular testing in this context is to reduce unnecessary diagnostic surgeries by providing additional information about the risk of malignancy associated with these nodules. By analyzing mutations in DNA or changes in RNA expression, molecular tests can help predict whether a nodule is benign or malignant. This is particularly important as it allows for better triage of nodules, enabling healthcare providers to identify which nodules can be monitored and which should be surgically resected.\n\nSeveral molecular testing modalities have been developed, including direct mutation analysis, mRNA gene expression profiling, and next-generation sequencing. Among these, RNA tests and DNA-RNA tests have shown high validation rates for diagnosing indeterminate thyroid nodules. For instance, a 7-gene panel has been identified as a reliable "rule in" test, demonstrating high specificity and positive predictive value for distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules.\n\nThe incorporation of molecular testing into clinical practice has been endorsed by major guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Thyroid Association. Studies have shown that about 90% of patients with benign molecular test results can be managed nonoperatively, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgeries for over 25,000 patients annually.\n\nIn summary, molecular testing enhances the diagnostic accuracy for thyroid nodules, particularly indeterminate ones, and significantly impacts management decisions, ultimately leading to more individualized treatment plans and reduced overtreatment of low-risk malignancies.
