    What were the early developments in medical technology in the United States?
answer: >-
    The early developments in medical technology in the United States were characterized by a gradual evolution from rudimentary practices to more structured and scientifically informed approaches. Initially, medical care in the U.S. lacked a solid foundation in scientific knowledge, leading to many harmful treatments. For instance, common practices included bloodletting and other techniques that are now considered barbaric (Rothstein, 1987).\n\nIn the late 18th century, significant milestones began to emerge. For example, in 1784, Benjamin Franklin invented bifocal eyeglasses, which allowed physicians to practice more effectively by addressing both near and far vision problems with a single pair of glasses. This innovation marked an early intersection of technology and medical practice (10).\n\nThe 19th century saw further advancements, including the establishment of the first American medical society, the Creole Societe Medicale de la Nouvelle-New Orleans, in 1817. This period also witnessed the professionalization of medicine, with the founding of medical schools and the introduction of formal medical education, which laid the groundwork for future advancements in medical technology (1, 2).\n\nBy the mid-19th century, notable figures such as Elizabeth Blackwell, who became the first American woman to receive a medical degree in 1849, and David Jones Peck, the first African American medical school graduate in 1847, contributed to the diversification and expansion of the medical profession (4).\n\nThe acceptance of germ theory in the late 19th century revolutionized medical practices, leading to improved sanitation and the development of vaccines, such as the first vaccine for cholera in 1879 and anthrax in 1881. These advancements were pivotal in shaping modern medical technology and public health initiatives (2, 4).\n\nOverall, the early developments in medical technology in the United States were marked by a transition from unscientific practices to a more organized and evidence-based approach, setting the stage for the complex medical industrial system that would evolve in the 20th century and beyond.
