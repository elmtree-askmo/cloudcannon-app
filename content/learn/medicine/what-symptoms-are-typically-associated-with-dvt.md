    What symptoms are typically associated with DVT?
answer: >-
    Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs. Symptoms of DVT can vary, and notably, about half of the individuals with DVT may not exhibit any symptoms at all. However, when symptoms do occur, they typically include:\n\n1. **Swelling**: The affected leg may experience swelling, particularly in the calf or thigh.\n2. **Pain or Tenderness**: There may be throbbing pain or tenderness in the affected area, which is often felt in the calf or thigh. This pain may worsen when walking or standing.\n3. **Skin Changes**: The skin over the affected area may appear red or discolored.\n4. **Warmth**: The area around the clot may feel warmer than the surrounding skin.\n\nIn some cases, if a DVT leads to a pulmonary embolism (PE), symptoms may escalate to include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. It is crucial to seek medical attention if DVT is suspected, as it can lead to serious complications.
