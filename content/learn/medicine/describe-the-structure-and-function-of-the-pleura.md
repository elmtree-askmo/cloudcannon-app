    Describe the structure and function of the pleura.
answer: >-
    The pleura are essential membranes that surround the lungs, consisting of two distinct layers: the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura. \n\n1. **Visceral Pleura**: This is the inner layer that directly adheres to the surface of the lungs. It is responsible for providing a protective covering and plays a role in the lung's expansion and contraction during breathing.\n\n2. **Parietal Pleura**: This outer layer lines the thoracic cavity, including the chest wall and the diaphragm. It serves to anchor the lungs in place and provides a barrier between the lungs and the surrounding structures.\n\n3. **Pleural Cavity**: The space between the visceral and parietal pleura is known as the pleural cavity. This cavity contains pleural fluid, which is crucial for several reasons:\n   - **Friction Reduction**: The pleural fluid acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between the lung surfaces and the chest wall during the respiratory cycle. This is vital for smooth lung movement as the lungs expand and contract.\n   - **Pressure Maintenance**: The pleural fluid helps maintain negative pressure within the pleural cavity, which is essential for lung inflation. This negative pressure allows the lungs to expand effectively during inhalation.\n\nOverall, the structure of the pleura and the pleural cavity is vital for efficient respiratory function, protecting the lungs, and facilitating the mechanics of breathing.
