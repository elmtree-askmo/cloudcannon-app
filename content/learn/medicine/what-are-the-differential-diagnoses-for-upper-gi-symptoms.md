    What are the differential diagnoses for upper GI symptoms?
answer: >-
    The differential diagnoses for upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can be quite extensive, particularly when these symptoms present acutely. It is crucial to consider various factors such as the site, character, onset, duration, severity, radiation, and any exacerbating or relieving factors related to the pain. Here are some key conditions to consider:\n\n1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: This is one of the most common causes of upper GI symptoms, particularly epigastric pain or burning. Peptic ulcers can lead to complications such as bleeding or perforation.\n\n2. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Characterized by symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, GERD can cause significant discomfort and may lead to esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus if untreated.\n\n3. **Gastritis**: Inflammation of the stomach lining can present with upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n4. **Esophageal Disorders**: Conditions such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, or esophageal cancer can manifest as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or chest pain.\n\n5. **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, along with nausea and vomiting.\n\n6. **Biliary Disorders**: Conditions such as cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis (bile duct stones) can present with upper abdominal pain, especially in the right upper quadrant, and may be associated with jaundice.\n\n7. **Functional Dyspepsia**: This is a common condition characterized by symptoms of discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen without any identifiable organic cause.\n\n8. **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and early satiety.\n\n9. **Upper GI Bleeding**: This can be caused by various factors, including peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, or malignancies. Symptoms may include hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black, tarry stools).\n\n10. **Perforated Viscus**: A surgical emergency that can present with acute abdominal pain and requires immediate intervention.\n\nIt is important to conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history and physical examination, to narrow down the differential diagnoses and identify any 'red flags' that may indicate serious pathology.
