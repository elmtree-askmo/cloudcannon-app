    How does meniscus preservation impact the overall function of the knee joint?
answer: >-
    Meniscus preservation significantly impacts the overall function of the knee joint by maintaining its structural integrity and biomechanical properties. The menisci, which are C-shaped cartilaginous structures in the knee, play several critical roles, including:\n\n1. **Load Distribution**: The menisci help distribute weight and reduce the stress on the articular cartilage during activities such as walking, running, and jumping. This load distribution is essential for preventing localized cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis.\n\n2. **Stability**: The menisci contribute to the stability of the knee joint by deepening the joint surface and improving the fit between the femur and tibia. This stability is crucial during dynamic movements and helps prevent injuries.\n\n3. **Shock Absorption**: The menisci act as shock absorbers, cushioning the knee joint from impacts and reducing the risk of injury to the cartilage and underlying bone.\n\n4. **Lubrication and Nutrition**: The menisci facilitate the movement of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint and provides nutrients to the articular cartilage, promoting its health and longevity.\n\n5. **Proprioception**: The menisci contain sensory nerve endings that contribute to proprioception, the bodyâ€™s ability to sense its position and movement. This function is vital for coordination and balance.\n\nPreserving the meniscus, especially in younger and more active individuals, is crucial for long-term joint health. Repairing meniscal tears rather than opting for meniscectomy (removal of the meniscus) can lead to better clinical outcomes, including reduced pain and improved knee function. Studies have shown that meniscus preservation techniques, such as orthobiologics and collagen scaffold augmentation, can enhance healing and maintain the meniscus's functional roles.\n\nIn summary, meniscus preservation is essential for maintaining knee joint function, preventing degenerative changes, and ensuring a better quality of life for individuals, particularly those who are active or involved in sports. The decision to preserve or remove meniscal tissue can have lasting implications on joint health and functionality.
