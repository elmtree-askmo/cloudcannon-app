    What are the common differential diagnoses for dysphagia?
answer: >-
    The differential diagnoses for dysphagia can be categorized based on the phase of swallowing affectedâ€”either oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. Here are some common causes:\n\n### Oropharyngeal Dysphagia\nThis type of dysphagia involves difficulty in the transfer of the food bolus from the mouth to the esophagus. Common causes include:\n- **Neurological Disorders**: Conditions such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and dementia can impair the muscles involved in swallowing.\n- **Structural Abnormalities**: This includes pharyngeal or esophageal webs, pharyngeal pouches, and foreign bodies.\n- **Muscle Disorders**: Neuromuscular disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myasthenia gravis can lead to oropharyngeal dysphagia.\n- **Chronic Conditions**: Poor dentition, dry mouth (xerostomia), and adverse effects from medications can exacerbate swallowing difficulties.\n\n### Esophageal Dysphagia\nThis type involves difficulty in the passage of food through the esophagus. Common causes include:\n- **Mechanical Obstruction**: This can be intrinsic (within the esophagus) such as:\n  - Reflux esophagitis with stricture formation\n  - Carcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cardia\n  - Schatzki ring\n  - Eosinophilic esophagitis, which is an inflammatory condition triggered by food allergens.\n- **Extrinsic Compression**: Tumors or other structures outside the esophagus can compress it and cause dysphagia.\n- **Functional Esophageal Disorders**: Conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to dysphagia even in the absence of visible mucosal damage.\n\n### Other Considerations\n- **Globus Sensation**: This is a sensation of a lump in the throat that is distinct from dysphagia and may be associated with functional disorders.\n- **Medication Effects**: Certain medications can cause dysphagia through direct mucosal injury or impaired motility.\n\n### Conclusion\nA thorough history and clinical evaluation are essential to distinguish between these causes and to guide further diagnostic testing, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or barium esophagography, to identify the underlying pathology.
