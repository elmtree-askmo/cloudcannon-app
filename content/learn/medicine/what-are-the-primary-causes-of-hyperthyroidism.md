    What are the primary causes of hyperthyroidism?
answer: >-
    The primary causes of hyperthyroidism include:\n\n1. **Graves' Disease**: This is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, particularly in the United States and other Western countries. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system produces antibodies that overstimulate the thyroid gland, leading to excessive production of thyroid hormones. It predominantly affects young to middle-aged women and tends to run in families.\n\n2. **Toxic Multinodular Goiter**: Also known as Plummer's disease, this condition occurs when multiple nodules in the thyroid gland become overactive and produce excess thyroid hormones. It is more common in older adults.\n\n3. **Toxic Adenoma**: This condition involves a single overactive thyroid nodule (adenoma) that produces excess thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.\n\n4. **Painless Thyroiditis**: This is a temporary condition that can occur after childbirth (postpartum thyroiditis) or as a result of certain medications. It involves inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can lead to a transient increase in thyroid hormone levels.\n\n5. **Gestational Hyperthyroidism**: This occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy due to the stimulatory effects of placental beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) on the thyroid gland.\n\n6. **Rare Causes**: Other less common causes of hyperthyroidism include TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas, metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, and struma ovarii.\n\nOverall, hyperthyroidism is significantly more prevalent in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 20:1. Understanding these causes is crucial for effective diagnosis and management of the condition.
