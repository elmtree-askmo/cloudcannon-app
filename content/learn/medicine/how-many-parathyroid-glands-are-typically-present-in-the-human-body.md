    How many parathyroid glands are typically present in the human body?
answer: >-
    Humans typically have four parathyroid glands. These small endocrine glands are usually located on the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland, with two glands situated superiorly and two inferiorly. While the standard number is four, variations can occur; supernumerary parathyroid glands have been identified in up to 13% of autopsies, indicating that some individuals may have more than the typical four glands.
