    What are the primary causes and risk factors for peptic ulcer disease?
answer: >-
    Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is primarily caused by two main factors: infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n### Primary Causes of Peptic Ulcer Disease:\n1. **Helicobacter pylori Infection**: \n   - H. pylori is a gram-negative bacillus that colonizes the gastric epithelial cells. It is a common cause of peptic ulcers, with nearly half of the world's population being infected. This bacterium can survive in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach and is responsible for damaging the stomach lining, leading to ulcer formation.\n\n2. **NSAID Use**: \n   - The use of NSAIDs, including over-the-counter medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, significantly increases the risk of developing peptic ulcers. Long-term use of these medications can raise the risk of ulcer formation by up to 20 times compared to non-users. NSAIDs can inhibit the production of protective gastric mucus, making the stomach lining more susceptible to damage from gastric acid.\n\n### Risk Factors for Peptic Ulcer Disease:\n- **Previous History of Ulcers**: Individuals with a history of peptic ulcers are at a higher risk for recurrence.\n- **Gastrointestinal Bleeding**: A prior episode of gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant risk factor for developing further ulcers.\n- **Smoking**: Smoking has been shown to impair the healing of existing ulcers and increase the risk of developing new ones.\n- **Alcohol Consumption**: Excessive alcohol intake can irritate the stomach lining and contribute to ulcer formation.\n- **Stress**: While stress was once thought to be a primary cause of ulcers, it is now understood to be a contributing factor rather than a direct cause.\n\nOverall, the combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use accounts for the majority of peptic ulcer cases, while other risk factors can exacerbate the condition. Understanding these causes and risk factors is crucial for prevention and management of peptic ulcer disease.
