    What is the incidence and typical presentation of renal cell carcinoma?
answer: >-
    Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of all renal cancers. It is a significant health concern, with an incidence that has been rising globally, particularly in developed countries. In 2020, there were over 430,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide, making renal cancer the 14th most common malignancy. The incidence rates are notably higher in Europe and North America, which may be attributed to factors such as advanced imaging techniques and an increased prevalence of modifiable risk factors like smoking, obesity, and hypertension.\n\nThe typical presentation of renal cell carcinoma can vary, but many patients are asymptomatic, with more than 50% diagnosed incidentally during imaging for unrelated issues. When symptoms do occur, they may include:\n\n- **Gross hematuria**: This is the most common clinical presentation, reported in approximately 40% to 66% of cases.\n- **Flank pain**: Also reported in about 40% of patients.\n- **Palpable mass**: Present in around 25% of cases.\n- **Classic triad**: The combination of hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable mass is now less common and often indicates advanced disease.\n\nOther symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever of unknown origin, and in advanced cases, signs such as varicocele or lower extremity edema due to venous obstruction. The mean age of diagnosis is typically around 52 years, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 3:2.\n\nDiagnosis is often confirmed through imaging studies such as CT or MRI, and occasionally through biopsy. The most common histological subtype of RCC is clear cell carcinoma, which accounts for 80% to 90% of cases.\n\nIn summary, renal cell carcinoma is a prevalent malignancy with a rising incidence, characterized by a range of clinical presentations, primarily hematuria, flank pain, and incidental findings during imaging.
