    What diagnostic methods are used for gastroparesis?
answer: >-
    Gastroparesis, a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying, is diagnosed through a combination of patient history, physical examination, and specific diagnostic tests. Here are the primary methods used for diagnosing gastroparesis:\n\n1. **Gastric Emptying Scintigraphy**: This is the most reliable and commonly used test for diagnosing gastroparesis. During this test, the patient consumes a meal that contains a small amount of radioactive material. Imaging equipment is then used to track the rate at which the stomach empties. If more than 10% of the food remains in the stomach four hours after eating, it indicates gastroparesis.\n\n2. **Stable Isotope Breath Test**: This test involves the use of a stable isotope (such as 13C-spirulina) to evaluate gastric emptying. It is considered a reliable alternative to scintigraphy, although it is recommended with a conditional recommendation due to low quality of evidence.\n\n3. **Wireless Motility Capsule**: This is a non-invasive test that measures gastric emptying and can provide information about the entire gastrointestinal tract. The capsule is swallowed and transmits data as it moves through the digestive system.\n\n4. **Imaging Tests**: Other imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may be used to rule out physical obstructions in the stomach that could mimic gastroparesis symptoms.\n\n5. **Blood Tests**: While not specific for gastroparesis, blood tests can help identify dehydration, malnutrition, or infections that may be associated with the condition.\n\n6. **Physical Examination and Medical History**: A thorough physical exam and detailed medical history are crucial. The healthcare provider will assess symptoms and may look for signs such as abdominal distention or tenderness.\n\nIn summary, the diagnosis of gastroparesis typically relies on gastric emptying studies, particularly scintigraphy, along with a comprehensive evaluation of symptoms and medical history.
