    What are the functions of ovum and sperm cells in reproduction?
answer: >-
    In human reproduction, the ovum (egg cell) and sperm cells play crucial and complementary roles. \n\n### Functions of the Ovum\n1. **Female Gamete**: The ovum is the female gamete, which is non-motile and released from the ovaries during ovulation. It is capable of developing into a new organism when fertilized by a sperm cell.\n2. **Nourishment**: The ovum contains essential nutrients in its cytoplasm that support early fetal development. These nutrients nourish the blastocyst until it can implant into the uterine wall.\n3. **Genetic Contribution**: The ovum contributes half of the genetic material necessary for the formation of a zygote, which is the fertilized egg that will develop into an embryo.\n4. **Activation of Sperm**: The ovum plays a role in activating the metabolism of the sperm, which is essential for successful fertilization.\n\n### Functions of Sperm Cells\n1. **Male Gamete**: Sperm cells, or spermatozoa, are the male gametes that deliver genetic material to the ovum. They are motile and travel through the female reproductive tract to reach the egg.\n2. **Fertilization**: The primary function of sperm is to unite with the ovum, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote. This union is crucial for initiating the development of a new organism.\n3. **Genetic Contribution**: Sperm cells provide the other half of the genetic material required for the zygote, ensuring genetic diversity and continuity.\n4. **Activation of Ovum**: Sperm also activate the metabolism of the ovum, which is necessary for the onset of embryonic development after fertilization.\n\n### Fertilization Process\nFertilization occurs primarily in the ampulla of the fallopian tube, where the sperm and ovum meet. Upon successful fusion, the genetic material from both the sperm and ovum combines to form a zygote, marking the beginning of embryonic development.\n\nIn summary, the ovum and sperm cells are essential for reproduction, each contributing unique functions that facilitate the creation of a new organism.
