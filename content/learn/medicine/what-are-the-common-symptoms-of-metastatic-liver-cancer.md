    What are the common symptoms of Metastatic Liver Cancer?
answer: >-
    Metastatic liver cancer, also known as stage 4 liver cancer, occurs when cancer that originated in another part of the body spreads to the liver. The symptoms of metastatic liver cancer can vary widely depending on the location of the primary cancer and the extent of the spread. Common symptoms include:\n\n1. **Abdominal Pain**: This is often the most common initial symptom. Patients may experience discomfort or pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n2. **Weight Loss**: Unintentional weight loss is frequently reported and can be a sign of advanced disease.\n\n3. **Loss of Appetite**: Many individuals may experience a decreased desire to eat, which can contribute to weight loss.\n\n4. **Nausea and Vomiting**: These symptoms can occur as the disease progresses.\n\n5. **Fatigue and Weakness**: General feelings of tiredness and weakness are common in patients with metastatic liver cancer.\n\n6. **Abdominal Swelling**: This may be due to fluid accumulation (ascites) or an enlarged liver.\n\n7. **Jaundice**: Yellowing of the skin and eyes can occur if the liver is significantly affected.\n\n8. **Hepatomegaly**: The liver may become enlarged, hard, or tender, and in advanced cases, massive hepatomegaly with easily palpable nodules may be present.\n\n9. **Fever**: Some patients may experience fever as part of their symptoms.\n\nIt's important to note that many individuals with liver metastases may not exhibit any symptoms in the early stages, and when symptoms do appear, they can often be nonspecific. This can make it challenging to recognize the disease until it has progressed significantly.
