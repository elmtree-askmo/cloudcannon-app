    Shoulder periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are classified based on criteria established by the 2018-2019 International Consensus Meeting, utilizing a scoring system with major and minor criteria, and further refined by the PJI-TNM classification introduced in 2020.

    How are shoulder PJIs classified according to international consensus?
answer: >-
    According to the international consensus established during the 2018-2019 International Consensus Meeting (ICM) on Orthopedic Infections, shoulder periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are classified using a scoring system that includes both major and minor criteria. This classification aims to provide a standardized approach to diagnosing shoulder PJIs, which can be particularly challenging in clinical practice.\n\nThe ICM criteria were developed through a systematic review and a Delphi process, leading to a refined definition of shoulder PJI. The consensus reached during the meeting indicated a strong agreement among delegates, with 88% in favor of the proposed criteria.\n\nAdditionally, a newer classification system known as the "PJI-TNM classification" was introduced in 2020. This system is modeled after the traditional oncological TNM classification and is designed to capture the complexity, severity, and diversity of PJIs. It considers various factors such as the onset of symptoms, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations, thereby enhancing the understanding and management of these infections.\n\nIn summary, shoulder PJIs are classified based on criteria established by the ICM, which includes a scoring system of major and minor criteria, and further refined by the PJI-TNM classification to address the complexities involved in diagnosing and managing these infections.
