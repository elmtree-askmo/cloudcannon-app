    What are the key features of hepatic cysts and hemangiomas on ultrasound?
answer: >-
    On ultrasound, hepatic cysts and hemangiomas exhibit distinct features that aid in their diagnosis:\n\n### Hepatic Cysts\n1. **Appearance**: Hepatic cysts typically appear as well-circumscribed, anechoic lesions. This means they do not reflect ultrasound waves, resulting in a dark appearance on the ultrasound image.\n2. **Posterior Enhancement**: They demonstrate increased through-transmission of sound, known as posterior acoustic enhancement, which occurs because the fluid within the cyst allows sound waves to pass through more easily.\n3. **Lack of Solid Components**: There is no evidence of mural nodularity or solid components within the cyst, which helps differentiate them from other cystic lesions.\n4. **Clinical Associations**: Familiarity with the clinical context and laboratory findings can assist in distinguishing between different types of cystic lesions, such as simple cysts versus echinococcal cysts.\n\n### Hepatic Hemangiomas\n1. **Appearance**: Hepatic hemangiomas are usually seen as hyperechoic (bright) lesions on ultrasound. They can be well-circumscribed and may present a uniform echogenicity or appear as hypoechoic masses with a hyperechoic rim.\n2. **Histological Basis**: The hyperechoic nature of hemangiomas is attributed to their histological composition, which consists of large blood-filled cavernous spaces.\n3. **Doppler Ultrasound**: Duplex Doppler ultrasound may reveal various flow patterns, including arterial and venous signals, which can further assist in the diagnosis and follow-up of hemangiomas.\n\nThese ultrasound characteristics are crucial for radiologists in establishing a definitive diagnosis or providing a reasonable differential diagnosis for hepatic lesions.
