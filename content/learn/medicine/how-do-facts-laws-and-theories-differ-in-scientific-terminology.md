    How do facts, laws, and theories differ in scientific terminology?
answer: >-
    In scientific terminology, facts, laws, and theories represent different levels of understanding and explanation regarding natural phenomena. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each:\n\n1. **Facts**: Facts are observations that can be independently verified and are accepted as true based on empirical evidence. They are the building blocks of scientific knowledge. For example, the observation that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level is a fact.\n\n2. **Laws**: Scientific laws describe consistent and universal relationships between phenomena, often expressed mathematically. They summarize observed behaviors and can predict outcomes under specific conditions without explaining why those phenomena occur. For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation mathematically describes the attraction between two masses, allowing predictions about their motion.\n\n3. **Theories**: A scientific theory is a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a substantial body of evidence that has been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experimentation. Theories integrate multiple hypotheses and provide a broader understanding of related phenomena. For example, the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life through mechanisms such as natural selection and genetic drift. Unlike laws, theories address the "why" behind phenomena and can evolve as new evidence emerges.\n\nIn summary, while facts are the observations that form the basis of scientific inquiry, laws describe the relationships between those observations, and theories provide the overarching explanations that connect and interpret the facts and laws. Together, they form a hierarchical structure that underpins scientific knowledge and understanding.
