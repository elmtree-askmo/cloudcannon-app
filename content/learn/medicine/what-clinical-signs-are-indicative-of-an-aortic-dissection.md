    What clinical signs are indicative of an aortic dissection?
answer: >-
    Clinical signs indicative of an aortic dissection include:\n\n1. **Sudden Onset of Severe Chest Pain**: Patients often describe the pain as sharp, tearing, or ripping, typically located in the chest or back. This pain may migrate as the dissection progresses.\n\n2. **Radiating Pain**: The pain may radiate to the neck, shoulders, or abdomen, depending on the location of the dissection.\n\n3. **Differences in Blood Pressure**: There may be a significant difference in blood pressure readings between the arms, indicating compromised blood flow.\n\n4. **Neurological Symptoms**: If the dissection affects arteries supplying the brain, patients may experience symptoms such as confusion, weakness, or loss of consciousness.\n\n5. **Acute Limb Ischemia**: If the dissection compromises blood flow to the limbs, signs may include coldness, pallor, or weakness in the affected limb.\n\n6. **Signs of Shock**: Patients may present with hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of end-organ dysfunction due to compromised blood flow.\n\n7. **Heart Murmurs**: In some cases, a new murmur may be detected due to aortic regurgitation resulting from the dissection.\n\n8. **Other Symptoms**: Patients may also experience shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.\n\nDiagnosis is typically confirmed through imaging techniques such as CT angiography, which can visualize the dissection and assess its extent. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent serious complications, including organ ischemia and death.
