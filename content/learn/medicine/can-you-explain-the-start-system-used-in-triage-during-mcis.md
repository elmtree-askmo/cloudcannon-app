    The S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) system is a widely used triage method in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) that allows emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to quickly assess and prioritize patients based on the severity of their injuries. Developed by Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach, California, the S.T.A.R.T. system categorizes patients into four color-coded categories, which helps responders determine the order in which patients should receive care.\n\nThe four triage categories in the S.T.A.R.T. system are:\n\n1. **Immediate (Red)**: Patients in this category have life-threatening injuries but can be treated and transported immediately. They require urgent medical attention to survive.\n\n2. **Delayed (Yellow)**: These patients have serious injuries that are not immediately life-threatening. They can wait for treatment without a significant risk to their lives.\n\n3. **Minor (Green)**: Patients in this category have minor injuries and can wait for treatment. They are often referred to as "walking wounded."\n\n4. **Deceased (Black)**: This category is for patients who are not breathing or have injuries that are incompatible with life. They are not expected to survive even with medical intervention.\n\nThe S.T.A.R.T. system emphasizes rapid assessment, which typically involves checking the patient's ability to breathe, circulation, and mental status. This quick evaluation allows responders to efficiently sort patients and allocate resources effectively, ultimately improving survival rates in chaotic situations.\n\nIn practice, the S.T.A.R.T. method is crucial for ensuring that the most critical patients receive timely care while also managing the overall flow of treatment in an MCI scenario. The use of color-coded triage tags helps to visually communicate the patient's status to all responders on the scene, facilitating organized and effective patient management.
