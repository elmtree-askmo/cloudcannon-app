    What is the primary function of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the body?
answer: >-
    The primary function of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is to regulate water balance in the body. It is produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. ADH plays a crucial role in promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys. \n\nWhen ADH levels are elevated, the kidneys reabsorb more water from the urine back into the bloodstream, resulting in concentrated urine and decreased urine output. This mechanism helps to conserve water in the body, particularly during states of dehydration or increased plasma osmolality. Conversely, when ADH levels are low, the kidneys reabsorb less water, leading to dilute urine and increased urine output, which is commonly observed in conditions such as Diabetes Insipidus.\n\nIn summary, ADH is essential for maintaining fluid balance and regulating sodium concentration in the body by controlling the amount of water reabsorbed by the kidneys.
