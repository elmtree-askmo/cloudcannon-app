    How does non-Hodgkin's lymphoma differ from Hodgkin's lymphoma?
answer: >-
    Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are two distinct types of lymphomas, which are cancers of the lymphatic system. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Cellular Characteristics**:\n   - **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: This type is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal lymphocytes. The presence of these cells is a defining feature that helps in diagnosing Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n   - **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: In contrast, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma does not contain Reed-Sternberg cells. It encompasses a diverse group of over 60 subtypes of lymphomas, which can vary significantly in their cellular characteristics.\n\n2. **Predictability and Behavior**:\n   - **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: Generally, Hodgkin's lymphoma is considered more predictable in its progression and is often more curable with treatment. It typically follows a more orderly pattern of spread, often starting in lymph nodes and then spreading to adjacent nodes.\n   - **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: This type is less predictable and can be either aggressive (fast-growing) or indolent (slow-growing). The behavior of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can vary widely among its subtypes, making it more complex to treat.\n\n3. **Symptoms**:\n   - Both types may present with similar symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), fever, night sweats, and weight loss. However, the specific symptoms and their severity can differ based on the subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n4. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the prognosis is generally favorable.\n   - **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma**: Treatment can include chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy, depending on the specific subtype and stage of the disease. The response to treatment can vary significantly among patients.\n\n5. **Epidemiology**:\n   - Hodgkin's lymphoma is more common in young adults and has a bimodal age distribution, while non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is more prevalent in older adults and has a broader age range.\n\nIn summary, the primary differences between Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma lie in their cellular characteristics, predictability, treatment responses, and epidemiological patterns. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning.
