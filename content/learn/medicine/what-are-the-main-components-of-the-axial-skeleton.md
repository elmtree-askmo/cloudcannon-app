    What are the main components of the axial skeleton?
answer: >-
    The axial skeleton is a major division of the human skeletal system, consisting of 80 bones that form the central axis of the body. The main components of the axial skeleton include:\n\n1. **Skull**: Comprising 28 bones, the skull includes the cranial bones that protect the brain and the facial bones that form the structure of the face. The skull also contains the ossicles of the middle ear, which are essential for hearing.\n\n2. **Vertebral Column**: This consists of 26 bones, including the vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord and provides structural support for the body.\n\n3. **Rib Cage (Thoracic Cage)**: Formed by the ribs and the sternum, the rib cage protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs and assists in the mechanics of breathing.\n\n4. **Hyoid Bone**: Located in the throat, the hyoid bone supports the tongue and is involved in swallowing.\n\nThese components work together to support and protect the central nervous system and vital organs within the thorax, while also providing attachment points for muscles that facilitate movement and respiration.
