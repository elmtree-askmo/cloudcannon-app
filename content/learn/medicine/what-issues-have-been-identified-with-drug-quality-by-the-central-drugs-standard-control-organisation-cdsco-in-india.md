    What issues have been identified with drug quality by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India?
answer: >-
    The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India has identified significant issues with drug quality, flagging over 50 medications for failing to meet safety and quality standards. This includes well-known drugs such as paracetamol, Pantocid (used for acid reflux), and various antibiotics. The CDSCO's alerts have raised serious safety concerns regarding the consumption of these medications.\n\nIn its recent reports, the CDSCO issued two lists: one containing 48 drugs that failed quality tests and another with 5 drugs categorized as "Not of Standard Quality" (NSQ Alert). The majority of the flagged drugs were produced in Himachal Pradesh, highlighting widespread quality issues across the pharmaceutical industry in India.\n\nSome specific examples of the drugs flagged include:\n- Pantocid tablets\n- Pulmosil injection (for high blood pressure)\n- Ursocol 300 tablets\n- Vitamin D3 supplements (Shelcal)\n- Anti-diabetic drug glimepiride\n- Various vitamin supplements\n\nThe CDSCO conducts routine tests across the country, and the monthly alerts serve to inform the public and healthcare professionals about the safety and efficacy of medications available in the market. The identification of these quality failures has prompted alarm among medical leaders and raised questions about the regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical sector in India.
