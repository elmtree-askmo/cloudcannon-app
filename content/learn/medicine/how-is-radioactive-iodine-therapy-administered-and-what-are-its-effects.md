    How is radioactive iodine therapy administered and what are its effects?
answer: >-
    Radioactive iodine therapy (RAI), also known as radioiodine therapy or I-131 treatment, is a common treatment for hyperthyroidism and certain types of thyroid cancer. The therapy is administered in either capsule or liquid form, which the patient ingests. Once inside the body, the radioactive iodine is absorbed primarily by the thyroid gland, where it emits radiation that destroys thyroid cells, including both healthy and cancerous cells.\n\n### Administration of Radioactive Iodine Therapy\n1. **Preparation**: Before undergoing RAI therapy, patients are typically required to follow an iodine-free diet for at least seven days. This helps to increase the effectiveness of the treatment by ensuring that the thyroid gland is more likely to absorb the radioactive iodine.\n2. **Dosage**: The dosage of radioactive iodine is determined based on the patient's specific condition, thyroid function, and the extent of the disease. In some cases, multiple doses may be administered, especially if the disease recurs or spreads.\n3. **Safety Precautions**: After treatment, patients must take precautions to minimize radiation exposure to others, particularly pregnant women and young children. This includes maintaining a safe distance from others for a period of time.\n\n### Effects of Radioactive Iodine Therapy\n- **Destruction of Thyroid Tissue**: The primary effect of RAI therapy is the destruction of thyroid tissue, which can lead to a permanent cure for hyperthyroidism. However, this often results in hypothyroidism, necessitating lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy (e.g., levothyroxine) to maintain normal hormone levels.\n- **Success Rates**: RAI therapy has high success rates, with studies indicating a cure rate of approximately 87.7% after a single dose for hyperthyroidism.\n- **Side Effects**: Common short-term side effects may include tenderness in the thyroid area, while long-term effects often include the development of hypothyroidism. Regular monitoring of thyroid hormone levels is essential post-treatment to manage any potential complications.\n\nIn summary, radioactive iodine therapy is a well-established treatment for certain thyroid disorders, particularly hyperthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer. While it is generally effective, it can lead to permanent changes in thyroid function, requiring ongoing management.
