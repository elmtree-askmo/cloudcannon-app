    What is the role of EUS in pancreatic imaging?
answer: >-
    Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) plays a crucial role in pancreatic imaging, particularly in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic neoplasms, which can range from benign to malignant lesions. Here are some key aspects of EUS in pancreatic imaging:\n\n1. **High Sensitivity**: EUS is recognized as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting pancreatic lesions, especially small masses (â‰¤2 cm). Studies have shown that EUS has a pooled sensitivity of over 95% for this purpose, making it superior to other imaging techniques like CT and MRI in certain cases.\n\n2. **Detailed Imaging**: EUS provides high-resolution spatial imaging of the pancreas due to the integration of an ultrasound transducer at the tip of a flexible endoscope. This allows for detailed visualization of pancreatic structures and lesions, which is particularly beneficial for identifying subtle changes that may not be visible with other imaging modalities.\n\n3. **Tissue Acquisition**: One of the significant advantages of EUS is its ability to facilitate tissue diagnosis through fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and fine-needle biopsy (FNB). This capability allows for better histological characterization of pancreatic lesions, aiding in the differentiation between malignant and non-malignant conditions.\n\n4. **Therapeutic Applications**: EUS has evolved from a primarily diagnostic tool to one that also offers therapeutic interventions. It can be used to drain cysts, deliver medications directly to targeted areas, and perform other minimally invasive procedures.\n\n5. **Differentiation of Conditions**: EUS is effective in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from other non-malignant conditions that may present with similar imaging features. It can also identify pancreatic cysts larger than 30 mm and assess the presence of masses in surrounding tissues.\n\n6. **Role in Chronic Pancreatitis**: EUS is also valuable in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis, as it can detect both subtle and severe changes in the pancreatic duct and parenchyma, contributing to a comprehensive evaluation of pancreatic health.\n\nIn summary, EUS is an essential tool in the imaging and management of pancreatic diseases, offering high sensitivity, detailed imaging capabilities, and the ability to perform therapeutic interventions, thereby enhancing both diagnosis and treatment planning.
