    What are the common causes and symptoms of kidney stones?
answer: >-
    Kidney stones, also known as renal calculi, are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. They can vary in size and may cause significant pain and discomfort when they move through the urinary tract. \n\n### Common Causes of Kidney Stones\nKidney stones often have multiple contributing factors, including:\n\n1. **High Levels of Minerals**: Elevated concentrations of calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus in the urine can lead to stone formation. These minerals are typically present in urine but can become problematic at high levels.\n2. **Dietary Factors**: Consuming a diet high in animal proteins (such as beef, poultry, pork, eggs, and fish) can increase the risk of uric acid stones. Additionally, excessive intake of oxalate-rich foods (like spinach, nuts, and chocolate) can contribute to calcium-oxalate stones.\n3. **Metabolic Conditions**: Certain metabolic disorders, such as renal tubular acidosis, can predispose individuals to specific types of stones.\n4. **Dehydration**: Insufficient fluid intake can lead to concentrated urine, increasing the likelihood of stone formation.\n5. **Medications**: Some medications, such as topiramate (used for migraines and seizures), can also increase the risk of developing kidney stones.\n6. **Overactive Parathyroid Gland**: This condition can elevate blood calcium levels, contributing to stone formation.\n\n### Common Symptoms of Kidney Stones\nThe symptoms of kidney stones can vary depending on the size and location of the stone, but they often include:\n\n- **Severe Pain**: This is typically felt in the lower back, belly, or side and may radiate to the groin. The pain can be sharp and severe, often described as "colicky" because it can come in waves.\n- **Blood in Urine**: Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common symptom and may cause the urine to appear pink, red, or brown.\n- **Nausea and Vomiting**: These symptoms can occur due to the intense pain and discomfort.\n- **Frequent Urination**: An urgent need to urinate, often accompanied by pain during urination, can occur.\n- **Cloudy or Foul-Smelling Urine**: Changes in urine appearance and odor may indicate the presence of a kidney stone or infection.\n- **Fever and Chills**: These may occur if there is an associated infection.\n\nIn summary, kidney stones can arise from a combination of dietary, metabolic, and physiological factors, and they present with a range of symptoms primarily characterized by severe pain and changes in urinary characteristics. If you suspect you have kidney stones, it is important to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment.
