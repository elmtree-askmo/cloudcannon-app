    What are the specific bones included in the thorax?
answer: >-
    The thorax, also known as the chest, contains several specific bones that form the thoracic cage, which serves to protect vital organs such as the heart and lungs. The bones included in the thorax are:\n\n1. **Sternum**: This is a flat bone located at the center of the chest and is composed of three parts:\n   - **Manubrium**: The uppermost part of the sternum.\n   - **Body**: The central portion of the sternum.\n   - **Xiphoid Process**: The small, cartilaginous lower part of the sternum.\n\n2. **Ribs**: There are 12 pairs of ribs, which are curved, flat bones that form the lateral aspects of the thoracic cage. The ribs can be categorized as follows:\n   - **True Ribs**: The first seven pairs (ribs 1-7) that attach directly to the sternum via costal cartilage.\n   - **False Ribs**: The next three pairs (ribs 8-10) that do not attach directly to the sternum but connect to the sternum indirectly through the costal cartilage of the rib above.\n   - **Floating Ribs**: The last two pairs (ribs 11-12) that do not attach to the sternum at all and are only connected to the vertebrae.\n\n3. **Thoracic Vertebrae**: There are 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12) that form the posterior part of the thoracic cage. Each vertebra articulates with the ribs, providing structural support and protection for the spinal cord.\n\nIn summary, the specific bones included in the thorax are the sternum, 24 ribs (12 pairs), and 12 thoracic vertebrae, all of which work together to create a protective cage for the thoracic organs.
