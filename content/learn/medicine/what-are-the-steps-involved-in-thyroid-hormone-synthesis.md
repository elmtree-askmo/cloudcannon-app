    What are the steps involved in thyroid hormone synthesis?
answer: >-
    Thyroid hormone synthesis is a complex process that occurs primarily within the thyroid follicles, which serve as both the factory and storage site for these hormones. The synthesis of thyroid hormones, namely thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Iodide Uptake**: The process begins with the active transport of iodide from the bloodstream into the thyroid follicular cells. This is facilitated by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), which concentrates iodide within the cells.\n\n2. **Thyroglobulin (TG) Synthesis**: Within the follicular cells, thyroglobulin, a large glycoprotein rich in tyrosine residues, is synthesized. This protein is crucial as it serves as a precursor for the thyroid hormones.\n\n3. **Organification of Iodide**: Once iodide is inside the follicular cells, it is oxidized to active iodine by hydrogen peroxide, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The active iodine is then attached to the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, forming iodinated tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)).\n\n4. **Coupling Reactions**: The iodinated tyrosines undergo coupling reactions, where MIT and DIT combine to form T3 and T4. Specifically, one MIT and one DIT combine to produce T3, while two DIT molecules combine to form T4.\n\n5. **Storage and Release**: The iodinated thyroglobulin is stored in the colloid of the follicle. When the body requires thyroid hormones, thyroglobulin is endocytosed back into the follicular cells, where it is degraded by lysosomal enzymes, releasing T3 and T4 into the bloodstream.\n\n6. **Deiodination and Recycling**: Any excess iodinated tyrosines that are not used for hormone synthesis can be deiodinated, allowing the iodide to be recycled and reused in the synthesis process.\n\nThis intricate process is regulated by various factors, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, which controls the overall production and release of thyroid hormones based on the body's metabolic needs.
