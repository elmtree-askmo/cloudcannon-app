    What are the different types of thyroid cancer?
answer: >-
    Thyroid cancer is primarily classified into four main types based on the characteristics of the cancer cells and their behavior. These types are:\n\n1. **Papillary Thyroid Cancer**: This is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. It typically grows slowly and often spreads to nearby lymph nodes but has a good prognosis, especially in younger patients.\n\n2. **Follicular Thyroid Cancer**: This type is less common than papillary cancer and tends to grow slowly as well. It is characterized by its ability to invade blood vessels and can spread to distant organs. The prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate treatment.\n\n3. **Medullary Thyroid Cancer**: This type arises from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, which produce calcitonin. Medullary thyroid cancer can be sporadic or hereditary (associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2). It may not respond as well to standard treatments compared to papillary and follicular types, and its prognosis can vary.\n\n4. **Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer**: This is a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer that typically occurs in older adults. It grows rapidly and is often resistant to treatment, leading to a poor prognosis.\n\nThese types of thyroid cancer are classified based on their cellular characteristics, growth patterns, and prognosis. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for determining the appropriate management and treatment strategies for patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer.
