    What are the sonographic features indicative of acute cholecystitis?
answer: >-
    The sonographic features indicative of acute cholecystitis include several key findings that are critical for diagnosis. These features are primarily assessed through ultrasound, which is the preferred initial imaging modality for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. The following sonographic findings are commonly associated with acute cholecystitis:\n\n1. **Gallbladder Wall Thickening**: A thickened gallbladder wall, typically greater than 3 mm (and often cited as ≥4 mm), is a significant indicator of inflammation.\n\n2. **Positive Murphy's Sign**: This is a clinical sign that can be observed sonographically. It is characterized by pain elicited when the ultrasound probe is pressed over the gallbladder area, and it is present in approximately 96% of patients with acute cholecystitis.\n\n3. **Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)**: The presence of gallstones is a common finding, with sensitivity reported at around 95%. The identification of gallstones in conjunction with other findings strengthens the diagnosis.\n\n4. **Pericholecystic Fluid**: The presence of fluid surrounding the gallbladder is highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis, especially when combined with gallbladder wall thickening and a positive Murphy's sign.\n\n5. **Intraluminal Sludge**: The presence of sludge within the gallbladder can also be indicative of acute cholecystitis, particularly in the context of right upper quadrant pain.\n\n6. **Gallbladder Distension**: An enlarged gallbladder, with a long axis measurement of ≥8 cm and a short axis of ≥4 cm, can be observed in cases of acute cholecystitis.\n\n7. **Increased Vascularity**: Power Doppler sonography may reveal increased blood flow to the gallbladder wall, indicating inflammation.\n\nThese sonographic features, when correlated with clinical history and physical examination, can help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis effectively.
