    What blood tests are typically conducted to investigate thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    To investigate thyroid nodules, several blood tests are typically conducted to assess thyroid function and identify any underlying conditions. The primary tests include:\n\n1. **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)**: This test measures the level of TSH in the blood, which is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates thyroid hormone production. Abnormal TSH levels can indicate either hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).\n\n2. **Thyroxine (T4)**: This test measures the level of thyroxine, one of the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. It helps to evaluate the overall function of the thyroid.\n\n3. **Triiodothyronine (T3)**: Similar to T4, this test measures the level of triiodothyronine, another hormone produced by the thyroid. It is often assessed when TSH levels are abnormal.\n\n4. **Thyroid Antibodies**: Tests for antibodies such as thyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid peroxidase antibodies can help identify autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease.\n\n5. **Thyroglobulin**: This protein is produced by the thyroid gland, and measuring its levels can be useful, especially in patients with a history of thyroid cancer.\n\nIn cases where TSH levels are normal, further laboratory investigation may not be necessary unless autoimmune disease is suspected. However, if TSH is low-normal or high-normal, measuring T4 and T3 levels becomes essential to evaluate the thyroid function more comprehensively.\n\nThese blood tests are often complemented by imaging studies, such as ultrasound, to provide a complete assessment of thyroid nodules.
