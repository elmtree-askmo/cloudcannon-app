    What is the recommended timing for endoscopy in GI bleeding cases?
answer: >-
    The recommended timing for endoscopy in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is generally within 24 hours of presentation. This timeframe is supported by multiple studies and clinical guidelines, which suggest that early endoscopic intervention can improve patient outcomes. Specifically, it is advised that patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo endoscopy within 24 hours after gastroenterologic consultation.\n\nIn cases where variceal bleeding is suspected, urgent endoscopy within 12 hours is recommended due to the higher risk associated with this type of bleeding. However, the optimal timing for endoscopy in non-variceal bleeding remains somewhat controversial, with some studies indicating that very early endoscopy (within 12 hours) may not necessarily lead to better outcomes compared to the standard 24-hour window.\n\nOverall, while the consensus supports endoscopy within 24 hours for most cases of UGIB, clinical judgment and individual patient circumstances may influence the timing of the procedure.
