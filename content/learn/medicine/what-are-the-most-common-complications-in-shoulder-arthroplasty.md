    What are the most common complications in shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    The most common complications associated with shoulder arthroplasty can vary depending on the type of procedure performed (anatomical vs. reverse shoulder arthroplasty) and whether it is a primary or revision surgery. Here are the key complications:\n\n1. **Instability**: This is particularly common in reverse shoulder arthroplasty, where the joint may not remain stable post-surgery.\n\n2. **Infection**: Surgical site infections are a significant concern, especially in revision shoulder arthroplasty, where they occur in approximately 10.9% of cases. Infections can lead to serious complications and may require further surgical intervention.\n\n3. **Periprosthetic Fracture**: Fractures around the implant can occur, particularly in patients with weakened bone structures.\n\n4. **Component Loosening**: Aseptic loosening of the prosthetic components is a frequent issue, especially related to glenoid positioning and wear over time.\n\n5. **Neural Injury**: Nerve damage can occur during surgery, leading to complications such as weakness or loss of function in the shoulder.\n\n6. **Hematoma**: The accumulation of blood in the surgical area can lead to swelling and pain.\n\n7. **Rotator Cuff Tear**: This is a potential complication, particularly in anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty, where the integrity of the rotator cuff is crucial for shoulder function.\n\n8. **Scapular Notching**: This is specific to reverse shoulder arthroplasty and can lead to pain and reduced shoulder functionality.\n\n9. **Acromial and/or Scapular Spine Fracture**: These fractures can occur as a result of the surgical procedure or due to the stress placed on the shoulder postoperatively.\n\n10. **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**: Although the risk is relatively low (approximately 0.5% to 1%), blood clots can form after surgery, leading to serious complications.\n\nOverall, while the complication rates are generally low, they can significantly impact patient outcomes and recovery. Proper preoperative planning, surgical technique, and postoperative care are essential to minimize these risks.
