answer: >-
    Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation, leading to recurrent bleeding. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, affecting both men and women. The clinical features of HHT primarily include:\n\n1. **Telangiectasias**: These are small, dilated blood vessels that appear as red or purple spots on the skin and mucous membranes. They are commonly found on the lips, tongue, face, and inside the nose. These lesions can bleed easily, leading to recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis).\n\n2. **Recurrent Bleeding**: Patients often experience recurrent episodes of bleeding, which can occur from various sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and other organs. Gastrointestinal bleeding may manifest as melena (black, tarry stools) or hematochezia (bright red blood in stools).\n\n3. **Anemia**: Chronic blood loss from telangiectasias can lead to iron deficiency anemia, which may present with fatigue, pallor, and weakness.\n\n4. **Pulmonary Complications**: HHT can lead to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the lungs, which can cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and may lead to significant respiratory complications.\n\n5. **Cerebral AVMs**: Patients may also develop AVMs in the brain, which can result in neurological symptoms or hemorrhagic strokes.\n\n6. **Other Associated Conditions**: HHT is associated with several conditions, including:\n   - **Gastrointestinal Malformations**: Such as angiodysplasia, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.\n   - **Aortic Aneurysms**: Increased risk of aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n   - **Hereditary Conditions**: Patients may have a family history of similar symptoms, as HHT is hereditary.\n\n7. **Skin Changes**: Chronic exposure to sunlight can lead to photoaging of the skin, which may exacerbate the appearance of telangiectasias.\n\nManagement of HHT focuses on monitoring and treating bleeding episodes, which may require endoscopic or surgical interventions. Regular follow-up and screening for associated complications, such as pulmonary and cerebral AVMs, are also essential for effective management.\n\nIn summary, the clinical features of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia include telangiectasias, recurrent bleeding, anemia, and potential complications involving the lungs and brain, along with a family history of the disorder.
