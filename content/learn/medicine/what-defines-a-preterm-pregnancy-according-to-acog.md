    What defines a preterm pregnancy according to ACOG?
answer: >-
    According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), preterm birth is defined as delivery occurring between 20 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. Preterm labor is characterized by regular uterine contractions that lead to cervical changes before 37 weeks of gestation. This can include changes in cervical dilation, effacement, or both. \n\nPreterm births can be classified as spontaneous or due to maternal or fetal complications. Early preterm birth refers to deliveries that occur up to 34 weeks of gestation. It is important to note that preterm birth is a significant concern in obstetrics, as it is associated with increased risks of neonatal mortality and long-term health issues for the infant. \n\nIn summary, ACOG defines preterm pregnancy as any birth that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation, with specific criteria for diagnosing preterm labor based on clinical observations of uterine contractions and cervical changes.
