    What is the definition of a late term pregnancy according to ACOG?
answer: >-
    According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a late-term pregnancy is defined as one that has reached between 41 weeks 0 days (41 0/7 weeks) and 41 weeks 6 days (41 6/7 weeks) of gestation. This classification is part of ACOG's efforts to provide more specific gestational age designations, which also include early term, full term, and post-term pregnancies. Post-term pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that has reached or extended beyond 42 weeks (42 0/7 weeks) of gestation. \n\nThese definitions are outlined in ACOG's Practice Bulletin on the Management of Late-Term and Postterm Pregnancies, which emphasizes the importance of accurate gestational age determination for appropriate management and monitoring of pregnancies during this period.
