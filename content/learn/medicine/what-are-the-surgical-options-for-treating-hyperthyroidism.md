    What are the surgical options for treating hyperthyroidism?
answer: >-
    Surgical options for treating hyperthyroidism primarily involve a procedure known as thyroidectomy, which is the surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. This approach is typically considered when other treatments, such as antithyroid medications or radioactive iodine therapy, are not effective or suitable for the patient. \n\nThere are several indications for considering surgery in the management of hyperthyroidism:\n\n1. **Large Goiter**: If the thyroid gland is significantly enlarged and causing compressive symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, surgery may be necessary.\n2. **Suspicious Nodules**: If there are nodules within the thyroid that raise concerns for cancer, surgical intervention may be warranted.\n3. **Graves' Orbitopathy**: Patients with Graves' disease who experience eye complications may also be candidates for surgery.\n4. **Patient Preference**: Some patients may prefer surgical options over long-term medication or radioactive iodine therapy.\n\nThere are different types of thyroidectomy procedures:\n\n- **Total Thyroidectomy**: This involves the complete removal of the thyroid gland and is often recommended for conditions like Graves' disease, multinodular goiter, or suspected thyroid cancer.\n- **Partial Thyroidectomy**: In some cases, only a portion of the thyroid gland may be removed, particularly if there are toxic nodules present.\n\nSurgery is generally considered safe, with serious complications occurring in less than 2% of cases. However, as with any surgical procedure, there are inherent risks involved. Postoperative care typically includes monitoring hormone levels through routine blood tests to ensure that thyroid hormone levels are restored to normal.\n\nIn summary, while surgery is not the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism, it remains an important option in specific clinical scenarios where other treatments are inadequate or inappropriate.
