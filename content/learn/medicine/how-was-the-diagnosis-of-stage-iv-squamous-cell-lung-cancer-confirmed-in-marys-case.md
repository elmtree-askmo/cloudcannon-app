answer: >-
    The diagnosis of Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer in Mary's case would typically be confirmed through a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and histopathological analysis. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the process:\n\n1. **Clinical Evaluation**: Patients often present with symptoms that prompt further investigation. Common symptoms of advanced lung cancer include a persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and weight loss. In Mary's case, the severity of her symptoms likely led to a lung cancer screening.\n\n2. **Imaging Studies**: Initial imaging, such as a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan, is crucial for identifying lung nodules or masses. These imaging studies help determine the size of the tumor and whether it has spread to other parts of the body, which is essential for staging the cancer.\n\n3. **Biopsy**: A definitive diagnosis of squamous cell lung carcinoma is made through a biopsy, where a sample of the tumor tissue is removed and examined microscopically. This histopathological analysis confirms the presence of cancerous cells and helps differentiate squamous cell carcinoma from other types of lung cancer.\n\n4. **Staging**: Once the diagnosis is confirmed, staging is performed to assess the extent of the disease. Stage IV indicates that the cancer has metastasized beyond the lungs to other organs or distant sites in the body. This staging is critical for determining the appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn summary, the confirmation of Mary's diagnosis as Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer would involve a thorough clinical assessment, imaging studies to visualize the extent of the disease, and a biopsy to confirm the histological type of cancer.
