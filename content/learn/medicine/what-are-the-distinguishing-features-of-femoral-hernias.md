    What are the distinguishing features of femoral hernias?
answer: >-
    Femoral hernias are a specific type of groin hernia that have several distinguishing features compared to inguinal hernias. Here are the key characteristics that differentiate femoral hernias:\n\n1. **Location**: Femoral hernias occur in the femoral canal, which is located just below the inguinal ligament and lateral to the pubic tubercle. In contrast, inguinal hernias are situated above and medial to the pubic tubercle. This anatomical distinction is crucial for diagnosis.\n\n2. **Clinical Presentation**: Femoral hernias typically present as a small, rounded bulge in the upper thigh or groin area. They may be less prominent than inguinal hernias and can often be mistaken for other conditions. The bulge is usually located below the inguinal ligament.\n\n3. **Neck Characteristics**: The neck of a femoral hernia is often described as funnel-shaped and can be seen on imaging studies, such as CT scans, as a narrow protrusion through the femoral ring, just medial to the common femoral vein. This is in contrast to inguinal hernias, which do not have this specific neck shape.\n\n4. **Symptoms**: While both types of hernias can present with a bulge, femoral hernias may also cause discomfort or pain, especially during movement. They are more likely to be asymptomatic initially, but complications such as strangulation can lead to severe symptoms, including nausea and abdominal pain.\n\n5. **Risk Factors**: Femoral hernias are more common in females, particularly in multiparous women, and are associated with factors such as increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., heavy lifting, chronic constipation) and advancing age.\n\n6. **Complications**: Femoral hernias have a higher risk of complications, such as strangulation, due to the tight confines of the femoral canal. This can lead to significant mass effects and requires prompt surgical intervention.\n\nUnderstanding these distinguishing features is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of femoral hernias.
