    What is the medical definition of dysphagia?
answer: >-
    Dysphagia is defined as the medical term for difficulty swallowing. It encompasses a range of swallowing difficulties that can manifest as discomfort, pain (known as odynophagia), or an inability to swallow solids, liquids, or even saliva safely. The condition can arise from various issues affecting the muscles and nerves involved in the swallowing process, which are responsible for moving food or drink from the mouth to the stomach. \n\nClinically, dysphagia is characterized by an abnormal delay in the transit of a liquid or solid bolus from the oral cavity to the stomach. It can be acute or chronic, intermittent or persistent, and may be accompanied by a sensation of food sticking in the throat or chest. Dysphagia is often associated with a variety of medical conditions, particularly in older adults, and can significantly impact quality of life if not properly diagnosed and treated.
