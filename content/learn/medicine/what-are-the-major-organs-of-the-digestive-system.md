    What are the major organs of the digestive system?
answer: >-
    The major organs of the digestive system include:\n\n1. **Mouth**: The entry point for food, where mechanical digestion begins through chewing, and chemical digestion starts with saliva.\n\n2. **Pharynx**: The throat area that connects the mouth to the esophagus, playing a role in swallowing.\n\n3. **Esophagus**: A muscular tube that transports food from the pharynx to the stomach through peristaltic movements.\n\n4. **Stomach**: A hollow organ that holds food while it is mixed with stomach enzymes and acids, further breaking down food into a semi-liquid form called chyme.\n\n5. **Small Intestine**: Comprising three segments—the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum—this long muscular tube (approximately 22 feet) is where most digestion and nutrient absorption occurs. Enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver aid in this process.\n\n6. **Large Intestine (Colon)**: This includes several parts:\n   - **Cecum**: The uppermost section that connects to the ileum.\n   - **Ascending Colon**: The right side of the colon that moves waste upward.\n   - **Transverse Colon**: The section that runs across the abdomen.\n   - **Descending Colon**: The left side of the colon that moves waste downward.\n   - **Sigmoid Colon**: The S-shaped section that connects to the rectum.\n\n7. **Rectum**: The final section of the large intestine that stores waste until it is excreted.\n\n8. **Accessory Organs**:\n   - **Liver**: Processes nutrients absorbed from the small intestine and produces bile, which helps digest fats.\n   - **Gallbladder**: Stores and concentrates bile, releasing it into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion.\n   - **Pancreas**: Produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate, which are released into the small intestine to assist in digestion.\n\nThese organs work together to break down food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste, playing a crucial role in maintaining overall health and homeostasis in the body.
