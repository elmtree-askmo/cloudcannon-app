    How is a small bowel follow-through conducted and what does it diagnose?
answer: >-
    A small bowel follow-through (SBFT) is a fluoroscopic imaging procedure used to evaluate the small intestine, also known as the small bowel. The procedure involves the patient ingesting a barium sulfate contrast material, which coats the lining of the small intestine and enhances the visibility of the gastrointestinal tract during X-ray imaging.\n\n### Procedure Overview\n1. **Preparation**: Before the procedure, patients are typically required to fast for several hours and may be asked to take a laxative to clear the bowel.\n2. **Ingestion of Contrast**: The patient drinks a liquid suspension of barium sulfate, which helps outline the anatomy of the small bowel.\n3. **Imaging Process**: The procedure usually takes between 2 to 4 hours. As the barium moves through the small intestine, the radiologist captures real-time images using fluoroscopy. The patient may be repositioned (turned side to side) to obtain the best views of the small bowel.\n4. **Examination of the Terminal Ileum**: The radiologist pays particular attention to the terminal ileum, the last part of the small intestine, often using a compression device to better visualize this area.\n\n### Diagnostic Uses\nThe small bowel follow-through is primarily used to diagnose various conditions affecting the small intestine, including:\n- **Tumors**: Identification of neoplasms within the small bowel.\n- **Obstructions**: Detection of blockages, which may be due to adhesions (scar tissue) or cancer.\n- **Inflammatory Diseases**: Evaluation of conditions such as Crohn's disease, which can cause inflammation and other changes in the bowel.\n\nOverall, the small bowel follow-through is a valuable diagnostic tool in gastrointestinal radiology, providing critical information about the structure and function of the small intestine.
