    How should rescue breaths be given to infants during CPR?
answer: >-
    To give rescue breaths to infants during CPR, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Positioning**: Ensure the infant is lying on their back on a firm surface. Tilt the infant's head back very slightly to open the airway, using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique. Be careful not to apply pressure on the neck or the soft tissue under the chin.\n\n2. **Seal the Mouth and Nose**: Cover the infant's mouth and nose with your mouth to create a complete seal.\n\n3. **Delivering the Breaths**: Take a breath and blow gently into the infant's mouth and nose for about 1 second. It is crucial to ensure that each breath makes the infant's chest rise visibly. \n\n4. **Breath Rate**: The ventilation rate for infants during CPR is approximately 1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds, which translates to about 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\n5. **Rescue Breaths After Compressions**: After performing 30 chest compressions, pause to give 2 rescue breaths. Repeat this cycle of 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive or the infant shows signs of life.\n\n6. **Initial Rescue Breaths**: If you are the first responder, start with 5 initial rescue breaths before beginning chest compressions, while also observing for any gag or cough response, which indicates a sign of life.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively provide rescue breaths to an infant in need of CPR, ensuring that oxygen is delivered to their lungs during a cardiac emergency.
