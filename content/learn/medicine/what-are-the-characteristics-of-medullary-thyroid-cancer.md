    What are the characteristics of medullary thyroid cancer?
answer: >-
    Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells, also known as C cells, of the thyroid gland. Here are some key characteristics of medullary thyroid cancer:\n\n1. **Origin and Pathophysiology**: MTC is derived from the parafollicular C cells, which are of neural crest origin. These cells produce calcitonin, a hormone involved in calcium homeostasis.\n\n2. **Calcitonin Production**: One of the hallmark features of MTC is the production of calcitonin. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood are often used as a diagnostic marker for this type of cancer.\n\n3. **Incidence**: MTC accounts for about 1% to 2% of all thyroid cancers, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States.\n\n4. **Symptoms**: The earliest sign of MTC is typically a painless lump in the neck. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include pain or discomfort in the neck, hoarseness, and potentially symptoms related to metastasis if the cancer spreads.\n\n5. **Genetic Factors**: MTC can occur sporadically or as part of hereditary syndromes, particularly multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Genetic testing for mutations in the RET proto-oncogene is recommended for patients with a family history of MTC or MEN2.\n\n6. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis often involves blood tests to measure calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, imaging studies (such as CT scans or ultrasounds), and a biopsy to confirm the presence of cancerous cells.\n\n7. **Treatment**: The primary treatment for MTC is total thyroidectomy, which involves the complete removal of the thyroid gland. Central neck dissection may also be performed to remove affected lymph nodes. Unlike other types of thyroid cancer, MTC does not respond to radioactive iodine therapy.\n\n8. **Prognosis and Follow-Up**: The prognosis for MTC can vary based on the stage at diagnosis and the presence of metastasis. Regular follow-up examinations are crucial, as MTC can recur many years after initial treatment.\n\n9. **Management of Advanced Disease**: For advanced or metastatic MTC, targeted therapies such as cabozantinib, pralsetinib, and selpercatinib have shown promising results in clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, medullary thyroid cancer is a unique and complex malignancy with specific characteristics related to its origin, diagnosis, and management. Understanding these features is essential for effective treatment and follow-up care.
