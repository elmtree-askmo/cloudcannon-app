    What is the difference between testicular torsion and a hydrocele?
answer: >-
    Testicular torsion and hydrocele are two distinct conditions affecting the scrotum, and they have different causes, symptoms, and implications.\n\n**Testicular Torsion**:\n- **Definition**: Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off the blood supply to the testicle. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent testicular loss.\n- **Symptoms**: The hallmark of testicular torsion is sudden, severe pain in one testicle, which may radiate to the abdomen. Other symptoms can include nausea and vomiting. The affected testicle may appear higher than normal in the scrotum.\n- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is typically made through a physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests such as a scrotal ultrasound to assess blood flow to the testicle.\n- **Treatment**: Surgical intervention is necessary to untwist the spermatic cord and restore blood flow. Prompt treatment is crucial, as testicular viability significantly decreases within six hours of symptom onset.\n\n**Hydrocele**:\n- **Definition**: A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac surrounding a testicle, leading to swelling in the scrotum. It is usually a benign condition and can occur in one or both testicles.\n- **Symptoms**: Hydroceles are often painless and may present as a swelling in the scrotum that feels heavy. The swelling can fluctuate in size but typically does not cause significant discomfort.\n- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is often made through a physical examination and may include transillumination, where a light is shone through the scrotum to confirm the presence of clear fluid. Ultrasound may also be used to rule out other conditions.\n- **Treatment**: Hydroceles may not require treatment unless they cause discomfort or are associated with other underlying issues. In such cases, surgical intervention may be considered.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in the urgency of treatment, the nature of the symptoms, and the underlying causes. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency requiring immediate attention, while a hydrocele is generally a non-emergency condition that may not need treatment unless symptomatic.
