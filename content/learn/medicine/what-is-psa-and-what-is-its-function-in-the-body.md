    What is PSA and what is its function in the body?
answer: >-
    Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced primarily by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland in men and the paraurethral glands in women. It is also known as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3). The primary function of PSA is to liquefy semen, which is essential for the mobility of sperm during ejaculation. \n\nIn the context of health, PSA is mostly found in semen, with small amounts circulating in the blood. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of PSA in the bloodstream. Elevated levels of PSA can indicate various conditions, including prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostatitis. However, interpreting PSA levels can be complex, as many factors can influence these levels, including age and other benign conditions.\n\nThe PSA test plays a significant role in the early detection and management of prostate health issues. While high PSA levels are often associated with prostate cancer, there is no definitive normal or abnormal PSA level, as it can vary from person to person. Generally, a PSA level above 4 ng/mL is considered elevated, but this threshold can differ based on individual risk factors and age.\n\nIn summary, PSA is a crucial biomarker in urology, particularly for screening and monitoring prostate health, but it is important to consider the broader clinical context when interpreting PSA test results.
