    How does a white blood cell count assist in diagnosing infections?
answer: >-
    A white blood cell (WBC) count is a crucial laboratory test used in diagnosing infections. The normal range for WBCs is typically between 5,000 to 10,000 cells per microliter of blood. An elevated WBC count, known as leukocytosis, often indicates the presence of an infection or inflammation in the body. For instance, if a patient's WBC count is reported at 15,500 cells per microliter, this would raise concern for an ongoing infection, as it exceeds the normal upper limit.\n\nConversely, a low WBC count, referred to as leukopenia, can suggest a compromised immune system, making the individual more susceptible to infections. For example, a WBC count of 3,500 cells per microliter would indicate a significant risk for infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nIn summary, the WBC count assists in diagnosing infections by providing a quantitative measure of the body's immune response. Elevated levels suggest an active infection that requires further investigation to identify the source, while low levels indicate a potential vulnerability to infections. This information is vital for clinicians in making informed decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies.
