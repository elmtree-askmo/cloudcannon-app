    What are the key surgical techniques used in anatomical shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    Anatomical shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) is a surgical procedure designed to replace the damaged components of the shoulder joint with artificial implants, aiming to restore function and alleviate pain. The key surgical techniques involved in aTSA include:\n\n1. **Preoperative Evaluation**: A thorough assessment of the patient's shoulder anatomy and pathology is essential. This includes imaging studies to evaluate the glenoid and humeral head, as well as assessing the range of motion and strength.\n\n2. **Glenoid Preparation**: The surgical technique typically involves asymmetric reaming of the glenoid to achieve less than 10° of retroversion and approximately 10° of inferior tilt. This preparation is crucial for proper alignment and stability of the glenoid component.\n\n3. **Baseplate Fixation**: After preparing the glenoid, the baseplate of the glenoid component is fixed using four or five screws, depending on the available bone stock. This fixation is vital to ensure the longevity and stability of the implant.\n\n4. **Humeral Component Placement**: The humeral head component is then implanted. This usually involves the use of a metal ball made from a special type of stainless steel, which is attached to a titanium stem that secures the ball to the humerus.\n\n5. **Stemless Options**: Recent advancements have introduced stemless anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty, which avoids the complications associated with traditional stemmed implants. This technique preserves more bone stock and can lead to improved radiographic outcomes and easier revision if necessary.\n\n6. **Postoperative Care**: Following the surgery, a structured rehabilitation protocol is initiated to restore range of motion and strength. This typically includes physical therapy and gradual progression of activities.\n\nThese techniques are designed to address various shoulder pathologies, including osteoarthritis and rotator cuff tears, and to improve the overall functional outcomes for patients undergoing shoulder replacement surgery.
