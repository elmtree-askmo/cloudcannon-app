    How is gestational diabetes screened and diagnosed?
answer: >-
    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is typically screened and diagnosed through a combination of blood tests that assess how well the body processes glucose. The screening process generally follows one of two approaches: a 1-step or a 2-step method.\n\n1. **1-Step Approach**: This method involves administering a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after obtaining a fasting glucose level. Plasma glucose levels are then measured at 1 hour and 2 hours post-glucose load. A diagnosis of GDM is made if two or more glucose values meet or exceed the following thresholds:\n   - Fasting: ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (≥ 92 mg/dL)\n   - 1 hour: ≥ 10.0 mmol/L (≥ 180 mg/dL)\n   - 2 hours: ≥ 8.5 mmol/L (≥ 153 mg/dL)\n\n2. **2-Step Approach**: This method begins with a glucose challenge test (GCT), where a non-fasting blood sample is taken after the patient consumes a glucose solution. If the GCT result is abnormal (typically a blood glucose level ≥ 130 mg/dL or ≥ 140 mg/dL), a follow-up 100-gram, 3-hour OGTT is performed. The diagnosis of GDM is confirmed if two or more of the following values are abnormal:\n   - 1 hour: > 180 mg/dL\n   - 2 hours: > 155 mg/dL\n   - 3 hours: > 140 mg/dL\n\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that all pregnant women be screened for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, although those at higher risk may be tested earlier. Additionally, it is advised that women who have had GDM undergo a follow-up OGTT 4 to 12 weeks postpartum to check for the development of type 2 diabetes or other glucose metabolism issues.\n\nIn summary, the screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes involve systematic blood glucose testing, with specific thresholds that guide the diagnosis, ensuring that both maternal and fetal health are monitored effectively.
