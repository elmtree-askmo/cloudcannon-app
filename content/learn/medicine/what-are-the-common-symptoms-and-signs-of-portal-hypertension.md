    What are the common symptoms and signs of portal hypertension?
answer: >-
    Portal hypertension is characterized by increased blood pressure in the portal venous system, which drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and spleen into the liver. The most common cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis, which leads to scarring of the liver and subsequent complications.\n\nCommon symptoms and signs of portal hypertension include:\n\n1. **Varices**: Enlarged veins, particularly in the esophagus and stomach, which can rupture and cause significant bleeding.\n2. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding**: This may manifest as blood in vomit (hematemesis) or black, tarry stools (melena).\n3. **Ascites**: Accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, leading to a swollen abdomen and discomfort.\n4. **Splenomegaly**: Enlargement of the spleen, which can be detected during a physical examination.\n5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: Cognitive impairment that can range from mild confusion to severe disorientation, often due to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.\n6. **Swelling in the Legs and Feet**: Due to fluid retention associated with portal hypertension.\n7. **Abdominal Discomfort**: General discomfort or pain in the abdomen, often related to ascites or splenomegaly.\n\nIt is important to note that many individuals with portal hypertension may not exhibit symptoms until complications arise. Up to 90% of people with cirrhosis may have portal hypertension without noticeable symptoms, and up to 40% may already have large varices. Diagnosis is typically based on a combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination, and imaging studies such as Doppler ultrasonography, CT scans, or MRI.\n\nIn summary, while portal hypertension can be asymptomatic in its early stages, it can lead to serious complications that require prompt medical attention.
