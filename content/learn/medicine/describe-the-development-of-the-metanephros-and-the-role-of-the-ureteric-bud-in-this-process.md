answer: >-
    The development of the metanephros, which is the final and permanent stage of kidney development, begins around the fifth week of gestation. This process is crucial for forming the functional kidneys, which are responsible for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body.\n\n### Key Structures Involved in Metanephros Development\n\n1. **Ureteric Bud**: This structure is an outgrowth from the mesonephric duct. It plays a pivotal role in the development of the metanephros by interacting with the metanephric mesenchyme. The ureteric bud gives rise to several important components of the urinary system, including the ureter, renal pelvis, major and minor calices, and the collecting ducts.\n\n2. **Metanephric Mesenchyme (Metanephric Blastema)**: This tissue differentiates from the intermediate mesoderm and is essential for the formation of nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. The metanephric mesenchyme produces growth factors that stimulate the growth of the ureteric bud.\n\n### Development Process\n\nThe development of the metanephros involves a process known as **reciprocal induction**. This is a dynamic interaction between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme:\n\n- **Initial Interaction**: The metanephric mesenchyme produces growth factors that induce the ureteric bud to sprout from the mesonephric duct. In response, the ureteric bud secretes growth factors that promote the proliferation and differentiation of the metanephric mesenchyme.\n\n- **Formation of Nephrons**: As the ureteric bud elongates and branches, it penetrates the metanephric mesenchyme. This interaction leads to the formation of nephrons, which include structures such as the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubule. The metanephric mesenchyme surrounds the ureteric bud, facilitating the development of the kidney's functional architecture.\n\n- **Ureter Formation**: The ureteric bud eventually elongates to form the ureter, which connects the kidney to the bladder. This process typically occurs around the sixth week of gestation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the metanephros develops through the intricate interplay between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme, characterized by reciprocal induction. This process is essential for the formation of the functional kidneys, which will continue to mature until approximately 36 weeks of gestation. The successful development of the metanephros is critical for establishing a functional urinary system in the embryo.
