    What role does lithium play as a mood stabilizer and what are its side effects?
answer: >-
    Lithium is a well-established mood stabilizer primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly for managing manic episodes. It has been recognized as the gold standard among mood stabilizers for over half a century, with substantial empirical evidence supporting its efficacy. Despite its long history of use, the precise mechanisms by which lithium exerts its mood-stabilizing effects remain not fully understood. However, it is believed to influence neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly catecholamines and serotonin, and to alter intracellular signaling pathways, which may enhance cell survival and neuroprotection.\n\nLithium's therapeutic range is typically between 0.6â€“1.2 mEq/L, and maintaining this level is crucial for its effectiveness. Regular monitoring of lithium levels, as well as kidney and thyroid function, is essential due to the potential for side effects and lithium toxicity.\n\nCommon side effects of lithium include:\n\n- Tremors\n- Frequent urination\n- Nausea\n- Cognitive dulling, which may manifest as a feeling of being "numb" or less sharp\n- Potential thyroid problems\n- Risks of lithium toxicity, which can be serious and even fatal if levels exceed 2.0 mEq/L\n\nSymptoms of lithium toxicity can include severe gastrointestinal distress, tremors, confusion, and in extreme cases, seizures or coma. It is crucial for individuals taking lithium to adhere to prescribed dosages and to have regular follow-ups with their healthcare provider to monitor for these side effects and ensure safe use of the medication.
