    What are the main classes of medications used to treat overactive bladder?
answer: >-
    The main classes of medications used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) include:\n\n1. **Anticholinergics (Antimuscarinics)**: \n   - These medications are the cornerstone of pharmacological management for OAB. They work by blocking muscarinic receptors, particularly the M3 subtype, which are crucial for the contraction of the detrusor muscle during bladder filling and voiding. By inhibiting the action of acetylcholine (ACh) on these receptors, anticholinergics reduce involuntary bladder contractions and improve bladder storage capacity. Common examples include:\n     - Oxybutynin\n     - Tolterodine\n     - Solifenacin\n     - Darifenacin\n     - Fesoterodine\n   - Side effects may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and cognitive impairment, particularly in older adults.\n\n2. **Beta-3 Agonists**: \n   - This class of medications works by stimulating beta-3 adrenergic receptors in the bladder, leading to relaxation of the detrusor muscle and increased bladder capacity. This mechanism helps to reduce symptoms of urgency and frequency. The primary medication in this category is:\n     - Mirabegron\n   - Beta-3 agonists may have a different side effect profile compared to anticholinergics, with potential side effects including increased blood pressure and urinary tract infections.\n\nThese medications can be used alone or in combination, depending on the severity of symptoms and the patient's response to treatment. It's important for patients to discuss potential side effects and treatment options with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate management strategy for their condition.
