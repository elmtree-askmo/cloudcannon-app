    Thyroid nodules are commonly found incidentally during imaging studies, with prevalence rates varying by technique. This article discusses the frequency of incidental thyroid nodules, their detection rates in different imaging modalities, and the implications for patient evaluation and management.

    How often are thyroid nodules found incidentally?
answer: >-
    Thyroid nodules are frequently found incidentally during imaging studies conducted for reasons unrelated to thyroid disease. The prevalence of incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs) varies significantly based on the imaging technique used. Studies indicate that ITNs can be detected in:\n\n- 20% to 67% of ultrasound studies,\n- Up to 25% of contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) scans,\n- 16% to 18% of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the neck.\n\nOverall, the prevalence of ITNs ranges from 1% to 67%, depending on the specific radiological method employed. For instance, a study involving 755 subjects found an ITN prevalence of 18% among those with nodules measuring 5 mm or larger. \n\nIn summary, incidental thyroid nodules are quite common, with a significant proportion of the population likely having at least one nodule by the time they reach 60 years of age. This underscores the importance of careful evaluation of these findings, particularly in light of individual risk factors for malignancy.
