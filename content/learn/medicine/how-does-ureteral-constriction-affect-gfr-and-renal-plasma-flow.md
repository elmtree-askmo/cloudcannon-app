    How does ureteral constriction affect GFR and renal plasma flow?
answer: >-
    Ureteral constriction significantly impacts glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). When the ureter is constricted, it leads to a narrowing that impedes the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder. This obstruction results in increased pressure within the renal pelvis, which creates back pressure on the nephron.\n\n### Effects on GFR and RPF:\n\n1. **Decreased GFR**: The back pressure caused by ureteral constriction reduces the hydrostatic pressure gradient necessary for filtration in the glomeruli. As a result, GFR decreases because the pressure that drives filtration is compromised.\n\n2. **Decreased RPF**: The constriction also affects renal blood flow. As the outflow of urine is obstructed, the increased pressure within the kidney can lead to a decrease in renal blood flow. This is because the kidneys may respond to the increased pressure by constricting the afferent arterioles, which further reduces blood flow into the glomeruli.\n\n3. **Decreased Filtration Fraction**: The filtration fraction, which is the ratio of GFR to RPF, also decreases due to the combined effects of reduced GFR and RPF. Since both parameters are lowered, the filtration fraction reflects this decrease.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, ureteral constriction leads to:\n- A decrease in GFR due to back pressure on the nephron.\n- A decrease in RPF as the kidney responds to increased pressure.\n- A decrease in filtration fraction as both GFR and RPF are reduced.\n\nUnderstanding these physiological responses is crucial for comprehending renal function and the implications of urinary obstruction in clinical settings.
