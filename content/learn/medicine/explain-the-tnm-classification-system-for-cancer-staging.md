    Explain the TNM classification system for cancer staging.
answer: >-
    The TNM classification system is a widely used method for staging cancer, which helps in determining the extent of the disease and guiding treatment decisions. The system evaluates three primary components:\n\n1. **T (Tumor Size and Extent)**: This component assesses the size of the primary tumor and its local extent. It is usually classified as:\n   - T0: No evidence of primary tumor.\n   - T1, T2, T3, T4: Increasing size or local extent of the tumor, with higher numbers indicating larger tumors or more extensive local invasion.\n\n2. **N (Lymph Node Involvement)**: This component evaluates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. The classification is as follows:\n   - N0: No regional lymph node involvement.\n   - N1, N2, N3: Increasing involvement of regional lymph nodes, with higher numbers indicating more nodes affected or more extensive spread.\n\n3. **M (Metastasis)**: This component indicates whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. It is classified as:\n   - M0: No distant metastasis.\n   - M1: Distant metastasis is present.\n\nFor example, a tumor classified as T2 N1 M0 indicates a tumor of moderate size (T2), involvement of nearby lymph nodes (N1), and no distant metastasis (M0). \n\nThe TNM classification is crucial for determining the stage of cancer, which typically ranges from Stage I (localized) to Stage IV (advanced with metastasis). Understanding the stage of cancer is essential for planning treatment strategies, predicting outcomes, and facilitating communication among healthcare providers.
