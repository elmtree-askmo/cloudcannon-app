answer: >-
    The EndoFLIP (Functional Luminal Imaging Probe) is a minimally invasive diagnostic tool that plays a significant role in the assessment and management of dysphagia, particularly in evaluating esophageal function. It utilizes high-resolution planimetry to create a three-dimensional image of the esophageal lumen, measuring parameters such as diameter, volume, and pressure changes. This technology enhances traditional endoscopic procedures by providing detailed insights into the esophagus's structural and functional characteristics.\n\nEndoFLIP is particularly relevant for patients with undifferentiated dysphagia, as it can assess sphincter function, wall stiffness, and motility. It has been suggested that EndoFLIP may become the initial diagnostic test for these patients during their index endoscopy. The system is valuable in identifying non-obstructive dysphagia and can guide therapeutic interventions, such as botulinum injections, pneumatic dilation, or myotomy, based on the findings.\n\nClinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of EndoFLIP in various scenarios. For instance, it has been shown to be abnormal in all patients with achalasia, making it a reliable screening tool. Additionally, when used as the first diagnostic study, it has resulted in fewer additional tests for patients, indicating its efficiency in the diagnostic process.\n\nOverall, the EndoFLIP system represents a significant advancement in the understanding and assessment of esophageal motility disorders, providing clinicians with critical information to guide treatment decisions for patients experiencing dysphagia.
