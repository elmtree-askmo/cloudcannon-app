    What are the potential complications of untreated liver cancer?
answer: >-
    Untreated liver cancer can lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications due to the liver's critical role in metabolism, enzyme activation, and the storage of essential nutrients. Here are some of the key complications associated with untreated liver cancer:\n\n1. **Increased Tumor Growth**: Without treatment, liver cancer tumors can grow at a faster rate, leading to larger masses within the liver. This can result in more severe symptoms and complications as the tumor expands.\n\n2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: This condition can arise due to the liver's inability to filter toxins from the blood, leading to a buildup of harmful substances. Symptoms may include memory loss, disorientation, personality changes, and severe confusion, which can mimic Alzheimer's disease. Hepatic encephalopathy is often reversible if the underlying cause is addressed.\n\n3. **Hypoglycemia**: Liver cancer can disrupt the liver's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, potentially leading to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include dizziness, confusion, and fainting.\n\n4. **Jaundice**: As the cancer progresses, it may obstruct bile ducts, leading to jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to the accumulation of bilirubin.\n\n5. **Cirrhosis**: Untreated liver cancer can exacerbate or lead to cirrhosis, a condition where the liver becomes severely scarred and loses its function. This can further complicate treatment options and worsen the patient's overall health.\n\n6. **Metastasis**: Liver cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and distant organs, significantly complicating treatment and reducing survival rates. The relative 5-year survival rate for liver cancer that has metastasized is only about 11%.\n\n7. **Poor Prognosis**: The median life expectancy for individuals with stage 4 liver cancer who do not receive treatment is less than four months. The overall survival rate for liver cancer patients is low, with a five-year survival rate of only about 15% across all stages.\n\nIn summary, untreated liver cancer can lead to a cascade of complications that severely impact the patient's quality of life and overall prognosis. It is crucial for individuals diagnosed with liver cancer to consult healthcare providers to discuss potential treatment options and manage the disease effectively.
