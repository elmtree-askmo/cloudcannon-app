    What are the typical endoscopic findings in upper GI bleeding?
answer: >-
    The typical endoscopic findings in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) can vary based on the underlying cause of the bleeding. Here are some common findings:\n\n1. **Peptic Ulcers**: These are one of the most frequent causes of UGIB. Endoscopically, they may present as blood oozing from a peptic ulcer located in the duodenal bulb, often covered with an adherent clot.\n\n2. **Dieulafoy Lesion**: This is a rare but significant cause of UGIB, characterized by a large, tortuous artery that can bleed profusely. Endoscopic findings may show a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion on the greater curvature of the gastric body.\n\n3. **Mallory-Weiss Tear**: This condition results from a tear in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction, typically at the Z-line. Endoscopy may reveal a tear with associated bleeding.\n\n4. **Variceal Bleeding**: In patients with portal hypertension, esophageal varices can rupture, leading to significant bleeding. Endoscopic findings often include distended veins in the esophagus, which may be actively bleeding or have stigmata of recent hemorrhage.\n\n5. **Erosive Gastritis and Esophagitis**: These conditions can lead to superficial mucosal damage and bleeding. Endoscopic findings may show erosive lesions in the gastric or esophageal mucosa.\n\n6. **Malignancies**: Upper GI malignancies can also present with bleeding. Endoscopic examination may reveal tumors or ulcerated lesions in the stomach or esophagus.\n\n7. **Stigmata of Recent Hemorrhage**: These are specific findings that indicate recent bleeding, such as visible vessels, adherent clots, or active bleeding, which are critical for determining the need for therapeutic interventions.\n\nIn summary, endoscopy is a crucial tool in diagnosing and managing UGIB, allowing for direct visualization of the bleeding source and potential therapeutic interventions.
