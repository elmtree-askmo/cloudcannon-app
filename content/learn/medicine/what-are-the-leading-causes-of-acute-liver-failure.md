    What are the leading causes of acute liver failure?
answer: >-
    The leading causes of acute liver failure (ALF) can vary by region, but some of the most common causes include:\n\n1. **Acetaminophen Overdose**: In the United States, acetaminophen (known as paracetamol outside the U.S.) is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure. Overdosing on this medication can lead to severe liver damage.\n\n2. **Viral Hepatitis**: Hepatitis A and E are significant causes of acute liver failure, particularly in developing countries. Hepatitis B can also lead to liver failure, especially in cases of acute infection.\n\n3. **Drug-Induced Liver Injury**: Besides acetaminophen, other medications, including certain antibiotics and antituberculosis drugs, can cause acute liver failure.\n\n4. **Herbal and Dietary Supplements**: Some herbal medications, such as aloe vera, chaparral, comfrey, ephedra, and kava, have been associated with liver toxicity and can lead to acute liver failure.\n\n5. **Cancer**: Primary liver cancer or metastatic cancer that spreads to the liver can result in acute liver failure.\n\n6. **Other Viral Infections**: Rare viral causes of acute liver failure include infections from Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus types 1, 2, and 6.\n\n7. **Hypoxia-Induced Liver Injury**: Conditions that lead to reduced blood flow to the liver can also result in acute liver failure.\n\n8. **Acute Budd-Chiari Syndrome**: This condition, characterized by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, can lead to liver failure.\n\nAcute liver failure is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention, as it can lead to rapid deterioration of liver function and other systemic complications.
