    What are the considerations in choosing between inlay vs. onlay prosthesis in shoulder arthroplasty?
answer: >-
    When considering the choice between inlay and onlay prosthesis designs in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), several factors come into play, including biomechanical properties, clinical outcomes, and specific patient needs.\n\n1. **Design Differences**: The inlay prosthesis is designed to rest within the metaphysis of the humerus, while the onlay prosthesis sits above the anatomic neck. This fundamental difference in positioning can influence the biomechanics of the shoulder joint and the overall stability of the implant.\n\n2. **Biomechanical Considerations**: Studies utilizing biorobotic shoulder simulators have shown that the biomechanical performance of inlay and onlay designs can differ significantly. The onlay design may provide better lateralization of the center of rotation, which can enhance stability and function, particularly in patients with significant rotator cuff deficiencies.\n\n3. **Clinical Outcomes**: Research comparing clinical outcomes, such as range of motion (ROM), pain levels, and Constant scores (CS), indicates that both designs can lead to improvements postoperatively. However, some studies suggest that the onlay design may offer superior outcomes in specific metrics, such as external rotation (ER) ROM.\n\n4. **Indications for Use**: The choice between inlay and onlay prostheses may also depend on the specific indications for surgery. For instance, the onlay design is often preferred in cases where there is a need to preserve tuberosity bone stock, which can be crucial for maintaining shoulder function and reducing the risk of complications.\n\n5. **Complications and Risks**: Both designs carry potential risks and complications, but the onlay design may have advantages in terms of reducing the risk of certain complications associated with bone loss or instability. The preservation of bone stock with the onlay design can be particularly beneficial in revision cases.\n\n6. **Current Trends and Future Directions**: As the field of shoulder arthroplasty continues to evolve, ongoing research is focused on optimizing the designs of both inlay and onlay prostheses. Future innovations may further refine these options, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction.\n\nIn summary, the decision between inlay and onlay prosthesis designs in reverse shoulder arthroplasty should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's specific condition, the biomechanical implications of each design, and the potential for achieving optimal clinical outcomes.
