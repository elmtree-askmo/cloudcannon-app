    Can you describe the detailed anatomy of the skull?
answer: >-
    The detailed anatomy of the skull is a complex structure composed of 22 bones, which can be categorized into two main groups: the cranial bones and the facial bones. \n\n### Cranial Bones\nThe skull's cranial portion, also known as the neurocranium, consists of 8 bones that encase and protect the brain. These bones include:\n1. **Frontal Bone** - Forms the forehead and the upper part of the eye sockets.\n2. **Parietal Bones (2)** - Located on the sides and roof of the skull.\n3. **Temporal Bones (2)** - Found beneath the parietal bones, they house the structures of the ears.\n4. **Occipital Bone** - Forms the back and base of the skull; it contains the foramen magnum, through which the spinal cord passes.\n5. **Sphenoid Bone** - A complex bone that contributes to the base of the skull and the eye sockets.\n6. **Ethmoid Bone** - Located between the eyes, it forms part of the nasal cavity and the orbits.\n\n### Facial Bones\nThe facial skeleton, or viscerocranium, consists of 14 bones that shape the face and support the structures of the mouth and nasal cavity. These bones include:\n1. **Maxillae (2)** - The upper jawbones that hold the upper teeth and form part of the eye sockets.\n2. **Zygomatic Bones (2)** - Also known as the cheekbones.\n3. **Nasal Bones (2)** - Form the bridge of the nose.\n4. **Palatine Bones (2)** - Form part of the hard palate of the mouth and the floor of the nasal cavity.\n5. **Lacrimal Bones (2)** - Small bones forming part of the eye socket.\n6. **Inferior Nasal Conchae (2)** - Located inside the nasal cavity.\n7. **Vomer** - Forms part of the nasal septum.\n8. **Mandible** - The lower jawbone, which is the only movable bone of the skull.\n\n### Sutures\nThe bones of the skull are primarily connected by fibrous joints known as sutures, which allow for slight movement during infancy and childhood. These sutures include the coronal, sagittal, lambdoid, and squamous sutures, among others.\n\n### Function\nThe primary function of the skull is to protect the brain and support the structures of the face. It also houses the sensory organs, including the eyes, ears, and nasal cavity, and provides attachment points for muscles involved in facial expression and mastication (chewing).\n\n### Clinical Significance\nUnderstanding the anatomy of the skull is crucial for clinical and surgical applications, as it is involved in various conditions such as fractures, congenital anomalies, and surgical interventions.\n\nIn summary, the skull is a vital structure composed of 22 bones that serve protective, structural, and functional roles in the human body.
