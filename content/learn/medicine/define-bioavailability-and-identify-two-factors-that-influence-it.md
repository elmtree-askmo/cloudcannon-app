answer: >-
    Bioavailability is defined as the proportion of a drug that enters systemic circulation when introduced into the body and is available for therapeutic effect. It can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\text{Bioavailability} = \frac{\text{Amount of drug in systemic circulation}}{\text{Amount of drug administered}} \times 100\%\n$$\n\nTwo key factors that influence bioavailability are:\n\n1. **Route of Administration**: Different routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, oral, subcutaneous) can significantly affect how much of the drug reaches systemic circulation. For instance, intravenous (IV) medications have 100% bioavailability because they are directly introduced into the bloodstream, while oral medications often have lower bioavailability due to factors such as incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism.\n\n2. **First-Pass Metabolism**: This refers to the metabolism of a drug by the liver before it reaches systemic circulation. Drugs that undergo significant first-pass metabolism may have a reduced bioavailability when taken orally, as a portion of the drug is metabolized and rendered inactive before it can exert its therapeutic effects.\n\nUnderstanding these factors is crucial for optimizing drug therapy and ensuring effective treatment outcomes.
