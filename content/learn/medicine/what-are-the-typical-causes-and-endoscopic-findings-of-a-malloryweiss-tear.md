    What are the typical causes and endoscopic findings of a Mallory-Weiss tear?
answer: >-
    A Mallory-Weiss tear is a mucosal laceration that occurs at the gastroesophageal junction, primarily caused by severe vomiting or retching. This condition typically presents with hematemesis (vomiting of blood) and is often self-limiting. However, in some cases, it may require endoscopic intervention if the bleeding persists.\n\n### Typical Causes\nThe primary causes of a Mallory-Weiss tear include:\n- **Severe Vomiting**: This is the most common trigger, often associated with conditions such as binge drinking, chemotherapy, or any situation that leads to intense retching.\n- **Increased Intra-abdominal Pressure**: Activities that increase pressure in the abdomen, such as heavy lifting or straining, can also contribute.\n\n### Endoscopic Findings\nDuring an endoscopic examination, Mallory-Weiss tears are typically identified as:\n- **Linear Mucosal Tears**: These appear as distinct, linear lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction. They may be seen along the mucosal surface and are often located at the junction where the esophagus meets the stomach.\n- **Stigmata of Recent Hemorrhage**: In some cases, there may be visible vessels or adherent clots at the site of the tear, indicating recent bleeding.\n\n### Management\nWhile many Mallory-Weiss tears resolve spontaneously, persistent bleeding may necessitate endoscopic intervention, which can include cauterization of the bleeding site or other therapeutic measures.\n\nIn summary, Mallory-Weiss tears are primarily caused by severe vomiting and are characterized by linear mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction, which can be identified during endoscopy.
