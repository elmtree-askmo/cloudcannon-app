    How does the fetal period differ from the embryonic period?
answer: >-
    The fetal period and the embryonic period are two distinct stages of prenatal development, each characterized by specific processes and milestones.\n\n1. **Timing**: The embryonic period lasts from conception until the end of the 10th week of pregnancy (approximately 8 weeks after fertilization). In contrast, the fetal period begins at the 11th week of pregnancy and continues until birth, typically lasting around 30 weeks.\n\n2. **Developmental Focus**: During the embryonic period, the primary focus is on the formation of essential body systems and structures. This includes the development of major organs and the basic framework of the body. By the end of this stage, the embryo has established the foundational elements necessary for further growth.\n\n3. **Growth and Maturation**: The fetal period is characterized by significant growth and maturation of the structures that were formed during the embryonic stage. This includes the continued development of organs, bones, and other systems, as well as an increase in size and mass. The fetal stage is crucial for the refinement and functional maturation of these systems, preparing the fetus for life outside the womb.\n\n4. **Physiological Changes**: The fetal period also involves important physiological changes, including the development of the brain and nervous system, which are critical for later cognitive and motor functions. The fetus undergoes rapid growth, and by the end of the first trimester, it can be about 2.5 to 3 inches long.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between the fetal and embryonic periods lie in their timing, developmental focus, and the nature of growth and maturation processes. The embryonic period lays the groundwork for the body's structure, while the fetal period emphasizes growth and the functional development of those structures.
