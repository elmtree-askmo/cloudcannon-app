    How are gallstones detected through radiological imaging?
answer: >-
    Gallstones are primarily detected through radiological imaging, with abdominal ultrasonography (US) being the method of choice due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, exceeding 95%. This non-invasive technique utilizes sound waves to create images of the gallbladder and surrounding structures, allowing for the identification of gallstones as small as 2 mm. The characteristic findings on ultrasound include a highly reflective echo from the anterior surface of the gallstone and the mobility of the stones within the gallbladder.\n\nIn addition to ultrasound, other imaging modalities can also be employed in the detection of gallstones. For instance, dual-energy computed tomography (CT) has been shown to enhance the detection of gallstones through low KV imaging and base substance imaging techniques. However, CT involves ionizing radiation, which is a significant consideration compared to the radiation-free nature of ultrasound.\n\nUltrasound is particularly advantageous because it can be performed at the bedside, is relatively low-cost, and poses no radiation risk to the patient. It is also effective in assessing complications related to gallstones, such as biliary dilatation and conditions like Mirizzi syndrome, where a gallstone impacts the cystic duct, causing obstruction.\n\nIn summary, while abdominal ultrasound remains the most common and effective imaging modality for diagnosing gallstones, CT and other imaging techniques may be utilized in specific cases to provide additional information or confirm findings.
