answer: >-
    Congenital and acquired anatomical abnormalities can significantly affect bladder function and contribute to urinary incontinence. Here are some key abnormalities categorized into congenital and acquired types:\n\n### Congenital Abnormalities\n1. **Ectopic Ureters**: This condition occurs when one or both ureters do not connect to the bladder in the normal position, leading to urinary leakage.\n2. **Bladder Exstrophy**: A rare condition where the bladder is formed outside the body, resulting in significant challenges with bladder control and function.\n3. **Ureterocele**: A cystic dilation of the ureter near its opening into the bladder, which can obstruct urine flow and lead to incontinence.\n4. **Hypospadias**: A condition where the urethral opening is not located at the tip of the penis, which can affect urinary control in males.\n\n### Acquired Abnormalities\n1. **Pelvic Organ Prolapse**: The displacement of pelvic organs (such as the bladder, uterus, or rectum) can lead to stress incontinence, particularly in women.\n2. **Urethral Hypermobility**: Excessive movement of the urethra during physical activities can cause involuntary leakage, often associated with weakened pelvic floor support.\n3. **Intrinsic Sphincter Deficiency**: Weakness or damage to the sphincter mechanism can lead to involuntary leakage of urine.\n4. **Neurogenic Bladder Conditions**: Conditions such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or stroke can disrupt the neural control of bladder function, leading to incontinence.\n5. **Radiation Effects**: Previous radiation therapy can cause fibrosis and scarring of the bladder wall, leading to decreased bladder compliance and function.\n\n### Summary\nBoth congenital and acquired anatomical abnormalities can disrupt normal bladder function and contribute to urinary incontinence. Understanding these conditions is crucial for effective assessment and management of patients experiencing incontinence.
