    Iodine-based contrast media can induce thyroid dysfunction, leading to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism due to excess iodine. Patients with existing thyroid conditions are at higher risk. Management strategies are essential for at-risk individuals.

    What is iodine-based contrast media induced thyroid dysfunction?
answer: >-
    Iodine-based contrast media (ICM) induced thyroid dysfunction refers to the alterations in thyroid function that can occur following the administration of iodine-containing contrast agents used in various radiological examinations. These agents can lead to either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism due to the supraphysiological concentrations of iodine present in the contrast solution.\n\nThe mechanism behind this dysfunction is primarily related to the excess iodide introduced into the body, which can disrupt normal thyroid hormone production. In particular, patients with pre-existing thyroid conditions, such as Graves' disease or thyroid autonomy, are at a higher risk of developing thyrotoxicosis, a condition characterized by excessive thyroid hormone levels. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow syndrome.\n\nRecent guidelines from the European Thyroid Association emphasize the importance of an individualized approach to the prevention and management of ICM-induced thyroid dysfunction. Factors such as the patient's age, clinical symptoms, pre-existing thyroid diseases, coexisting morbidities, and iodine intake should be considered when assessing risk and determining treatment strategies.\n\nIn clinical practice, it is recommended that healthcare providers systematically evaluate thyroid function in patients prior to the administration of ICM, especially in those at high risk for developing thyroid dysfunction. In certain cases, prophylactic treatment with antithyroid medications, such as methimazole or perchlorate, may be considered to mitigate the risk of hyperthyroidism.\n\nOverall, awareness of the potential for ICM-induced thyroid dysfunction is crucial for clinicians, as it can significantly impact patient management and outcomes in the context of diagnostic imaging.
