    What are the symptoms associated with the Winter Bottom Sign?
answer: >-
    The Winterbottom sign is associated with African Sleeping Sickness, which is caused by the Trypanosoma brucei parasite. The primary symptom of the Winterbottom sign is the swelling of lymph nodes, particularly in the neck region. This swelling occurs in response to the infection and is typically located near the site of the bite from the tsetse fly, which is the vector for the parasite.\n\nIn summary, the symptoms associated with the Winterbottom sign include:\n\n- **Swelling of lymph nodes**: This is the hallmark of the Winterbottom sign, indicating an immune response to the Trypanosoma infection.\n- **Location**: The swelling is usually found in the cervical (neck) lymph nodes, but can also occur in other regions depending on the spread of the infection.\n\nThis sign is an important clinical indicator of the disease's progression and can help in diagnosing African Sleeping Sickness.
