answer: >-
    Common diagnostic methods for metastatic liver cancer include a combination of imaging tests, blood tests, and biopsy procedures. Here are the key diagnostic approaches:\n\n1. **Imaging Tests**: \n   - **CT Scans**: Computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently used to detect liver tumors and assess the extent of cancer spread.\n   - **MRI**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed images of the liver and can help identify lesions that may indicate metastasis.\n   - **Ultrasound**: This imaging technique can also be used to visualize liver masses and guide further diagnostic procedures.\n\n2. **Blood Tests**: \n   - While no single blood test can definitively diagnose liver cancer, certain tumor markers can indicate the presence of metastatic disease. For instance, elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may suggest liver cancer, particularly in the context of known primary cancers like germ cell tumors. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can also be relevant in cases of prostate cancer metastasizing to the liver.\n   - Liver function tests may reveal signs of liver dysfunction, which can prompt further investigation.\n\n3. **Biopsy**: \n   - A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a common method used to obtain a tissue sample from the liver. This procedure involves inserting a thin needle into the liver to collect cells for microscopic examination, helping to determine the type and extent of the tumor.\n\n4. **Clinical Examination**: \n   - A thorough physical examination, including assessment of symptoms such as weight loss and hepatomegaly, can raise suspicion for liver metastases, especially in patients with known primary cancers that commonly spread to the liver.\n\n5. **Staging Tests**: \n   - Once liver cancer is diagnosed, staging tests are performed to determine the size, location, and spread of the cancer. This may include additional imaging studies like bone scans if there is suspicion of metastasis to other organs.\n\nThese diagnostic methods are crucial for early detection and effective treatment planning for metastatic liver cancer.
