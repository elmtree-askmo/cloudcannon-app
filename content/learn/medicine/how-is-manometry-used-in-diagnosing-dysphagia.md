    How is manometry used in diagnosing dysphagia?
answer: >-
    Esophageal manometry is a critical diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of dysphagia, particularly when esophageal motility disorders are suspected. This test measures the strength and pattern of muscle contractions in the esophagus, which is essential for determining how well the esophagus is functioning in moving food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\nThe procedure involves the insertion of a pressure-sensitive tube through the nose and into the esophagus. As the patient swallows, the manometry device records the pressure changes and muscle contractions that occur. This data helps identify any abnormalities in esophageal motility, which can manifest as difficulty swallowing or the sensation of food being stuck in the throat.\n\nHigh-resolution manometry (HRM) has advanced the capabilities of traditional manometry, providing more detailed information about esophageal function. It is particularly useful in diagnosing conditions such as achalasia, which is characterized by impaired peristalsis and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.\n\nEsophageal manometry is indicated for patients with nonobstructive dysphagia and is also used in preoperative evaluations for antireflux surgery to assess the adequacy of peristalsis. Overall, manometry plays a vital role in the comprehensive assessment of dysphagia, guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes.
