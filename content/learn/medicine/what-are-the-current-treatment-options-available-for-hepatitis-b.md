    What are the current treatment options available for Hepatitis B?
answer: >-
    Current treatment options for Hepatitis B (HBV) primarily fall into two categories: immune modulators and antiviral agents. \n\n1. **Immune Modulator Drugs**: These include interferon and pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN), which are designed to boost the immune system's ability to fight off the hepatitis B virus. These medications are administered via injection, typically over a period of 6 months to 1 year. While they can be effective, they also come with limitations, including potential side effects and the need for careful patient selection.\n\n2. **Antiviral Agents**: The second category consists of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), which are oral antiviral medications that help control the replication of the virus. In the United States, there are currently five approved oral antiviral medications for chronic hepatitis B, in addition to the two types of injectable interferons. These antiviral agents are effective at achieving viral suppression during treatment, but they do not necessarily lead to a cure, as the virus can reactivate once treatment is stopped.\n\nThe 2024 hepatitis B guidelines emphasize simplified treatment criteria and expanded eligibility for antiviral prophylaxis, particularly for pregnant women, to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV. This reflects a growing recognition of the need for accessible and effective treatment options for all individuals affected by chronic hepatitis B.\n\nIn summary, the main treatment options for hepatitis B include:\n- **Injectable Immune Modulators**: Interferon and Peg-IFN\n- **Oral Antiviral Agents**: Nucleos(t)ide analogs\n\nThese treatments aim to manage the infection and reduce the risk of complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing research is also focused on developing new therapies that may offer a potential cure in the future.
