    Identify the causes and diagnostic features of hydronephrosis.
answer: >-
    Hydronephrosis is a condition characterized by the dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to the accumulation of urine, typically resulting from an obstruction in the urinary tract. If left untreated, hydronephrosis can lead to kidney damage and various complications. Below are the primary causes and diagnostic features associated with hydronephrosis.\n\n### Causes of Hydronephrosis\n\n1. **Ureteropelvic Junction (UPJ) Obstruction**: A common congenital condition where there is a blockage at the junction where the ureter meets the renal pelvis, preventing normal urine flow.\n\n2. **Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV)**: A condition primarily affecting newborn males, where a membranous fold in the posterior urethra causes bladder outlet obstruction, leading to hydronephrosis.\n\n3. **Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR)**: This condition involves the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters, which can lead to increased pressure and hydronephrosis.\n\n4. **Calculi (Kidney Stones)**: Stones can obstruct the ureters, leading to urine accumulation and subsequent hydronephrosis.\n\n5. **Tumors**: Neoplasms in the urinary tract or surrounding structures can compress the ureters, causing obstruction.\n\n6. **Pregnancy**: The growing uterus can exert pressure on the ureters, leading to hydronephrosis, particularly on the right side.\n\n7. **Horseshoe Kidney**: A congenital anomaly where the kidneys are fused at their lower poles, which can lead to obstruction and hydronephrosis.\n\n8. **Strictures**: Narrowing of the ureters due to scarring or inflammation can obstruct urine flow.\n\n### Diagnostic Features of Hydronephrosis\n\n1. **Clinical Symptoms**: Patients may present with flank pain, abdominal pain, urinary frequency, urgency, or hematuria. In severe cases, symptoms of kidney dysfunction may occur.\n\n2. **Imaging Studies**:\n   - **Ultrasound**: The first-line imaging modality for diagnosing hydronephrosis. It can visualize the dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces.\n   - **CT Scan**: Provides detailed images of the urinary tract and can help identify the cause of obstruction, such as stones or tumors.\n   - **MRI**: Occasionally used for further evaluation, especially in complex cases.\n\n3. **Laboratory Tests**: Blood tests may show elevated creatinine levels indicating impaired kidney function. Urinalysis can reveal signs of infection or hematuria.\n\n4. **Urodynamic Studies**: In cases of suspected bladder outlet obstruction, these studies can assess bladder function and pressure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the causes and diagnostic features of hydronephrosis is crucial for timely intervention and management. Early detection through imaging and clinical evaluation can prevent potential kidney damage and associated complications.
