    What are the different types of dominance and recessivity in genetics?
answer: >-
    In genetics, there are three main types of dominance that describe how alleles interact with one another: complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance.\n\n1. **Complete Dominance**: In this scenario, one allele is completely dominant over the other. The dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele, meaning that if an individual inherits at least one copy of the dominant allele, the dominant trait will be expressed in the phenotype. For example, in pea plants, the allele for purple flowers (P) is completely dominant over the allele for white flowers (p). Therefore, both homozygous dominant (PP) and heterozygous (Pp) plants will display purple flowers, while only homozygous recessive (pp) plants will have white flowers.\n\n2. **Incomplete Dominance**: This type occurs when the phenotype of heterozygous individuals is an intermediate blend of the two parent phenotypes. Neither allele is completely dominant, resulting in a third phenotype. For instance, in snapdragon flowers, crossing red-flowered (RR) and white-flowered (WW) plants produces pink-flowered (RW) offspring, demonstrating incomplete dominance.\n\n3. **Codominance**: In codominance, both alleles in a heterozygous individual are fully expressed, resulting in a phenotype that displays characteristics of both alleles simultaneously. A classic example of codominance is seen in the ABO blood group system, where individuals with genotype IAIB express both A and B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells.\n\nUnderstanding these types of dominance is crucial for comprehending how genetic traits are inherited and expressed in individuals. Each type of dominance contributes to the complexity of genetic inheritance and can have significant implications in fields such as medicine and evolutionary biology.
