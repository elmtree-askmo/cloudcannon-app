    Codominant hereditary diseases display simultaneous expression of alleles in individuals, leading to phenotypes that exhibit traits from both alleles, as seen in the ABO blood group system and sickle cell anemia.

    How do codominant hereditary diseases manifest in humans?
answer: >-
    Codominant hereditary diseases manifest in humans through the simultaneous expression of both alleles in a heterozygous individual, resulting in a phenotype that displays characteristics from both alleles. A prominent example of this is seen in the ABO blood group system, where the A and B alleles are codominant. Individuals with one A allele and one B allele express both antigens on their red blood cells, resulting in the AB blood type.\n\nAnother notable example is sickle cell anemia. In this condition, individuals who inherit one normal allele and one sickle cell allele (heterozygous) will have a mixture of normal and sickle-shaped red blood cells. This means that approximately half of their red blood cells will be misshapen, demonstrating the codominance of the alleles, as both normal and sickled shapes are present in the blood.\n\nIn summary, codominant hereditary diseases can be identified by the presence of traits from both alleles in the phenotype, as seen in blood type inheritance and conditions like sickle cell anemia.
