answer: >-
    A case study of acute cholecystitis typically involves a patient presenting with specific clinical symptoms and imaging findings that aid in diagnosis. \n\n**Patient Presentation:**\nA common presentation for acute cholecystitis includes a patient experiencing sudden onset right upper quadrant pain, which may radiate to the shoulder or back. The pain is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fever. For instance, a 25-year-old female patient with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Upon examination, she exhibited tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and her vital signs indicated mild tachycardia and fever.\n\n**Imaging Findings:**\nImaging plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The first-line imaging modality is typically ultrasound (US), which can reveal several characteristic signs. In this case, the ultrasound may show gallbladder wall thickening greater than 3 mm, wall edema, and the presence of gallstones. Additionally, the presence of pericholecystic fluid can be indicative of inflammation.\n\nIf the ultrasound findings are inconclusive, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed. CT imaging can provide a more detailed view and may show similar findings, such as gallbladder distension, wall thickening, and the presence of gallstones. In some cases, a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan may be utilized to assess gallbladder function and confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating non-visualization of the gallbladder.\n\nIn summary, the combination of clinical presentation and imaging findings, particularly ultrasound and CT, is essential for the accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Timely diagnosis and management are critical, as this condition can lead to serious complications if left untreated.
