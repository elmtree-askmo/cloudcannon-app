    When is HBIG indicated in the prevention of Hepatitis B?
answer: >-
    HBIG (Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin) is indicated in the prevention of Hepatitis B in several specific scenarios, primarily as a form of postexposure prophylaxis. Here are the key indications for its use:\n\n1. **Postexposure Prophylaxis**: HBIG is recommended for individuals who have been recently exposed to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) through body fluids. This includes:\n   - **Percutaneous Exposure**: Such as needle-stick injuries.\n   - **Mucocutaneous Exposure**: Contact with mucous membranes.\n   - **Unprotected Sexual Exposure**: Instances where there has been potential sexual transmission.\n   - **Mother-to-Infant Transmission**: Newborns of mothers who are hepatitis B positive should receive HBIG shortly after birth to prevent infection.\n\n2. **Liver Transplantation**: HBIG is used to prevent HBV recurrence in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. It is often administered in combination with antiviral medications, achieving a high efficacy rate in preventing reinfection.\n\n3. **Infants Born to HBsAg-Positive Mothers**: Babies born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive should receive HBIG and the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. This combination is crucial to protect the infant from developing chronic hepatitis B.\n\n4. **Healthcare Workers and First Responders**: Individuals in these professions who have been exposed to HBV through occupational hazards are also candidates for HBIG administration.\n\nIn summary, HBIG is a critical component in the prevention of hepatitis B, particularly in high-risk situations such as postexposure scenarios and for infants born to infected mothers. It is most effective when used in conjunction with the hepatitis B vaccine.
