    List the types of thyroid medications and their common side effects.
answer: >-
    Thyroid medications can be categorized into several types, each with its specific uses and potential side effects. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:\n\n### Types of Thyroid Medications\n\n1. **Thyroid Hormone Replacement Medications**:\n   - **Levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Tirosint)**: This is the most commonly prescribed medication for hypothyroidism. It is a synthetic form of the T4 hormone.\n   - **Liothyronine (Cytomel)**: This is a synthetic form of the T3 hormone and is sometimes used in conjunction with levothyroxine or as an alternative.\n\n2. **Antithyroid Medications**:\n   - **Methimazole (Tapazole)**: Used to treat hyperthyroidism by inhibiting the thyroid gland's ability to produce hormones.\n   - **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**: Another antithyroid medication that also inhibits hormone production but is less commonly used due to its side effect profile.\n\n3. **Radioactive Iodine Therapy**: This treatment involves using radioactive iodine to destroy overactive thyroid cells, commonly used for hyperthyroidism.\n\n4. **Beta Blockers**: While not a thyroid medication per se, beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) are often prescribed to manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as rapid heart rate.\n\n5. **Compounded Thyroid Medications**: These are custom-made medications that may contain a combination of T3 and T4 hormones, but their efficacy and safety can vary.\n\n6. **Over-the-Counter Natural Desiccated Thyroid (NDT)**: This is derived from animal thyroid glands and contains both T3 and T4 hormones.\n\n### Common Side Effects\n\n#### Levothyroxine (T4)\n- **Common Side Effects**:\n  - Heat intolerance\n  - Fast heart rate\n  - Diarrhea\n  - Weight loss\n  - Hair changes\n- **Serious Side Effects**:\n  - Chest pain\n  - Irregular heartbeats\n  - Shortness of breath\n\n#### Liothyronine (T3)\n- **Common Side Effects**:\n  - Similar to levothyroxine, but may have a higher incidence of cardiac side effects, such as arrhythmias, especially if overdosed.\n\n#### Antithyroid Medications (Methimazole and PTU)\n- **Common Side Effects**:\n  - Skin rash\n  - Upset stomach\n  - Drowsiness\n  - Bitter aftertaste\n- **Severe Side Effects**:\n  - Agranulocytosis (a serious drop in white blood cell count)\n  - Liver toxicity (more common with PTU)\n\n#### Radioactive Iodine Therapy\n- **Common Side Effects**:\n  - Temporary increase in thyroid hormone levels (thyroid storm)\n  - Sore throat\n  - Dry mouth\n\n#### Beta Blockers\n- **Common Side Effects**:\n  - Fatigue\n  - Dizziness\n  - Cold extremities\n\n### Conclusion\nIt is essential for patients to discuss potential side effects and interactions of thyroid medications with their healthcare provider to ensure safe and effective treatment. Monitoring and adjusting dosages can help mitigate many of the side effects associated with these medications.
