    Can you explain the differences between infiltrating ductal carcinoma and other types of breast carcinoma?
answer: >-
    Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for 70-80% of all breast cancer cases. It originates in the cells lining the milk ducts and has the potential to invade surrounding breast tissue and metastasize to other parts of the body. IDC is often referred to by several names, including infiltrating ductal carcinoma and invasive carcinoma of no special type.\n\nIn contrast, other types of breast carcinoma, such as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), have distinct characteristics:\n\n1. **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**: This type accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancers. ILC starts in the lobules, which are the glands that produce milk. It is known for its unique histological features and tends to be more difficult to detect on mammograms compared to IDC. ILC is also more endocrine-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant than IDC, and it often has a different metastatic pattern.\n\n2. **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**: While not invasive, DCIS is an important type of breast cancer that occurs when cancer cells form in a breast duct but do not invade surrounding tissue. It is sometimes referred to as stage 0 breast cancer.\n\n3. **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer**: This aggressive form of breast cancer does not express estrogen or progesterone receptors and lacks overexpression of the HER2 protein. It accounts for about 15% of breast cancers and is known for its challenging treatment options.\n\n4. **Special Types of Breast Cancer**: Other less common types include colloid (mucinous), medullary, micropapillary, papillary, and tubular carcinomas. Each of these has unique pathological features and may exhibit different behaviors and responses to treatment.\n\nIn summary, while infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most prevalent type of breast cancer, other types like invasive lobular carcinoma and various special types exhibit distinct biological behaviors, histological characteristics, and treatment responses. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment planning in breast cancer management.
