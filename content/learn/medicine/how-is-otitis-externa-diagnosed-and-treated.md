    How is otitis externa diagnosed and treated?
answer: >-
    Otitis externa, commonly known as swimmer's ear, is an inflammation of the external auditory canal that can be caused by bacterial or fungal infections. The diagnosis and treatment of otitis externa involve several key steps:\n\n### Diagnosis\n1. **Clinical Evaluation**: Otitis externa is primarily diagnosed through a clinical evaluation, which includes a thorough history and physical examination. Symptoms often include ear pain, tenderness, itching, aural fullness, and sometimes hearing loss. The onset of these symptoms is typically rapid.\n2. **Inspection**: During the physical examination, healthcare providers may inspect the ear canal for signs of inflammation, discharge, and any potential obstruction. The presence of cerumen (earwax) can also be assessed, as it plays a protective role in the ear canal.\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**: It is important to differentiate otitis externa from other ear conditions, such as otitis media or other infections, which may require different management strategies.\n\n### Treatment\n1. **Aural Toilet**: Although not always performed in primary care settings, aural toilet (cleansing of the ear canal) is recommended to remove debris and discharge, which can help in the healing process.\n2. **Medications**: The mainstay of treatment for otitis externa is the use of antibiotic ear drops, which may also contain steroids or anti-inflammatory medications to reduce inflammation and pain. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include those effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which are frequent culprits in bacterial infections.\n3. **Avoidance of Water Exposure**: Patients are advised to keep the ear dry and avoid water exposure during the treatment period to prevent further irritation or infection.\n4. **Management of Complications**: In cases of persistent otitis externa or if there are signs of more severe conditions (such as malignant otitis externa), a longer course of antibiotics (4 to 6 weeks) may be necessary, and further evaluation may be warranted.\n\n### Interprofessional Approach\nManagement of otitis externa is often best handled by an interprofessional team, including primary care providers, otolaryngologists, and nursing staff, to ensure comprehensive care and follow-up.\n\nIn summary, the diagnosis of otitis externa relies on clinical evaluation and inspection, while treatment focuses on cleaning the ear canal, using appropriate medications, and advising patients on care practices to promote healing and prevent recurrence.
