    What are the clinical manifestations of nephritic syndromes?
answer: >-
    Nephritic syndrome is characterized by a specific set of clinical manifestations resulting from inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys. The key clinical features of nephritic syndrome include:\n\n1. **Hematuria**: The presence of blood in the urine, which can be visible (gross hematuria) or detected only under a microscope (microscopic hematuria). This occurs due to damage to the glomerular capillaries, allowing red blood cells to leak into the urine.\n\n2. **Hypertension**: Elevated blood pressure is common in nephritic syndrome, often due to fluid retention and increased vascular resistance resulting from kidney dysfunction.\n\n3. **Mild Proteinuria**: While nephritic syndrome does involve proteinuria, it is typically less severe than that seen in nephronic syndrome. The protein levels in the urine are usually less than 3.5 grams per day.\n\n4. **Edema**: Swelling can occur, particularly in the face and around the eyes, due to fluid retention, although it is generally less pronounced than in nephronic syndrome.\n\n5. **Oliguria**: A decrease in urine output may occur due to impaired kidney function.\n\n6. **Other Symptoms**: Patients may also experience symptoms related to the underlying cause of the nephritic syndrome, such as fever, malaise, or joint pain, particularly in cases associated with infections or autoimmune diseases.\n\nNephritic syndrome can be caused by various conditions, including post-infectious glomerulonephritis (often following streptococcal infections), IgA nephropathy, and lupus nephritis, among others. Understanding these clinical manifestations is crucial for diagnosing and managing kidney diseases effectively.
