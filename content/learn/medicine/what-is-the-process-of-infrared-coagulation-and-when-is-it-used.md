    What is the process of infrared coagulation, and when is it used?
answer: >-
    Infrared coagulation (IRC) is a non-surgical outpatient procedure primarily used to treat small- and medium-sized internal hemorrhoids. The process involves the use of a specialized device that emits an intense beam of infrared light. This light generates heat, which is directed at the hemorrhoids through a small probe.\n\nDuring the procedure, the infrared light causes the blood vessels supplying the hemorrhoids to coagulate, effectively cutting off their blood supply. This leads to the formation of scar tissue, which results in the shrinkage of the hemorrhoids. The treatment is typically quick and can be performed in a doctor's office, often immediately following a colonoscopy while the patient is still sedated.\n\nIRC is particularly beneficial for patients seeking a minimally invasive option for hemorrhoid treatment, as it is generally painless and allows most individuals to return to their normal activities the same day. The procedure is specifically indicated for internal hemorrhoids and is not suitable for external hemorrhoids.\n\nOverall, infrared coagulation is recognized for its effectiveness and safety, making it a popular choice among healthcare providers for managing hemorrhoidal conditions.
