    What are some examples of autosomal recessive hereditary diseases in humans?
answer: >-
    Some examples of autosomal recessive hereditary diseases in humans include:\n\n1. **Cystic Fibrosis**: This condition is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to the production of thick mucus that can obstruct the lungs and pancreas, resulting in respiratory and digestive issues.\n\n2. **Sickle Cell Disease**: This group of disorders affects hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. The disease can cause episodes of pain, increased risk of infections, and other serious complications.\n\n3. **Tay-Sachs Disease**: This is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain and spinal cord, which results in severe neurological impairment.\n\n4. **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: This metabolic disorder is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause intellectual disability and other serious health problems if not managed through diet.\n\nThese disorders require that an individual inherits two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to manifest symptoms. Carriers, who have only one copy of the mutated gene, typically do not show symptoms.
