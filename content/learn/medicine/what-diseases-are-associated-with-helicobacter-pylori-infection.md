    What diseases are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection?
answer: >-
    Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal system, but also linked to some extragastric conditions. The most well-documented diseases associated with H. pylori infection include:\n\n1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: H. pylori is a significant causal factor for both gastric and duodenal ulcers. It damages the protective lining of the stomach and small intestine, leading to ulcer formation in approximately 10% of infected individuals.\n\n2. **Chronic Gastritis**: The infection often leads to chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, known as chronic gastritis, which can progress to more severe conditions.\n\n3. **Gastric Adenocarcinoma**: There is a strong association between H. pylori infection and the development of non-cardia gastric cancer. The bacterium is considered a major risk factor for this type of cancer.\n\n4. **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma**: H. pylori infection has been linked to the development of MALT lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic tissue in the stomach.\n\nIn addition to these gastrointestinal diseases, recent studies have suggested associations between H. pylori and various extragastric disorders, including:\n\n- **Cardiovascular Diseases**: Some research indicates a potential link between H. pylori infection and cardiovascular conditions, possibly due to the activation of inflammatory mediators.\n- **Skin Disorders**: Certain skin conditions have also been associated with H. pylori infection.\n- **Rheumatic Diseases**: There is emerging evidence suggesting a connection between H. pylori and some rheumatic diseases.\n- **Liver Diseases**: Some studies have explored the relationship between H. pylori and liver conditions, although more research is needed in this area.\n\nOverall, while H. pylori is primarily known for its role in gastrointestinal diseases, its potential impact on various extragastric conditions is an area of ongoing research.
