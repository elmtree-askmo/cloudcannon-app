    How do the axillary and brachial arteries contribute to blood supply in the upper extremities?
answer: >-
    The axillary and brachial arteries play crucial roles in supplying blood to the upper extremities. \n\nThe axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery and begins at the outer border of the first rib, traveling through the axilla (armpit area). It is responsible for delivering oxygen-rich blood to the shoulder, upper arm, and parts of the chest wall. The axillary artery is divided into three parts based on its anatomical relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle, and it gives off several branches that supply blood to the surrounding muscles, bones, and skin of the shoulder and upper limb.\n\nAs the axillary artery descends, it transitions into the brachial artery at the lower border of the teres major muscle. The brachial artery is the main artery of the upper arm and continues down the arm, where it supplies oxygenated blood to the muscles, bones, and other tissues of the arm. Just distal to the elbow joint, the brachial artery bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries. These two arteries further supply blood to the forearm and hand, ensuring that all parts of the upper limb receive adequate blood flow.\n\nIn summary, the axillary artery primarily supplies the shoulder and upper arm, while the brachial artery extends this supply down the arm and branches into the radial and ulnar arteries, which serve the forearm and hand. Together, they ensure that the upper extremities receive the necessary oxygen and nutrients for proper function.
