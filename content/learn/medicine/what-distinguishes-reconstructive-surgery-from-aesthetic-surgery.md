    What distinguishes reconstructive surgery from aesthetic surgery?
answer: >-
    Reconstructive surgery and aesthetic (or cosmetic) surgery are two distinct branches of plastic surgery, each with its own purpose and goals.\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Reconstructive Surgery**: The primary aim of reconstructive surgery is to restore normal function and appearance to parts of the body that have been affected by congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease. It focuses on correcting abnormalities and restoring the form and function of the affected area.\n   - **Aesthetic Surgery**: In contrast, aesthetic surgery is performed solely to enhance a person's appearance. It is not medically necessary and is often driven by personal or societal ideals of beauty. The goal is to improve the patient's aesthetic appeal, which may include procedures like facelifts, breast augmentations, and liposuction.\n\n2. **Functional vs. Aesthetic Goals**:\n   - Reconstructive surgery emphasizes functional restoration, meaning it aims to improve the functionality of a body part that may have been compromised. For example, reconstructive surgery can help restore the ability to use a limb or improve the appearance of a scar from an injury.\n   - Aesthetic surgery, on the other hand, focuses on achieving a desired look, which may not necessarily involve any functional improvement. It is about enhancing beauty rather than correcting a defect or restoring function.\n\n3. **Examples**:\n   - **Reconstructive Surgery**: Common procedures include breast reconstruction after mastectomy, cleft lip and palate repair, and skin grafts for burn victims.\n   - **Aesthetic Surgery**: Common procedures include rhinoplasty (nose reshaping), lip fillers, and tummy tucks.\n\nIn summary, while both reconstructive and aesthetic surgeries are performed by plastic surgeons, they serve different purposes: reconstructive surgery aims to restore function and normal appearance, while aesthetic surgery focuses on enhancing appearance.
