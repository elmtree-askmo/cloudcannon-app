    What are the gastrointestinal causes of nausea and vomiting?
answer: >-
    Nausea and vomiting can arise from a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) causes. Here are some of the primary gastrointestinal conditions that can lead to these symptoms:\n\n1. **Gastroenteritis**: Often referred to as the "stomach flu," gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, typically caused by viral or bacterial infections. It is one of the most common causes of nausea and vomiting.\n\n2. **Peptic Ulcers**: These are sores that develop on the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. They can cause significant discomfort and lead to nausea and vomiting.\n\n3. **Gastritis**: This condition involves inflammation of the stomach lining, which can result in nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\n4. **Gastroparesis**: A motility disorder that affects the stomach muscles and prevents proper stomach emptying. This condition can lead to nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food.\n\n5. **Food Poisoning**: Ingestion of contaminated food can lead to nausea and vomiting as the body attempts to expel the harmful substances.\n\n6. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: This functional GI disorder can cause a range of symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by bloating and cramping.\n\n7. **Crohnâ€™s Disease**: An autoimmune condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\n8. **Obstruction**: Any blockage in the intestines can lead to nausea and vomiting as the body tries to clear the obstruction.\n\n9. **Medications**: Certain medications, including chemotherapy agents and anesthetics, can induce nausea and vomiting as side effects.\n\n10. **Systemic Conditions**: While not strictly GI-related, systemic conditions that affect the body can also lead to nausea and vomiting, including metabolic disorders and infections.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if nausea and vomiting persist for an extended period, as they can be indicative of underlying health issues that may require treatment.
