    What CT imaging findings are associated with acute cholecystitis?
answer: >-
    In the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis using computed tomography (CT), several key imaging findings are typically observed:\n\n1. **Dilated Gallbladder**: The gallbladder becomes distended due to obstruction, resembling an inflated balloon compared to a normal gallbladder.\n\n2. **Thickened, Irregular Gallbladder Wall**: The wall of the gallbladder shows significant thickening and may appear irregular, indicating inflammation.\n\n3. **Pericholecystic Stranding and Fluid**: There is often inflammatory stranding in the surrounding fatty tissue, along with the presence of fluid around the gallbladder, which suggests inflammation.\n\nThese findings are critical for establishing a confident diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. CT is noted for its high specificity (96.0%) in identifying acute gangrenous cholecystitis, although it has lower sensitivity (29.3%). In cases of acalculous cholecystitis, the CT findings are similar to those of calculous cholecystitis, but without the presence of gallstones.\n\nWhile ultrasound is generally the preferred initial imaging modality for acute cholecystitis, CT can be particularly useful in cases where ultrasound results are inconclusive or when there is a need to evaluate for complications associated with the condition. It is important to interpret CT findings with caution and consider follow-up imaging if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative results. \n\nOverall, familiarity with these CT findings is essential for healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of acute cholecystitis.
