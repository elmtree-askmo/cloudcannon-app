    What is Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) and when is it indicated?
answer: >-
    Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure primarily used to treat achalasia, a swallowing disorder characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, making it difficult for food and liquids to pass into the stomach. The procedure involves the division of the inner circular muscle layer of the lower esophageal sphincter through a submucosal tunnel created by the endoscope. This technique allows for the relaxation of the sphincter, thereby improving the passage of food and liquids.\n\nPOEM was first described in 2008 and has since become a widely adopted treatment option for achalasia. It is considered an endoluminal procedure, meaning it is performed within the lumen of the esophagus without the need for external incisions, which distinguishes it from traditional surgical methods like Heller myotomy.\n\nIndications for POEM include:\n1. **Achalasia Types**: It is indicated for all types of achalasia, including type I (classic), type II (with esophageal dilation), and type III (spastic).\n2. **Failed Prior Treatments**: Patients who have not responded to other treatments, such as pneumatic dilation or botulinum toxin injections, may be candidates for POEM.\n3. **Symptoms**: Patients typically present with symptoms such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and chest pain, and esophageal manometry may show an absence of peristalsis.\n\nOverall, POEM is recognized for its effectiveness in alleviating symptoms associated with achalasia and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.
