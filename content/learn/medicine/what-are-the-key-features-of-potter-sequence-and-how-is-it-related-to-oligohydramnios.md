    What are the key features of Potter sequence, and how is it related to oligohydramnios?
answer: >-
    Potter sequence, also known as Potter's syndrome, is a condition characterized by a specific set of physical abnormalities that arise primarily due to oligohydramnios, which is a deficiency of amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The key features of Potter sequence include:\n\n1. **Pulmonary Hypoplasia**: This is the underdevelopment of the lungs, which occurs because the fetus relies on amniotic fluid for lung development. Insufficient fluid leads to inadequate expansion of the lungs.\n\n2. **Facial Deformities**: These can include a flattened face (flattened nasal bridge), low-set ears, and other craniofacial abnormalities.\n\n3. **Limb Deformities**: This may manifest as limb deformities or positional abnormalities, often referred to as "club feet" or other skeletal malformations.\n\n4. **Other Associations**: Potter sequence is often associated with congenital renal malformations such as renal agenesis (absence of one or both kidneys), posterior urethral valves (which can obstruct urine flow), and conditions like autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).\n\nThe relationship between Potter sequence and oligohydramnios is critical. Oligohydramnios leads to reduced fetal urine production, which is essential for maintaining normal amniotic fluid levels. When the fetal kidneys are unable to produce sufficient urine—due to congenital issues or other factors—this results in decreased amniotic fluid, which in turn contributes to the development of the physical abnormalities seen in Potter sequence. \n\nIn summary, Potter sequence is a direct consequence of oligohydramnios, with its key features being pulmonary hypoplasia, facial and limb deformities, and associations with various renal pathologies.
