    What non-surgical treatments are available for benign thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Non-surgical treatments available for benign thyroid nodules include:\n\n1. **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**: RFA is a minimally invasive procedure that uses heat generated by radio waves to shrink benign thyroid nodules. It has been approved as a non-surgical option and can be performed in a doctor's office without the need for general anesthesia. This method has shown effectiveness and safety in treating benign thyroid nodules, making it a viable alternative to surgery.\n\n2. **Ethanol Injection**: This technique is primarily used for cystic or predominantly cystic benign thyroid nodules. It involves draining the cyst of fluid under ultrasound guidance and then injecting ethanol back into the cyst. The ethanol causes the walls of the cyst to adhere to each other, which helps prevent recurrence.\n\n3. **Watchful Waiting**: In cases where the nodule is noncancerous and not causing significant symptoms, doctors may recommend a watchful waiting approach. This involves regular monitoring through physical exams and thyroid function tests to ensure that the nodule does not grow or cause problems.\n\nThese non-surgical options provide alternatives to traditional surgical approaches, especially for patients who may wish to avoid the risks and recovery associated with surgery.
