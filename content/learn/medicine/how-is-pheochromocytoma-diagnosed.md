    How is pheochromocytoma diagnosed?
answer: >-
    Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor that primarily arises from chromaffin cells in the adrenal glands. Diagnosing pheochromocytoma involves a combination of biochemical tests, imaging studies, and clinical evaluation.\n\n### Biochemical Diagnosis\nThe cornerstone of pheochromocytoma diagnosis is the measurement of catecholamines and their metabolites in the blood and urine. The following tests are commonly used:\n\n1. **24-Hour Urine Collection**: This test measures the total catecholamines and their metabolites, such as metanephrines. It is often considered superior to plasma tests because pheochromocytomas can secrete catecholamines intermittently, and the short half-life of these hormones may lead to normal plasma levels during the testing period. The sensitivity of this test is approximately 87.5%.\n\n2. **Plasma Metanephrine Testing**: This test has a high sensitivity (around 96%) for detecting pheochromocytoma but a lower specificity (about 85%). It measures metanephrines, which are breakdown products of catecholamines, in the blood.\n\n3. **Additional Tests**: Other tests may include measuring platelet norepinephrine levels and using MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy, which can help visualize the tumor. MIBG scintigraphy has a sensitivity of about 83.7%.\n\n### Imaging Studies\nImaging plays a crucial role in localizing the tumor once biochemical tests suggest pheochromocytoma:\n\n1. **Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: These morphological imaging methods are primarily used to identify adrenal masses and assess the size and extent of the tumor.\n\n2. **Functional Imaging**: Techniques such as MIBG scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET) can be employed to evaluate the functional activity of the tumor and detect metastases.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\nPheochromocytoma can present with a variety of symptoms due to excessive catecholamine release, including paroxysmal or sustained hypertension, palpitations, sweating, and anxiety. The clinical presentation can be dramatic, and in some cases, it may mimic other conditions, making recognition challenging.\n\n### Genetic Testing\nIn cases of syndromic pheochromocytoma, where there is a family history or associated genetic conditions, genetic testing may be recommended to identify hereditary syndromes that predispose individuals to pheochromocytoma.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is multifaceted, relying on biochemical tests to confirm excessive catecholamine production, imaging studies for localization, and clinical evaluation of symptoms. Early diagnosis is crucial, as untreated pheochromocytoma can lead to severe complications, including hypertensive crises.
