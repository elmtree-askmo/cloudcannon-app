answer: >-
    CT and MRI images of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically exhibit several key characteristics that are crucial for diagnosis and differentiation from other liver lesions. \n\n1. **CT Imaging**:\n   - **Arterial Phase Hyperenhancement**: HCC lesions are often hypervascular, showing significant enhancement during the arterial phase of contrast-enhanced CT scans. This is due to the tumor's rich blood supply.\n   - **Washout Appearance**: Following the arterial phase, HCC typically demonstrates a washout effect in the portal venous or delayed phases. This means that the tumor appears less enhanced compared to the surrounding liver tissue as the contrast agent is cleared.\n   - **Pseudocapsule**: A thin rim of enhancement may be seen surrounding the tumor, known as a pseudocapsule, which can help in identifying the lesion.\n   - **Mosaic Pattern**: The presence of a mosaic pattern within the tumor can also be indicative of HCC.\n\n2. **MRI Imaging**:\n   - **Dynamic Imaging**: MRI, particularly with the use of hepatobiliary contrast agents like Gd-EOB-DTPA, allows for detailed imaging of HCC. The hepatocyte-phase imaging can start 10-20 minutes post-injection, providing additional insights into the tumor's characteristics.\n   - **Arterial Phase Hyperenhancement and Washout**: Similar to CT, MRI shows hyperenhancement during the arterial phase followed by washout in the portal venous or delayed phases. This temporal enhancement pattern is highly specific for HCC, especially in patients with cirrhosis or other risk factors.\n   - **Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)**: This technique can enhance the detection of smaller tumors, providing additional diagnostic information.\n\nOverall, the combination of these imaging characteristics—arterial phase hyperenhancement, washout in later phases, and the presence of a pseudocapsule—provides a near 100% specificity for diagnosing HCC in patients with underlying liver disease. However, it is important to note that while CT and MRI are effective for larger nodular HCCs, they may have limited sensitivity for early-stage or small tumors, making the use of advanced imaging techniques essential for comprehensive evaluation.
