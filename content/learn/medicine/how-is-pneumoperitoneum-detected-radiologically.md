    How is pneumoperitoneum detected radiologically?
answer: >-
    Pneumoperitoneum, the abnormal presence of air in the peritoneal cavity, is primarily detected through various radiological imaging techniques. The most common methods include plain radiography, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT).\n\n1. **Plain Radiography**: This is often the first-line imaging modality for detecting pneumoperitoneum. The presence of free air can be identified under the diaphragm on upright abdominal radiographs. In left lateral decubitus views, free air may be seen between the free edge of the liver and the lateral wall of the peritoneal cavity. Studies have shown that plain radiography has a sensitivity of approximately 79% and a specificity of 64% for detecting pneumoperitoneum, with a positive predictive value of 96%.\n\n2. **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound imaging is another effective method for detecting pneumoperitoneum, particularly due to its non-invasive nature. It has been found to have a higher sensitivity of 93% compared to plain radiography, while maintaining a comparable specificity of 64% and a positive predictive value of 97%. The standard technique involves placing a high-frequency linear-array transducer in the right upper quadrant, where free air is most likely to accumulate. The detection of the 'gut point'—the transition from abdominal wall sliding to lack thereof—can be a pathognomonic finding for pneumoperitoneum.\n\n3. **Computed Tomography (CT)**: CT is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumoperitoneum due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It provides detailed images that can reveal the relationship between abdominal organs and the peritoneum, making it particularly useful in complex cases or when other imaging modalities are inconclusive.\n\nIn summary, pneumoperitoneum can be effectively detected using a combination of imaging techniques, with each modality offering unique advantages. The choice of imaging should be guided by the clinical context, patient condition, and the need for rapid diagnosis, especially in cases of suspected gastrointestinal perforation.
