    What is the histological structure of follicular cells in the thyroid?
answer: >-
    The histological structure of thyroid follicular cells, also known as thyroid epithelial cells or thyrocytes, is characterized by several key features that are essential for their function in hormone production and secretion.\n\n1. **Cell Arrangement**: Follicular cells form a single layer of cuboidal epithelium that lines the spherical thyroid follicles. These follicles are the structural and functional units of the thyroid gland, surrounding a central lumen filled with colloid, which primarily contains thyroglobulin, a glycoprotein precursor to thyroid hormones.\n\n2. **Cell Shape and Size**: The shape of follicular cells can vary depending on their activity level. When active, they typically appear as cuboidal to low columnar cells, while they may become more flattened (squamous) when inactive.\n\n3. **Cytoplasmic Organelles**: Follicular cells are rich in organelles that support their secretory function:\n   - **Granular Endoplasmic Reticulum**: Abundant in these cells, facilitating the synthesis of proteins, including thyroid hormones.\n   - **Golgi Apparatus**: Well-developed, playing a crucial role in the processing and packaging of hormones.\n   - **Lysosomes**: Prominent, involved in the degradation of materials within the cell.\n   - **Mitochondria**: Small in size, providing the necessary energy for cellular activities.\n\n4. **Microvilli and Junctions**: The apical surface of follicular cells features microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption. Additionally, they have well-developed desmosomes that provide structural integrity and facilitate communication between adjacent cells.\n\n5. **Nuclear Characteristics**: The nuclei of follicular cells are typically round with homogeneous chromatin, indicating a high level of metabolic activity.\n\n6. **Basolateral Membrane**: This membrane contains receptors for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is crucial for regulating the activity of these cells. The basolateral side faces the capillary blood supply, allowing for efficient hormone release into the bloodstream.\n\nIn summary, thyroid follicular cells are specialized epithelial cells that play a vital role in the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, characterized by their cuboidal shape, rich organelle content, and structural adaptations that support their endocrine function.
