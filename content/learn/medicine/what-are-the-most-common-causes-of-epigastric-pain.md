    What are the most common causes of epigastric pain?
answer: >-
    Epigastric pain, which is felt in the middle of the upper abdomen between the ribs and the bellybutton, can arise from various causes. Here are some of the most common causes of epigastric pain:\n\n1. **Acid Reflux and GERD**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, leading to pain, especially when lying down after eating.\n\n2. **Gastritis**: This condition involves inflammation of the stomach lining, which can cause severe epigastric pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.\n\n3. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: Both gastric and duodenal ulcers can lead to epigastric pain. Gastric ulcers typically cause pain shortly after eating, while duodenal ulcers may cause pain a few hours after meals.\n\n4. **Indigestion (Dyspepsia)**: Indigestion is characterized by discomfort or pain in the upper abdomen, often occurring after meals.\n\n5. **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas can result in severe epigastric pain, which may radiate to the back.\n\n6. **Gallstones**: The presence of gallstones can lead to complications such as cholecystitis, which may cause epigastric pain.\n\n7. **Muscle Strain**: Strain from physical activities, such as lifting or exercise, can lead to muscle pain in the upper abdomen.\n\n8. **Cardiac Issues**: Conditions such as a heart attack can sometimes present with epigastric pain, making it crucial to consider cardiac causes in differential diagnoses.\n\n9. **Lactose Intolerance**: This digestive issue can lead to discomfort and pain in the epigastric region after consuming dairy products.\n\n10. **Esophagitis**: Inflammation of the esophagus can also cause pain in the epigastric area.\n\nThese causes highlight the importance of a thorough evaluation when a patient presents with epigastric pain, as the underlying issues can range from benign to serious.
