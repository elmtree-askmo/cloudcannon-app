    What are the different staging systems used in cancer management?
answer: >-
    In cancer management, various staging systems are utilized to classify the extent of cancer based on specific criteria. The most commonly used staging systems include:\n\n1. **TNM Staging System**: This is the most widely recognized system, maintained by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). It evaluates three key components:\n   - **T (Tumor)**: Describes the size and extent of the primary tumor.\n   - **N (Nodes)**: Indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.\n   - **M (Metastasis)**: Assesses whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.\n\n2. **AJCC Staging**: This system is closely related to the TNM system and provides a comprehensive framework for staging various types of cancer, incorporating the TNM classifications.\n\n3. **FIGO Staging**: Primarily used for gynecological cancers, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system categorizes cancer based on the extent of the disease and is particularly relevant for cancers of the female reproductive system.\n\n4. **WHO Grading System**: This system is often used for central nervous system (CNS) tumors and provides a grading scale based on the histological characteristics of the tumor.\n\n5. **Durie-Salmon System**: Specifically designed for multiple myeloma, this system assesses the extent of the disease based on clinical and laboratory findings.\n\n6. **Ann Arbor System**: This system is used for staging Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (excluding mycosis fungoides and SÃ©zary syndrome) and categorizes the disease based on the involvement of lymph nodes and other organs.\n\n7. **SEER Summary Staging**: Developed by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, this simpler system is often used for statistical purposes and provides a broad overview of cancer stages.\n\nEach of these systems serves specific types of cancer and helps healthcare providers in planning treatment strategies, prognostication, and comparing therapeutic outcomes across different patient populations. However, it is important to note that cancer staging is not without limitations, including the potential for understaging or overstaging due to individual variations in disease presentation.
