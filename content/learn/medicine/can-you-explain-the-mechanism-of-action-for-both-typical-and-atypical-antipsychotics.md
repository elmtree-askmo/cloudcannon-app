answer: >-
    The mechanism of action for typical and atypical antipsychotics differs significantly, which contributes to their varying efficacy and side effect profiles.\n\n### Typical Antipsychotics\nTypical antipsychotics, also known as first-generation antipsychotics, primarily function as dopamine receptor antagonists. They inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. This action is effective in reducing positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions. However, typical antipsychotics also exhibit additional blocking properties, including noradrenergic, cholinergic, and histaminergic pathways. This broad receptor activity can lead to various side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tardive dyskinesia, which are more common with this class of medications.\n\n### Atypical Antipsychotics\nAtypical antipsychotics, or second-generation antipsychotics, have a more complex mechanism of action. They act as both dopamine and serotonin antagonists, primarily blocking D2 dopamine receptors and the 5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors. This dual action allows atypical antipsychotics to provide a broader spectrum of symptom relief, addressing both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Additionally, the multireceptor activity of atypical antipsychotics, which may include blockade of Î±1 adrenergic and Î±2 adrenergic receptors, contributes to their unique clinical profiles and generally lower risk of movement disorders compared to typical antipsychotics.\n\nIn summary, while typical antipsychotics mainly target dopamine receptors, atypical antipsychotics engage multiple neurotransmitter systems, which can lead to improved efficacy and a reduced incidence of certain side effects, particularly movement-related disorders.
