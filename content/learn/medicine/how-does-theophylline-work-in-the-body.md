    How does theophylline work in the body?
answer: >-
    Theophylline is a medication primarily used as a bronchodilator to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Its mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving several biochemical pathways:\n\n1. **Phosphodiesterase Inhibition**: Theophylline inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within cells. Elevated cAMP levels result in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, thereby dilating the airways and improving airflow.\n\n2. **Adenosine Receptor Blockade**: Theophylline also blocks adenosine receptors, which can contribute to its bronchodilator effects. Adenosine typically promotes bronchoconstriction, so blocking its action helps to keep the airways open.\n\n3. **Anti-inflammatory Effects**: Recent studies have shown that theophylline has anti-inflammatory properties, which may be beneficial in managing asthma and COPD. It can reverse corticosteroid resistance, particularly in severe cases where histone deacetylase-2 activity is reduced. This suggests that theophylline may enhance the effectiveness of corticosteroids in treating inflammation in the airways.\n\n4. **Calcium Uptake**: Theophylline may increase cellular calcium uptake, which is involved in smooth muscle contraction and relaxation processes.\n\n5. **Immunomodulatory Effects**: Theophylline has been shown to influence immune function, which may play a role in its therapeutic effects in asthma management.\n\nOverall, theophylline is administered either orally in extended-release formulations for chronic management or intravenously for acute exacerbations. While it has been used for over 80 years, its use has declined with the advent of more effective inhaled medications, but it remains a valuable option in certain cases, particularly for patients who do not respond adequately to other treatments. Regular monitoring of blood levels is often necessary due to its narrow therapeutic range and potential side effects.
