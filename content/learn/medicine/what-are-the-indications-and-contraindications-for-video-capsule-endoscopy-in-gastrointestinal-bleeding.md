    What are the indications and contraindications for video capsule endoscopy in gastrointestinal bleeding?
answer: >-
    Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a valuable non-invasive diagnostic tool used primarily for visualizing the small intestine. Here are the indications and contraindications for its use in the context of gastrointestinal bleeding:\n\n### Indications for Video Capsule Endoscopy\n1. **Obscure Gastrointestinal Bleeding**: VCE is particularly useful for identifying sources of bleeding that are not visible through traditional endoscopy.\n2. **Small Bowel Pathologies**: It can help diagnose conditions such as:\n   - Small bowel Crohn's disease\n   - Celiac disease\n   - Hereditary polyposis syndrome\n3. **Evaluation of Small Bowel Ulcers**: VCE can visualize ulcers and other lesions in the small intestine that may be causing bleeding.\n\n### Contraindications for Video Capsule Endoscopy\n1. **Suspected Gastrointestinal Obstruction**: If there is a suspicion of obstruction, VCE is contraindicated as it may lead to complications such as capsule retention.\n2. **Strictures**: Patients with strictures, particularly those with Crohn's disease, should avoid VCE due to the risk of the capsule becoming lodged.\n3. **Swallowing Disorders**: Patients who have difficulty swallowing may not be suitable candidates for VCE, although in some cases, the capsule can be introduced into the stomach using an endoscope.\n4. **Severe Comorbidities**: Patients with significant comorbid conditions that may complicate the procedure or its outcomes should be carefully evaluated before proceeding with VCE.\n5. **Non-cooperative Patients**: Individuals who are unable to cooperate during the procedure may not be suitable candidates for VCE.\n\n### Complications\nOne of the most concerning complications of VCE is capsule retention, especially in patients with small bowel strictures. If retention occurs, it can be diagnosed through abdominal X-ray or CT imaging.\n\nIn summary, video capsule endoscopy is a powerful tool for diagnosing obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and related small bowel conditions, but careful consideration of contraindications is essential to avoid complications.
