    How does Akathisia manifest in patients and what are the treatment options?
answer: >-
    Akathisia is a movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion. It is most commonly associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, particularly when a patient has recently started treatment or had their dosage increased. Symptoms of akathisia can manifest as excessive movement, such as pacing, fidgeting, or an inability to sit still, which can be distressing for patients.\n\nThe condition can also arise from the reduction of dosage or cessation of antipsychotic medication, known as withdrawal akathisia. It is important to note that akathisia can also occur with certain antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and may be linked to other factors such as anxiety disorders or drug withdrawal.\n\nTreatment options for akathisia primarily focus on adjusting the medication regimen. The most effective strategies include:\n\n1. **Medication Adjustment**: Reducing the dose of the antipsychotic or switching to a second-generation antipsychotic that is less likely to induce akathisia can be beneficial.\n\n2. **Adjunctive Medications**: If changing the antipsychotic is not feasible, adjunctive treatments may be considered. The acronym "B-CALM" can help remember the options:\n   - **B**eta-blockers (e.g., propranolol)\n   - **C**lonazepam\n   - **A**nticholinergics\n   - **L**onidine\n   - **M**irtazapine\n\nAmong these, propranolol has the most evidence supporting its use for managing akathisia symptoms. Other options like mirtazapine, biperiden, and vitamin B6 have also shown efficacy in some cases.\n\nPatient education about akathisia, its causes, and treatment options is crucial for effective management. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of akathisia, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate evaluation and management.
