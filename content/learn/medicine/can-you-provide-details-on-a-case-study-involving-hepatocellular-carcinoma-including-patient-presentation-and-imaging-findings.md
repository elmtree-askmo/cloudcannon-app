    A case study involving hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can illustrate the typical patient presentation and imaging findings associated with this condition. \n\n**Patient Presentation:**\nA 55-year-old male presented with symptoms of abdominal pain and weight loss. Upon examination, he was found to have elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), measuring approximately 300 ng/mL, which is indicative of HCC. The patient had a Child-Pugh A liver function status, suggesting that he had relatively preserved liver function despite the presence of the tumor.\n\n**Imaging Findings:**\nDiagnostic imaging techniques were employed to evaluate the liver lesion. The imaging modalities included:\n\n1. **Ultrasonography (US):** This was performed initially and showed a suspicious liver mass.\n2. **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** A contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT scan was conducted, revealing a hypervascular lesion in the liver. The imaging characteristics included:\n   - **Hyperenhancement during the arterial phase:** The lesion demonstrated significant enhancement compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma, which is a hallmark feature of hypervascular HCC.\n   - **Washout in the portal venous or delayed phases:** Following the arterial phase, the lesion exhibited washout, further supporting the diagnosis of HCC.\n\nIn this case, the CT scan findings allowed for a preoperative diagnosis of HCC to be made with a high degree of accuracy (94.33% in similar cases). The patient subsequently underwent surgical intervention, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated HCC.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis case study highlights the importance of imaging in the diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinoma. The combination of elevated AFP levels and characteristic imaging findings on CT allowed for a confident diagnosis without the need for invasive biopsy, which is often avoided in patients with chronic liver disease due to the risks involved. Imaging plays a crucial role in the detection, characterization, and staging of HCC, guiding treatment decisions and management strategies.
