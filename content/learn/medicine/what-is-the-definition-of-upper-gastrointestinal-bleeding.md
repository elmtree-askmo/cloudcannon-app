    What is the definition of upper gastrointestinal bleeding?
answer: >-
    Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is defined as bleeding that occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. It is characterized by the presence of blood in vomit (hematemesis) or in altered form as black, tarry stools (melena). The condition can arise from various underlying disorders, including peptic ulcers, esophagitis, gastritis, and esophageal varices. UGIB is a significant medical concern, as it can be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions and often requires prompt medical evaluation and intervention. \n\nThe definition of UGIB can also be framed in relation to anatomical landmarks, with bleeding being classified as upper GI bleeding if it originates from a source proximal to the ligament of Treitz, which marks the transition between the upper and lower parts of the small intestine. The incidence of UGIB is estimated to be between 80 to 150 cases per 100,000 population annually, with a mortality rate ranging from 2% to 10%.
