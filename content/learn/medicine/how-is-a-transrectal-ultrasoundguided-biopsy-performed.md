    How is a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy performed?
answer: >-
    A transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS biopsy) is a procedure used primarily to diagnose prostate cancer. Hereâ€™s how it is typically performed:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before the procedure, patients may undergo an MRI scan to help the doctor determine the best areas to target for biopsy. Patients are usually advised to avoid blood thinners and may receive instructions on bowel preparation.\n\n2. **Positioning**: The patient lies on their side or back, depending on the doctor's preference. If an MRI-guided biopsy is being performed, the patient may lie face-down on a cushioned table.\n\n3. **Ultrasound Probe Insertion**: A small ultrasound probe, about the size of a finger, is gently inserted into the rectum. This probe emits high-frequency sound waves that create sonogram images of the prostate gland.\n\n4. **Imaging Guidance**: The urologist uses the ultrasound images to visualize the prostate and identify any suspicious areas that may require sampling. The ultrasound helps ensure that the biopsy needle is accurately guided to the correct location.\n\n5. **Biopsy Needle Insertion**: A thin, hollow biopsy needle is then inserted through the rectal wall into the prostate. The doctor may take multiple samples (usually 10 to 12) from different areas of the prostate to increase the chances of detecting cancer if it is present.\n\n6. **Sample Collection**: Each time the needle is inserted, a small tissue sample is taken. The entire procedure typically lasts about 45 minutes or less.\n\n7. **Post-Procedure Care**: After the biopsy, patients may experience some discomfort, minor bleeding, or infection risk. They are usually monitored for a short period before being discharged with post-procedure care instructions.\n\nThis procedure is commonly performed in men with elevated PSA levels, abnormal findings on a digital rectal examination (DRE), or other indications of potential prostate cancer. The TRUS biopsy is a critical tool in the diagnostic process for urologic malignancies, particularly prostate cancer.
