    Pneumobilia is the presence of air in the biliary system, identified on abdominal X-ray by air bubbles and the 'saber sign'. It indicates a communication with the GI tract or infection, and is best assessed by CT or ultrasound.

    What is pneumobilia and how is it identified on an abdominal X-ray?
answer: >-
    Pneumobilia, also known as aerobilia, refers to the presence of air within the biliary system, which includes the bile ducts, gallbladder, and liver. This condition typically indicates a possible communication between the biliary system and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or it may be associated with infection by gas-forming bacteria. \n\nOn an abdominal X-ray, pneumobilia can be identified by the presence of air bubbles within the biliary tree, which usually appear as isolated bubbles ranging from 2 to 5 millimeters in size. A characteristic finding on the X-ray is the "saber sign," which describes a sword-shaped lucency in the right paraspinal region of the upper abdomen, representing gas extending from the common bile duct into the left hepatic duct. This sign is present in approximately 50% of patients with pneumobilia.\n\nWhile pneumobilia can be detected on plain abdominal X-rays, it is more commonly and accurately characterized using computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. On ultrasound, pneumobilia appears as multiple highly reflective areas in the liver, often accompanied by prominent shadowing behind these areas. \n\nIt is important to differentiate pneumobilia from portal venous gas, as they indicate different underlying pathologies. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and management.
