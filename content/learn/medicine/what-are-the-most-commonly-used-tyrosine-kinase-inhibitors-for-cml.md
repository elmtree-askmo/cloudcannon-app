    What are the most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors for CML?
answer: >-
    The most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) include:\n\n1. **Imatinib (Gleevec)**: This was the first TKI approved for CML and remains a standard first-line treatment. It targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein that is responsible for the uncontrolled growth of CML cells.\n\n2. **Dasatinib (Sprycel)**: This second-generation TKI can be used as a first-line treatment for CML, especially in patients who cannot tolerate imatinib or in cases where imatinib is ineffective. It has a broader spectrum of activity against various BCR-ABL mutations.\n\n3. **Nilotinib (Tasigna)**: Another second-generation TKI, nilotinib is also used as a first-line treatment. It is known for its potency and ability to achieve faster molecular responses compared to imatinib.\n\n4. **Bosutinib (Bosulif)**: This TKI is typically used in patients who have experienced resistance or intolerance to prior therapies. It has a unique mechanism of action and is effective against certain BCR-ABL mutations.\n\n5. **Asciminib (Scemblix)**: This is a newer TKI that specifically targets the ABL myristoyl pocket, providing an alternative for patients who have developed resistance to other TKIs.\n\nThese TKIs have transformed CML into a manageable chronic condition, allowing for improved survival rates and quality of life for patients. Each TKI has its own side effect profile and may be chosen based on individual patient circumstances, including previous treatment responses and tolerability.
