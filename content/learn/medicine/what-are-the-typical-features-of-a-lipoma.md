    What are the typical features of a lipoma?
answer: >-
    A lipoma is a common benign tumor composed of mature adipocytes (fat cells) that typically presents as a soft, painless lump located just beneath the skin in the subcutaneous tissue. Here are the typical features of a lipoma:\n\n1. **Location**: Lipomas can occur anywhere in the body where fat is present, but they are most commonly found on the upper back, shoulders, abdomen, and arms.\n\n2. **Size**: They usually range in size from 1 cm to over 10 cm, with most being less than 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) in diameter.\n\n3. **Texture and Mobility**: Lipomas are generally soft to the touch and have a doughy consistency. They are movable under the skin with slight finger pressure, which distinguishes them from other types of masses.\n\n4. **Growth Rate**: Lipomas are slow-growing tumors and typically do not cause any symptoms other than their presence. They usually stop growing after reaching a certain size.\n\n5. **Pain**: They are usually painless, although some individuals may experience discomfort if the lipoma presses on nearby structures.\n\n6. **Multiplicity**: Some individuals may develop multiple lipomas, a condition known as lipomatosis.\n\n7. **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is often made through physical examination, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be used to confirm the presence of mature adipose tissue without atypical features.\n\n8. **Benign Nature**: Lipomas are benign and do not transform into cancer. However, they can sometimes be confused with liposarcomas, which are malignant tumors.\n\nOverall, lipomas are generally harmless and do not require treatment unless they cause discomfort or other complications. In such cases, surgical removal may be considered.
