    What role does hepatic angiography play in the imaging of HCC?
answer: >-
    Hepatic angiography plays a significant role in the imaging and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While modern imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have become the primary tools for diagnosing and staging HCC, hepatic angiography remains an important technique, particularly in specific contexts.\n\n1. **Diagnosis and Confirmation**: Hepatic angiography is particularly useful for confirming the diagnosis of hepatic nodules that do not exhibit typical imaging features of HCC on CT or MRI. In such cases, the detailed images obtained from hepatic arteriography can provide critical information that aids in distinguishing HCC from other liver lesions.\n\n2. **Vascular Mapping**: One of the key contributions of hepatic angiography is its ability to provide a vascular map of the liver. This is essential for preoperative assessments, especially when planning surgical interventions or transarterial therapies. Understanding the anatomy of the arterial branches and hepatic segments is crucial for selecting appropriate treatment techniques and minimizing complications.\n\n3. **Interventional Procedures**: Hepatic angiography is integral to various interventional therapies for HCC, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This procedure involves the selective delivery of chemotherapy directly to the tumor's blood supply, which is guided by angiographic imaging. The dynamic information provided by angiography helps in assessing the tumor's vascularization, which is vital for effective treatment planning.\n\n4. **Complementary Role**: Although the role of hepatic angiography has evolved with the advent of advanced imaging techniques, it still serves as a complementary tool. It is often used in conjunction with CT and MRI to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy, particularly in complex cases where other imaging modalities may fall short.\n\nIn summary, hepatic angiography remains a valuable technique in the imaging and management of HCC, providing essential information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and interventional procedures. Its ability to visualize the vascular supply of liver tumors and assist in targeted therapies underscores its continued relevance in the clinical setting.
