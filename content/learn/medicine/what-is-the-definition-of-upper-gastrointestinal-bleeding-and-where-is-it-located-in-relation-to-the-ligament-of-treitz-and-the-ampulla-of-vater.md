    Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) refers to blood loss from the upper GI tract, specifically above the ligament of Treitz, affecting the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The ligament of Treitz is a key anatomical landmark distinguishing upper from lower GI bleeding.

answer: >-
    Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is defined as the loss of blood from the upper gastrointestinal tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It specifically refers to any form of bleeding that originates from a source proximal to the ligament of Treitz, which is located at the duodenojejunal junction. \n\nIn relation to the anatomical landmarks:\n- The **ligament of Treitz** marks the transition between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, serving as a critical reference point. \n- The **Ampulla of Vater**, where the bile duct and pancreatic duct empty into the duodenum, is located distal to the ligament of Treitz.\n\nThus, UGIB is characterized by bleeding that occurs above the ligament of Treitz, while bleeding that occurs below this ligament is classified as lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Common causes of UGIB include peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, and erosive gastritis, among others. Symptoms may manifest as hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (black, tarry stools), or hematochezia (bright red blood in stools).
