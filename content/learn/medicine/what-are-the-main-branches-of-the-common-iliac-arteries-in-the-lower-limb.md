    What are the main branches of the common iliac arteries in the lower limb?
answer: >-
    The common iliac arteries are the terminal branches of the abdominal aorta and play a crucial role in supplying blood to the lower limbs and pelvis. Each common iliac artery bifurcates into two main branches:\n\n1. **Internal Iliac Artery**: This artery primarily supplies blood to the pelvic organs, gluteal region, and medial thigh. It gives rise to several branches that supply the bladder, rectum, reproductive organs, and muscles in the pelvic area.\n\n2. **External Iliac Artery**: This artery continues into the thigh as the common femoral artery. It is responsible for supplying blood to the lower limb. The external iliac artery branches into the inferior epigastric artery and the deep circumflex iliac artery before it transitions into the common femoral artery at the inguinal ligament.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy and branches of the common iliac arteries is essential for diagnosing and treating various arterial diseases affecting the lower limbs.
