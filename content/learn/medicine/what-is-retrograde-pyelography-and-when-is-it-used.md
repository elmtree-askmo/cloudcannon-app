    Retrograde pyelography is a radiological procedure used to visualize the upper urinary tract, including the kidneys and ureters, through the injection of a contrast agent. It is used to diagnose obstructions, kidney stones, hematuria, urinary tract injuries, and to evaluate catheter or stent placements.

    What is retrograde pyelography and when is it used?
answer: >-
    Retrograde pyelography is a radiological procedure used to visualize the upper urinary tract, specifically the ureters and kidneys. This technique involves the injection of a contrast agent (a special dye) into the ureters through a small catheter, which is inserted during a cystoscopyâ€”a procedure where a scope is placed through the urethra into the bladder.\n\nThe primary indications for retrograde pyelography include:\n\n1. **Obstruction**: It is often used in patients suspected of having obstructions in the urinary tract, such as tumors, stones, blood clots, or strictures (narrowing) in the kidneys or ureters.\n2. **Nephrolithiasis**: It can help identify kidney stones and assess their location and size.\n3. **Hematuria**: The procedure may be indicated in cases of blood in the urine to evaluate potential sources of bleeding.\n4. **Urinary Tract Injury**: It can be used to assess injuries to the upper urinary tract.\n5. **Catheter or Stent Placement**: Retrograde pyelography is also useful for evaluating the placement of ureteral stents or catheters.\n\nThe procedure is generally quick and relatively painless, providing detailed images that can assist healthcare providers in diagnosing and planning further treatment for urinary tract abnormalities. It is considered an alternative to intravenous urography or abdominal CT scans, particularly when there are contraindications for iodinated contrast medium.
