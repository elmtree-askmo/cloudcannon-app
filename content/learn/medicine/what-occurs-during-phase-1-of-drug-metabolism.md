    What occurs during Phase 1 of drug metabolism?
answer: >-
    During Phase I of drug metabolism, the primary focus is on the biotransformation of drugs and other xenobiotics to make them more water-soluble and easier to eliminate from the body. This phase typically involves the introduction or exposure of polar functional groups on the drug molecules, which can include processes such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis.\n\nThe most common reactions in Phase I metabolism are oxidative reactions, predominantly carried out by enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family (CYP). These enzymes facilitate the conversion of the parent drug into more polar metabolites by adding functional groups such as -OH (hydroxyl), -NH2 (amino), or -SH (sulfhydryl). This modification often results in a loss of pharmacological activity, although some metabolites may retain activity or even possess different pharmacological effects compared to the parent compound.\n\nPhase I reactions are crucial as they can also prepare the drug for subsequent Phase II metabolism, where further modifications occur, typically leading to the formation of conjugates that are more readily excreted from the body. Overall, Phase I metabolism plays a significant role in determining the pharmacokinetics of drugs, influencing their efficacy and safety profiles.
