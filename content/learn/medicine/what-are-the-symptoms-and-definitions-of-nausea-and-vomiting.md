    What are the symptoms and definitions of nausea and vomiting?
answer: >-
    Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can arise from a variety of underlying conditions. \n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Nausea** is defined as the sensation that the stomach wants to empty itself, often described as an urge to vomit. It is a subjective feeling and can be quite distressing.\n- **Vomiting** (or emesis) is the act of forcibly emptying the contents of the stomach through the mouth. This can occur with or without the presence of food in the stomach. The term "dry heaving" refers to retching, which is the act of attempting to vomit without expelling any stomach contents, often resulting in the release of small amounts of clear secretions.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Nausea may be accompanied by other symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, and increased salivation.\n- Vomiting can lead to additional symptoms like abdominal pain, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances, especially if it is persistent.\n\n**Causes:**\nNausea and vomiting can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including:\n- **Gastrointestinal conditions**: Such as viral gastroenteritis (often referred to as stomach flu), food poisoning, peptic ulcers, gastritis, and gastroparesis.\n- **Pregnancy**: Particularly in the form of morning sickness during the first trimester.\n- **Medications**: Certain drugs, including chemotherapy agents and substances like marijuana, can induce nausea and vomiting.\n- **Other medical conditions**: Such as migraines, concussions, and motion sickness.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if nausea or vomiting persists for more than a week, as this may indicate a more serious underlying condition.
