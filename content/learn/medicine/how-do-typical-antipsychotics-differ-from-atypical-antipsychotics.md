    How do typical antipsychotics differ from atypical antipsychotics?
answer: >-
    Typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics are two distinct classes of medications used primarily to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The main differences between these two classes lie in their mechanisms of action, side effects, and overall efficacy.\n\n1. **Mechanism of Action**:\n   - **Typical Antipsychotics**: These are often referred to as first-generation antipsychotics. They primarily function as dopamine receptor antagonists, meaning they block dopamine receptors in the brain. This action is effective in reducing symptoms of psychosis but is also associated with a higher risk of movement disorders.\n   - **Atypical Antipsychotics**: Known as second-generation antipsychotics, these medications have a broader mechanism of action. They not only block dopamine receptors but also affect serotonin receptors. This dual action is believed to contribute to their efficacy in treating a wider range of symptoms, including both positive symptoms (like hallucinations) and negative symptoms (like apathy).\n\n2. **Side Effects**:\n   - **Typical Antipsychotics**: These medications are associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which include movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, tremors, and rigidity. Other common side effects include sedation, dry mouth, and weight gain.\n   - **Atypical Antipsychotics**: While atypical antipsychotics generally have a lower risk of causing movement disorders compared to typical antipsychotics, they can still lead to side effects such as weight gain and metabolic syndrome. Some atypical antipsychotics may cause mild extrapyramidal symptoms, but these are less common.\n\n3. **Efficacy**:\n   - Atypical antipsychotics are often considered to have clinical advantages over typical antipsychotics, particularly in treatment-resistant cases. For example, clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, has shown effectiveness in patients who do not respond to other treatments.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **Typical Antipsychotics**: Common examples include haloperidol and chlorpromazine.\n   - **Atypical Antipsychotics**: Examples include risperidone and clozapine.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between typical and atypical antipsychotics lies in their mechanisms of action, with typical antipsychotics mainly targeting dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics affecting both dopamine and serotonin receptors. This difference contributes to variations in their side effect profiles and overall treatment efficacy.
