    How is endoscopy utilized in the diagnosis of thyroid conditions?
answer: >-
    Endoscopy, particularly upper endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), is utilized in the diagnosis of thyroid conditions by providing a close view of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures. EUS can visualize thyroid lesions, which is particularly useful for identifying malignancies. In a study, EUS successfully visualized three previously undiagnosed thyroid cancers, including two primary papillary thyroid cancers and one anaplastic thyroid cancer. This demonstrates the potential of EUS in detecting thyroid conditions that may not be apparent through other diagnostic methods.\n\nDuring an EUS examination, the thyroid can be visualized at a distance of 18 to 20 cm from the incisors, allowing for the assessment of thyroid lesions, especially those located in the inferior portion of the thyroid gland. Additionally, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be performed to obtain tissue samples from these lesions, aiding in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules and potential cancers.\n\nWhile endoscopy is not the primary method for diagnosing thyroid conditions—ultrasound and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone measurements are more commonly used—it serves as a valuable tool in specific cases, particularly when other imaging techniques may not provide sufficient information. Overall, endoscopy enhances the diagnostic capabilities for thyroid conditions, especially in complex cases where malignancy is suspected.
