    What are the common benign causes of biliary tree conditions?
answer: >-
    Common benign causes of biliary tree conditions primarily include:\n\n1. **Iatrogenic Causes**: These are the most prevalent causes of benign biliary strictures, accounting for up to 80% of cases. They often result from surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Post-surgical complications can lead to biliary injuries or anastomotic strictures.\n\n2. **Chronic Pancreatitis**: This condition can lead to inflammation and scarring of the biliary tree, resulting in strictures.\n\n3. **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)**: PSC is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, leading to strictures and potential complications.\n\n4. **Autoimmune Diseases**: Conditions such as autoimmune pancreatitis and autoimmune cholangitis can affect the biliary tree, causing strictures due to inflammation.\n\n5. **Mirizzi Syndrome**: This syndrome occurs when a gallstone becomes lodged in the cystic duct, leading to compression of the common bile duct and resulting in a stricture.\n\n6. **Ischemic Cholangiopathy**: This condition arises from reduced blood flow to the bile ducts, which can lead to strictures.\n\n7. **Recurrent Pyogenic Cholangitis**: This is a chronic infection of the bile ducts that can lead to strictures over time.\n\n8. **Congenital Conditions**: Various congenital disorders, such as bile duct cysts or choledochal cysts, can also lead to benign biliary conditions.\n\n9. **Benign Tumors**: Benign lesions such as bile duct hamartomas, adenomas, biliary papillomatosis, and cystadenomas can cause obstruction and lead to biliary strictures.\n\nThese conditions highlight the diverse etiologies of benign biliary tree disorders, which can vary significantly in their prognosis and treatment approaches. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing these conditions and guiding treatment planning.
