    How does palliative surgery differ from curative surgery in cancer management?
answer: >-
    Palliative surgery and curative surgery serve distinct roles in cancer management, primarily differentiated by their goals and intended outcomes.\n\n**Curative Surgery** is performed with the primary aim of removing cancerous tumors or affected tissues to eradicate the disease. This type of surgery is often part of a broader treatment plan that may include chemotherapy, radiation, or other interventions aimed at completely resolving the cancer. For instance, a surgeon may remove a tumor along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that all cancer cells are eliminated, thereby increasing the chances of a complete cure.\n\n**Palliative Surgery**, on the other hand, is focused on improving the quality of life for patients who may not be candidates for curative treatment due to advanced disease or other health complications. The primary goal of palliative surgery is to relieve symptoms, alleviate pain, and address complications caused by the cancer, rather than to cure the disease. For example, a palliative surgical procedure might involve removing a blockage in the intestines caused by a tumor, which can help relieve pain and improve the patient's ability to eat and digest food.\n\nIn summary, while curative surgery aims to eliminate cancer and potentially cure the patient, palliative surgery is concerned with symptom relief and enhancing the quality of life for patients facing advanced cancer. Both approaches are essential in the comprehensive management of cancer, addressing the diverse needs of patients at different stages of their illness.
