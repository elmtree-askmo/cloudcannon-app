    What is the role of the internal and external iliac arteries in the pelvic arterial system?
answer: >-
    The internal and external iliac arteries play crucial roles in the pelvic arterial system, each serving distinct functions and supplying different regions of the body.\n\n1. **Internal Iliac Artery**: The internal iliac artery (IIA), also known as the hypogastric artery, is primarily responsible for supplying blood to the pelvic viscera, which includes the bladder, rectum, and reproductive organs. It also provides blood to the pelvic wall, perineum, gluteal region, and the medial part of the thigh. The internal iliac artery branches extensively within the pelvis, giving rise to several important arteries that supply these areas. It arises from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery at the pelvic brim.\n\n2. **External Iliac Artery**: The external iliac artery is the largest branch of the common iliac artery and serves as the main blood supply to the lower limb. It runs along the pelvic brim and continues into the thigh, where it becomes the femoral artery. Although the external iliac artery does not directly supply the pelvic organs, it gives rise to branches such as the inferior epigastric artery and the deep circumflex iliac artery, which supply surrounding muscles and tissues.\n\nIn summary, the internal iliac artery is essential for perfusing the pelvic organs and surrounding structures, while the external iliac artery is critical for supplying blood to the lower extremities. Together, they ensure adequate blood flow to both the pelvic region and the lower limbs.
