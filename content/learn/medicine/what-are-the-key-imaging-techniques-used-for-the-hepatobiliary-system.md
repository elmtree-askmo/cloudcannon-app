    What are the key imaging techniques used for the hepatobiliary system?
answer: >-
    The key imaging techniques used for the hepatobiliary system include:\n\n1. **Ultrasonography (US)**: This is often the first-line imaging modality due to its safety (non-ionizing radiation), cost-effectiveness, and high sensitivity for detecting biliary tract abnormalities, particularly gallstones. It provides excellent visualization of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts and can be performed at the bedside.\n\n2. **Computed Tomography (CT)**: CT scans offer detailed cross-sectional images of the hepatobiliary system. They are particularly useful for evaluating liver lesions, bile duct obstructions, and assessing the vascular anatomy. The use of large-bolus intravenous iodinated contrast media during dynamic CT examinations enhances the evaluation of the hepatobiliary ductal system and blood flow.\n\n3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: MRI is valuable for its ability to provide high-resolution images of the liver and biliary system without ionizing radiation. It is particularly useful for characterizing liver lesions and evaluating biliary tract diseases. MRI cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive technique that visualizes the biliary and pancreatic ducts.\n\n4. **Nuclear Medicine Imaging**: Techniques such as hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) utilize radioactive tracers to assess liver function and visualize the biliary system. This method is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions like acute cholecystitis and biliary obstruction.\n\n5. **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: This is an invasive procedure that combines endoscopy and fluoroscopy to visualize the biliary and pancreatic ducts. It is often used for therapeutic interventions, such as removing bile duct stones or placing stents.\n\nEach of these imaging modalities has its specific indications and advantages, and often a combination of these techniques is employed to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the hepatobiliary system.
