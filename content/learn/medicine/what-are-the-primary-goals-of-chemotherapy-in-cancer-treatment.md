    What are the primary goals of chemotherapy in cancer treatment?
answer: >-
    The primary goals of chemotherapy in cancer treatment include:\n\n1. **Cure**: In some cases, chemotherapy aims to completely eradicate cancer from the body. This is often the goal for localized cancers that are highly responsive to chemotherapy agents.\n\n2. **Control**: For cancers that cannot be cured, chemotherapy may be used to control the growth and spread of cancer cells. This involves slowing down the progression of the disease and prolonging the patient's life.\n\n3. **Palliation**: Chemotherapy can also be used to relieve symptoms caused by cancer, improving the quality of life for patients. This is particularly important in advanced stages of cancer where the focus shifts from curative treatment to comfort and symptom management.\n\n4. **Adjuvant Therapy**: Chemotherapy may be administered after surgery to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. This is known as adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n5. **Neoadjuvant Therapy**: In some cases, chemotherapy is given before surgery to shrink tumors, making them easier to remove. This is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n6. **Combination with Other Treatments**: Chemotherapy is often used in conjunction with other treatment modalities, such as radiation therapy and surgery, to enhance overall treatment effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the specific goals of chemotherapy can vary based on the type of cancer, its stage, and the individual patient's health status and treatment preferences.
