    How do Type II hypersensitivity reactions occur?
answer: >-
    Type II hypersensitivity reactions, also known as cytotoxic reactions, occur when antibodies (primarily IgG or IgM) bind to specific antigens present on the surface of cells or extracellular matrix components. This binding leads to the destruction of the targeted cells through various mechanisms. The process can be divided into two main phases: the sensitization phase and the effector phase.\n\n1. **Sensitization Phase**: In this initial phase, the immune system produces antibodies that recognize and bind to specific antigens on the surface of cells. These antigens can be intrinsic to the cells or may be introduced by external factors, such as drugs or infections.\n\n2. **Effector Phase**: During this phase, the target cells become coated with the antibodies. This coating can trigger several destructive mechanisms, including:\n   - **Complement Activation**: The binding of antibodies can activate the complement system, leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex that causes lysis of the target cell.\n   - **Phagocytosis**: Antibody-coated cells can be recognized and engulfed by phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, leading to cellular destruction.\n   - **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: Natural killer (NK) cells can recognize and kill antibody-coated target cells.\n\nType II hypersensitivity reactions are typically localized rather than systemic, although they can affect the entire body if the target antigens are present on mobile cells, such as erythrocytes or leukocytes. Common examples of Type II hypersensitivity include blood transfusion reactions, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and certain drug-induced immune reactions. Symptoms usually manifest within hours after exposure to the antigen in a sensitized individual. \n\nIn summary, Type II hypersensitivity reactions involve the direct binding of antibodies to cell surface antigens, leading to cellular damage through various immune mechanisms.
