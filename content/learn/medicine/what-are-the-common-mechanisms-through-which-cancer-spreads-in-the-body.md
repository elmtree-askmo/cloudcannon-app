    What are the common mechanisms through which cancer spreads in the body?
answer: >-
    Cancer spreads in the body primarily through two mechanisms: the bloodstream and the lymphatic system. This process is known as metastasis, where cancer cells break away from the original tumor, travel through these systems, and establish new tumors in distant organs.\n\n1. **Bloodstream**: Cancer cells can invade blood vessels, allowing them to circulate throughout the body. Once in the bloodstream, they can reach various organs and tissues, where they may form secondary tumors. For example, melanoma cells can migrate to lymph nodes and then spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs.\n\n2. **Lymphatic System**: Similar to blood vessels, lymphatic vessels transport a clear fluid that contains immune cells. Cancer cells can enter the lymphatic system and travel to nearby lymph nodes. From there, they can disseminate to other regions of the body.\n\nThe process of metastasis involves several steps:\n- **Local Tumor Cell Invasion**: Cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and enter either the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels.\n- **Circulation**: Once in the bloodstream or lymphatic system, cancer cells can travel to distant sites.\n- **Extravasation**: Cancer cells exit the circulation and invade new tissues.\n- **Colonization**: Finally, cancer cells must adapt to their new environment and grow into new tumors.\n\nMetastasis is a complex process that often involves the evasion of host defenses, such as the immune system and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding these mechanisms is crucial, as metastatic cancer is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths, with over 90% of cancer fatalities resulting from metastatic disease. \n\nResearch continues to explore the biological underpinnings of metastasis, aiming to develop therapeutic approaches to prevent or inhibit this process.
