answer: >-
    The typical duration of human gestation is approximately 40 weeks, which is generally calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). This period can vary, with normal pregnancies ranging from 37 weeks to 42 weeks. Specifically, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) defines the following stages:\n\n- **Preterm**: Births occurring between 20 weeks and 37 weeks.\n- **Early term**: Births occurring between 37 weeks and 38 weeks 6 days.\n- **Full term**: Births occurring between 39 weeks and 40 weeks 6 days.\n- **Late term**: Births occurring between 41 weeks and 41 weeks 6 days.\n- **Postterm**: Births occurring at 42 weeks and beyond.\n\nOn average, the gestation period is about 266 to 270 days from ovulation to childbirth, with a median length of approximately 268 days (or 38 weeks and 2 days). It is important to note that while 40 weeks is the standard reference, individual pregnancies can vary significantly due to various factors, including maternal health and prenatal care.
