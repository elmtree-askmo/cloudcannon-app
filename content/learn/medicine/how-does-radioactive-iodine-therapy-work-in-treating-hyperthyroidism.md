    How does radioactive iodine therapy work in treating hyperthyroidism?
answer: >-
    Radioactive iodine therapy, specifically using iodine-131 (I-131), is a well-established treatment for hyperthyroidism, particularly in cases caused by Graves' disease or overactive thyroid nodules. The mechanism of action relies on the thyroid gland's natural ability to absorb iodine, which is essential for the production of thyroid hormones.\n\nWhen a patient receives radioactive iodine therapy, they typically ingest a single dose of I-131. This radioactive isotope is selectively taken up by the thyroid cells, similar to how non-radioactive iodine is absorbed. Once inside the thyroid gland, the emitted radiation from I-131 primarily targets and destroys the overactive thyroid tissue. This process effectively reduces the production of thyroid hormones, thereby alleviating the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nThe treatment is generally safe and effective, with cure rates ranging from 80% to 100%. However, some patients may require additional doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. It is important to note that while radioactive iodine therapy is effective in treating hyperthyroidism, it can lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) in some patients, necessitating lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn summary, radioactive iodine therapy works by exploiting the thyroid gland's affinity for iodine, delivering targeted radiation to reduce thyroid activity and restore hormonal balance. This non-invasive treatment option is widely used and has been favored by many endocrinologists for managing hyperthyroidism.
