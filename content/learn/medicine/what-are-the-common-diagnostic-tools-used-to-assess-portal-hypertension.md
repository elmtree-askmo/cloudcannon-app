    What are the common diagnostic tools used to assess portal hypertension?
answer: >-
    Common diagnostic tools used to assess portal hypertension include a combination of non-invasive and invasive methods. Here are the key diagnostic approaches:\n\n1. **Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)**:\n   - **Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM)**: This method uses elastography to assess liver stiffness, which correlates with portal pressure. It is a reliable predictor of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and related complications.\n   - **Spleen Stiffness Measurement (SSM)**: Similar to LSM, SSM can provide valuable information regarding portal hypertension and its severity.\n   - **Imaging Studies**: \n     - **Doppler Ultrasonography**: This is often the first-line imaging technique used to evaluate blood flow in the portal vein and assess for signs of portal hypertension.\n     - **Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: These imaging modalities can help visualize the liver and portal system, identifying complications such as varices or ascites.\n\n2. **Invasive Methods**:\n   - **Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) Measurement**: This is considered the gold standard for diagnosing portal hypertension. It involves inserting a catheter into the hepatic veins to measure the pressure gradient, with a value of â‰¥10 mm Hg indicating clinically significant portal hypertension.\n   - **Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)**: This procedure is used to directly visualize the esophagus and stomach for the presence of varices, which are a common complication of portal hypertension.\n\n3. **Clinical Assessment**: The diagnosis can also be supported by clinical signs and symptoms, such as the presence of ascites or varices, along with a thorough physical examination.\n\nOverall, while non-invasive methods are increasingly favored for their safety and ease of use, invasive techniques remain crucial for definitive diagnosis and management of portal hypertension.
