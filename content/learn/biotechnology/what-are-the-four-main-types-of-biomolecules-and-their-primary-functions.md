    What are the four main types of biomolecules and their primary functions?
answer: >-
    The four main types of biomolecules essential for life are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Each of these biomolecules has distinct structures and functions that are critical for biological processes in living organisms.\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**:\n   - **Structure**: Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1 (e.g., glucose, C₆H₁₂O₆).\n   - **Function**: Primarily serve as energy sources (e.g., glucose for cellular respiration) and structural components (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls). They can be classified into:\n     - **Monosaccharides**: Simple sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose).\n     - **Disaccharides**: Composed of two monosaccharides (e.g., sucrose, lactose).\n     - **Polysaccharides**: Long chains of monosaccharides (e.g., starch, glycogen).\n\n2. **Lipids**:\n   - **Structure**: Composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, lipids are hydrophobic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, and steroids.\n   - **Function**: Serve as energy storage (e.g., triglycerides), structural components of cell membranes (e.g., phospholipids), and signaling molecules (e.g., steroid hormones). They are crucial for maintaining the integrity of cell membranes and providing insulation and protection.\n\n3. **Proteins**:\n   - **Structure**: Made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, proteins have complex structures that can be categorized into primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels.\n   - **Function**: Perform a wide range of functions including catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes), providing structural support (e.g., collagen), transporting molecules (e.g., hemoglobin), and regulating biological processes (e.g., hormones). Proteins are essential for cellular structure and function.\n\n4. **Nucleic Acids**:\n   - **Structure**: Composed of nucleotides, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The two main types are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n   - **Function**: Involved in the storage and transfer of genetic information. DNA carries the genetic blueprint for the development and functioning of living organisms, while RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and gene expression.\n\nThese biomolecules are fundamental to the structure and function of cells, and they participate in various biochemical processes that sustain life.
