    How are X-linked recessive diseases inherited and what are some examples?
answer: >-
    X-linked recessive diseases are inherited through mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. This mode of inheritance results in the phenotype being expressed in males, who have only one X chromosome (hemizygous), and in females only if they are homozygous for the mutated gene (having two copies of the mutated gene). \n\nIn males, the presence of a single mutated gene on the X chromosome will lead to the expression of the disease, while females, who have two X chromosomes, typically require two copies of the mutated gene to express the disease phenotype. As a result, females can often be carriers of X-linked recessive conditions without showing symptoms themselves, although skewed X-inactivation can sometimes lead to mild expression of the disease in carriers.\n\nSome common examples of X-linked recessive diseases include:\n\n1. **Red-green color blindness**: This condition affects an individual's ability to distinguish between red and green hues.\n2. **Hemophilia A**: A blood clotting disorder that leads to excessive bleeding due to a deficiency in clotting factor VIII.\n3. **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**: A severe form of muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration.\n4. **X-linked agammaglobulinemia**: A condition that results in a deficiency of antibodies, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.\n5. **Lesch-Nyhan syndrome**: A disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), leading to neurological and behavioral abnormalities.\n\nIn summary, X-linked recessive diseases predominantly affect males, while females can be carriers and may exhibit mild symptoms in rare cases. The inheritance pattern is such that affected fathers cannot pass the condition to their sons, as sons inherit the Y chromosome from their fathers.
