    Can you summarize the overall functions of biomolecules in living organisms?
answer: >-
    Biomolecules are essential organic compounds that play a critical role in the structure and function of living organisms. They can be classified into four major categories: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Each type of biomolecule has unique functions that contribute to the overall maintenance and metabolic processes of life.\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**: These biomolecules are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They serve as essential energy sources for living organisms and are also important structural components of cells. Carbohydrates can be simple sugars (monosaccharides) or complex forms (polysaccharides), and they are among the most abundant biomolecules on Earth.\n\n2. **Proteins**: Composed of amino acids, proteins are crucial for numerous biological functions. They act as enzymes, facilitating biochemical reactions, and serve as structural components of cells and tissues. Additionally, proteins play roles in transport, signaling, and immune defense, with antibodies being a prime example of proteins that provide immune protection.\n\n3. **Lipids**: These hydrophobic molecules are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. Lipids are vital for forming cell membranes, storing energy, and serving as signaling molecules. They include fats, oils, and phospholipids, which are essential for maintaining cellular integrity and function.\n\n4. **Nucleic Acids**: The two primary types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA carries the genetic blueprint of an organism, while RNA is involved in protein synthesis and gene expression. Nucleic acids are fundamental for storing and transmitting genetic information, which is crucial for growth, reproduction, and the overall functioning of living organisms.\n\nIn summary, biomolecules are the building blocks of life, involved in energy storage, structural integrity, biochemical reactions, genetic information storage, and regulation of biological processes. Their diverse structures and functions are essential for the growth, maintenance, and reproduction of all living organisms.
