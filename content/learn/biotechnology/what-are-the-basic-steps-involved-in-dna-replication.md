    What are the basic steps involved in DNA replication?
answer: >-
    DNA replication is a crucial biological process that ensures the accurate copying of a cell's DNA before cell division. The basic steps involved in DNA replication can be summarized as follows:\n\n### 1. Formation of the Replication Fork\nThe process begins at specific locations on the DNA molecule known as origins of replication. Here, the double helix is unwound by the enzyme **DNA helicase**, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, resulting in the formation of a replication fork. This creates two single-stranded DNA templates.\n\n### 2. Initiation\nOnce the DNA strands are separated, **DNA primase** synthesizes a short RNA primer on each template strand. This primer provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. The enzyme **DNA polymerase III** then binds to the primer and begins adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand, following the base pairing rules (A pairs with T, and C pairs with G).\n\n### 3. Elongation\nDuring elongation, DNA polymerase III synthesizes the new DNA strand by adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. The replication fork is bi-directional, meaning that one strand (the leading strand) is synthesized continuously towards the fork, while the other strand (the lagging strand) is synthesized in short segments known as **Okazaki fragments**. Each Okazaki fragment requires a new RNA primer for initiation.\n\n### 4. Termination\nOnce the entire DNA molecule has been replicated, the RNA primers are removed by **DNA polymerase I**, which replaces them with DNA nucleotides. Finally, **DNA ligase** connects the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, sealing the sugar-phosphate backbone to create a continuous DNA strand. The result is two identical DNA molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.\n\n### Summary of Key Enzymes Involved:\n- **DNA helicase**: Unwinds the DNA double helix.\n- **DNA primase**: Synthesizes RNA primers.\n- **DNA polymerase III**: Adds nucleotides to form the new DNA strand.\n- **DNA polymerase I**: Replaces RNA primers with DNA.\n- **DNA ligase**: Joins Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.\n\nThis process is essential for cell division and ensures that genetic information is accurately passed on to daughter cells.
