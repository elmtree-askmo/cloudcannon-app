    Nucleotides are the fundamental building blocks of DNA and RNA, consisting of a nitrogenous base, sugar, and phosphate. In DNA, nucleotides pair specifically: adenine with thymine, and cytosine with guanine, forming the double helix structure essential for genetic replication.

    What are nucleotides and how do they pair in DNA?
answer: >-
    Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. In the case of DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose, and the four nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\n\nIn DNA, nucleotides pair in a specific manner known as complementary base pairing. This means that adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This pairing occurs through hydrogen bonds: A and T form two hydrogen bonds, while C and G form three hydrogen bonds. This specific pairing is crucial for the stability of the DNA double helix structure and ensures accurate replication of genetic information.\n\nThe arrangement of these base pairs contributes to the overall structure of DNA, which is a double-stranded helix. The two strands run in opposite directions, or antiparallel, with the sugar-phosphate backbone forming the outer structure and the nitrogenous bases stacked in the interior, resembling the rungs of a ladder. This organization allows for the precise copying of DNA during replication, as each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. \n\nChargaff's rules further emphasize the pairing: the amount of adenine in a DNA molecule is equal to the amount of thymine, and the amount of guanine is equal to the amount of cytosine. This fundamental principle of base pairing is essential for the integrity and function of genetic material.
