    What are exergonic and endergonic reactions and their roles in metabolism?
answer: >-
    Exergonic and endergonic reactions are fundamental concepts in biochemistry that describe the energy changes associated with chemical reactions, particularly in the context of metabolism.\n\n### Exergonic Reactions\nAn **exergonic reaction** is characterized by a net release of free energy, which means that the Gibbs free energy change (Î”G) for the reaction is negative ($\Delta G < 0$). These reactions are often spontaneous, meaning they can occur without the input of additional energy. A classic example of an exergonic reaction is the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP):\n\n$$\n\text{ATP} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i \quad (\Delta G \approx -7.3 \text{ kcal/mol})\n$$\n\nIn metabolic pathways, exergonic reactions play a crucial role by providing the energy necessary for various cellular processes, such as cellular respiration, where glucose is broken down to release energy.\n\n### Endergonic Reactions\nIn contrast, an **endergonic reaction** requires an input of energy, resulting in a positive Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G > 0$). These reactions are non-spontaneous, meaning they cannot occur without the addition of energy. Endergonic reactions are often involved in anabolic processes, where smaller molecules are synthesized into larger, more complex molecules. For example, the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water during photosynthesis is an endergonic process.\n\n### Coupling of Reactions\nIn biological systems, exergonic and endergonic reactions are often coupled. The energy released from exergonic reactions can be harnessed to drive endergonic reactions. This coupling is essential for maintaining the energy balance within cells and facilitating processes such as protein synthesis and muscle contraction.\n\n### Summary\n- **Exergonic Reactions**: Release energy, spontaneous, $\Delta G < 0$ (e.g., ATP hydrolysis).\n- **Endergonic Reactions**: Absorb energy, non-spontaneous, $\Delta G > 0$ (e.g., protein synthesis).\n- **Metabolic Role**: Exergonic reactions provide energy for cellular functions, while endergonic reactions utilize that energy for biosynthesis and other energy-requiring processes.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for comprehending how cells manage energy and carry out the myriad of biochemical reactions necessary for life.
