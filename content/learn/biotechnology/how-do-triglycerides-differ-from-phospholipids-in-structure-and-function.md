    How do triglycerides differ from phospholipids in structure and function?
answer: >-
    Triglycerides and phospholipids are both types of lipids, but they differ significantly in their structure and function.\n\n### Structure\n\n1. **Triglycerides**:\n   - Composed of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids.\n   - The glycerol backbone is a three-carbon alcohol, and each of the three carbon atoms is esterified to a fatty acid through dehydration synthesis.\n   - The fatty acids can be saturated (no double bonds) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds), affecting the physical properties of the triglyceride (e.g., whether it is solid or liquid at room temperature).\n\n2. **Phospholipids**:\n   - Composed of a glycerol backbone, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group.\n   - The two fatty acids are hydrophobic (water-repelling), while the phosphate group is hydrophilic (water-attracting), making phospholipids amphipathic.\n   - This unique structure allows phospholipids to form bilayers in aqueous environments, with the hydrophilic heads facing outward and the hydrophobic tails sequestered inward.\n\n### Function\n\n1. **Triglycerides**:\n   - Primarily serve as long-term energy storage molecules. They provide more than double the energy per gram compared to carbohydrates.\n   - They also play roles in insulation and protection of organs, acting as a cushion against physical shocks.\n\n2. **Phospholipids**:\n   - Essential for forming biological membranes, such as the cell membrane. Their amphipathic nature allows them to self-assemble into lipid bilayers, creating a barrier that separates the interior of the cell from the external environment.\n   - They facilitate selective permeability, allowing certain substances to pass while keeping others out, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, triglycerides are primarily energy storage molecules with a structure consisting of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone, while phospholipids are key components of cell membranes, characterized by their amphipathic nature due to the presence of two fatty acids and a phosphate group. This structural difference underlies their distinct functions in biological systems.
