    How do eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells?
answer: >-
    Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in several fundamental ways, primarily related to their structure and organization. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Nucleus**: The most significant distinction is that eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus that contains their genetic material (DNA). In contrast, prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus; instead, their DNA is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not membrane-bound.\n\n2. **Organelles**: Eukaryotic cells contain various membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and, in plant cells, chloroplasts. These organelles allow for compartmentalization of cellular functions, making eukaryotic cells more complex. Prokaryotic cells lack these organelles and have a simpler structure.\n\n3. **Size**: Eukaryotic cells are generally larger than prokaryotic cells. While prokaryotic cells typically range from 0.1 to 5.0 micrometers in diameter, eukaryotic cells can be 10 to 100 micrometers or more.\n\n4. **Cell Wall Composition**: Many prokaryotic cells have a rigid cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, while eukaryotic cells may have cell walls made of cellulose (in plants) or chitin (in fungi). Animal cells, however, do not have a cell wall.\n\n5. **Ribosomes**: The ribosomes in prokaryotic cells are smaller (70S) compared to those in eukaryotic cells (80S). This difference in ribosome size is significant for the development of antibiotics that target bacterial ribosomes without affecting eukaryotic ribosomes.\n\n6. **Reproduction**: Prokaryotic cells reproduce asexually through binary fission, a simpler process than the mitosis and meiosis seen in eukaryotic cells, which allows for more complex forms of reproduction and genetic variation.\n\n7. **Genetic Material**: In prokaryotes, the genetic material is typically circular and not associated with histones, while in eukaryotes, the DNA is linear and associated with histones, forming a more complex structure known as chromatin.\n\nThese differences highlight the complexity and diversity of life forms, with eukaryotic cells being more advanced in terms of cellular organization and function compared to prokaryotic cells.
