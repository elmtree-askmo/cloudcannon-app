    Sanger sequencing, also known as dideoxy sequencing or the chain termination method, is a widely used technique for determining the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Developed in 1977 by Frederick Sanger and his colleagues, it was the first DNA sequencing method and is still valued for its accuracy and ability to produce relatively long reads, typically over 500 nucleotides.\n\n### Principle of Sanger Sequencing\nThe core principle of Sanger sequencing is based on the incorporation of dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) during DNA synthesis. Unlike regular deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), ddNTPs lack a 3' hydroxyl group, which is essential for forming a phosphodiester bond that extends the DNA strand. When a ddNTP is incorporated into a growing DNA strand, it terminates further elongation, resulting in a series of DNA fragments of varying lengths that end at each occurrence of a specific base.\n\n### Steps Involved in Sanger Sequencing\nThe Sanger sequencing process can be broken down into several key steps:\n\n1. **Preparation of Reaction Mixtures**: Four separate reaction mixtures are prepared, each containing:\n   - A single-stranded DNA template (the DNA to be sequenced).\n   - A primer that is complementary to the template.\n   - DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the new DNA strand.\n   - The four standard dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP).\n   - A specific ddNTP (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP) for each reaction mixture.\n\n2. **Chain Termination PCR**: The reaction mixtures undergo a process similar to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), where the DNA polymerase incorporates dNTPs and ddNTPs into the growing DNA strand. The incorporation of ddNTPs leads to the termination of the strand at various lengths.\n\n3. **Gel Electrophoresis**: The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by size using gel electrophoresis. This allows for the visualization of the different lengths of DNA fragments, which correspond to the positions of the ddNTPs.\n\n4. **Sequence Reading**: The fragments are analyzed, and the sequence of the original DNA template is determined based on the identity of the terminating ddNTPs. In modern applications, fluorescently labeled ddNTPs are often used, allowing for automated detection and sequencing.\n\n### Applications\nSanger sequencing is still actively used in various fields, including public health initiatives, such as sequencing viral genomes (e.g., the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2) and monitoring outbreaks of diseases like norovirus. Its high accuracy (around 99.99%) makes it a reliable method for sequencing short DNA fragments.\n\nIn summary, Sanger sequencing remains a foundational technique in genomics, providing precise and reliable DNA sequence information that is crucial for research and clinical applications.
