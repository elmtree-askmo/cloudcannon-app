    What is the function of transfer RNA (tRNA) in protein synthesis?
answer: >-
    Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays a crucial role in the process of protein synthesis, specifically during the translation phase. Here are the key functions and characteristics of tRNA:\n\n1. **Amino Acid Transport**: tRNA is responsible for transporting specific amino acids to the ribosome, the cellular machinery where protein synthesis occurs. Each tRNA molecule is linked to a particular amino acid, which it carries to the ribosome.\n\n2. **Anticodon-Codon Pairing**: Each tRNA has a unique three-nucleotide sequence known as an anticodon. This anticodon pairs with a corresponding codon on the messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. The codons on the mRNA are sequences of three nucleotides that specify which amino acid should be added next in the growing polypeptide chain. This pairing ensures that the correct amino acid is incorporated into the protein being synthesized.\n\n3. **Polypeptide Chain Formation**: As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, tRNA molecules sequentially bring their attached amino acids to the ribosome. The ribosome facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, leading to the elongation of the polypeptide chain.\n\n4. **Structure**: tRNA has a characteristic cloverleaf structure, which allows it to fit into the ribosome and interact with both the mRNA and the amino acids. The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between complementary bases.\n\n5. **Types of tRNA**: There are different types of tRNA, each specific to a particular amino acid. This specificity is crucial for the accuracy of protein synthesis.\n\nIn summary, tRNA is essential for translating the genetic code carried by mRNA into a specific sequence of amino acids, ultimately forming proteins that perform various functions within the cell.
