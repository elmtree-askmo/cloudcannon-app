    What is the difference between essential and non-essential amino acids?
answer: >-
    The primary difference between essential and non-essential amino acids lies in the body's ability to synthesize them. \n\n1. **Essential Amino Acids**: These are amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through dietary sources. There are nine essential amino acids for adults, which include:\n   - Isoleucine\n   - Leucine\n   - Lysine\n   - Methionine\n   - Phenylalanine\n   - Threonine\n   - Tryptophan\n   - Valine\n   - Histidine (considered essential for infants)\n\n   Essential amino acids play critical roles in various bodily functions, including muscle development, repair, and the production of neurotransmitters, which are vital for the nervous system.\n\n2. **Non-Essential Amino Acids**: These amino acids can be synthesized by the body from other amino acids and carbohydrates. There are eleven non-essential amino acids, which include:\n   - Alanine\n   - Asparagine\n   - Aspartic acid\n   - Cysteine\n   - Glutamic acid\n   - Glutamine\n   - Glycine\n   - Proline\n   - Serine\n   - Tyrosine\n   - Arginine (conditionally essential in certain situations)\n\n   Non-essential amino acids are involved in various functions, such as energy production and the synthesis of other important biomolecules.\n\n### Summary of Differences:\n- **Synthesis**: Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body; non-essential amino acids can be synthesized.\n- **Dietary Requirement**: Essential amino acids must be obtained from food; non-essential amino acids do not have to be consumed as they can be produced internally.\n- **Number**: There are nine essential amino acids and eleven non-essential amino acids.\n\nDeficiencies in essential amino acids can lead to significant health issues, such as a weakened immune system, while deficiencies in non-essential amino acids are rare but can occur under specific conditions, such as starvation or illness.
