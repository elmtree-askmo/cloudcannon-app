    What are the primary types of macromolecules, and what are their basic functions?
answer: >-
    Macromolecules are large, complex molecules that are essential for life and play critical roles in biological processes. The primary types of macromolecules include:\n\n1. **Proteins**:\n   - **Composition**: Proteins are polymers made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. There are 20 standard amino acids, each with unique side chains that determine their properties.\n   - **Functions**: Proteins serve a variety of functions, including:\n     - Catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes)\n     - Providing structural support (e.g., collagen in connective tissues)\n     - Facilitating communication and signaling between cells (e.g., hormones)\n     - Transporting molecules (e.g., hemoglobin transporting oxygen)\n\n2. **Nucleic Acids**:\n   - **Composition**: Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are polymers made up of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n   - **Functions**: Nucleic acids are primarily involved in:\n     - Storing and transmitting genetic information (DNA)\n     - Synthesizing proteins (RNA, particularly messenger RNA or mRNA)\n     - Regulating gene expression and cellular activities (various forms of RNA)\n\n3. **Carbohydrates**:\n   - **Composition**: Carbohydrates are composed of sugar monomers (monosaccharides) that can link together to form disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose).\n   - **Functions**: Carbohydrates serve several key roles, including:\n     - Providing energy (glucose is a primary energy source)\n     - Storing energy (glycogen in animals and starch in plants)\n     - Serving as structural components (cellulose in plant cell walls)\n     - Facilitating cell recognition and signaling (glycoproteins and glycolipids)\n\n4. **Lipids**:\n   - **Composition**: Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids. They are not polymers in the traditional sense but are often grouped together due to their hydrophobic nature.\n   - **Functions**: Lipids have various functions, such as:\n     - Storing energy (triglycerides)\n     - Forming cell membranes (phospholipids create the lipid bilayer)\n     - Acting as signaling molecules (steroids and hormones)\n     - Providing insulation and protection (fat deposits in animals)\n\nThese macromolecules are fundamental to the structure and function of cells, and their specific arrangements and interactions determine their biological roles. Understanding these macromolecules is crucial for studying cellular processes and the overall functioning of living organisms.
