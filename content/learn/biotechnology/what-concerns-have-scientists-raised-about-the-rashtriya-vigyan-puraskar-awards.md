    What concerns have scientists raised about the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar awards?
answer: >-
    Concerns raised by scientists regarding the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP), India's top science award, primarily revolve around the integrity and transparency of the selection process. Nearly 200 scientists and academicians have expressed apprehension about "non-academic considerations" influencing the selection of award recipients. This concern was particularly highlighted by the alleged exclusion of three distinguished scientists from the final list of potential awardees, which has led to questions about the fairness of the process.\n\nSome of the scientists involved in the selection process have voiced their worries, suggesting that the removal of these names may have been influenced by factors unrelated to academic merit. This situation has prompted calls for greater transparency in the selection procedures, with a group of 26 scientists, including former Bhatnagar Award winners, writing to the Principal Scientific Advisor to seek clarity on the matter.\n\nThe RVP was introduced to streamline and replace a multitude of scientific honors previously awarded by various government departments. However, the controversy surrounding the selection process has raised doubts about the awards' credibility and the motivations behind the decisions made by the awarding committee.
