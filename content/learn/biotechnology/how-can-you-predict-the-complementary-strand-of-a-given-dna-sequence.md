answer: >-
    To predict the complementary strand of a given DNA sequence, you can utilize the rules of complementary base pairing. Each nitrogenous base in DNA pairs with a specific partner as follows:\n\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)\n- Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A)\n- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G)\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)\n\nWhen you have a DNA strand, you can determine the complementary strand by replacing each base with its corresponding pair. It is also crucial to consider the directionality of the strands; DNA strands are antiparallel, meaning one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction while the complementary strand runs in the 3' to 5' direction.\n\n### Example\nIf you have the following DNA sequence:\n\n5’ – T - A - C - G - G - T - A - A - G - G - C - C - A - T - C – 3’\n\nTo find the complementary strand, you would pair each base as follows:\n\n- T pairs with A\n- A pairs with T\n- C pairs with G\n- G pairs with C\n\nThus, the complementary strand would be:\n\n3’ – A - T - G - C - C - A - T - T - C - C - G - G - T - A - G – 5’\n\nThis method can be applied to any DNA sequence to predict its complementary strand accurately.
