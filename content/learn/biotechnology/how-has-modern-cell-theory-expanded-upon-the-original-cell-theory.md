    How has modern cell theory expanded upon the original cell theory?
answer: >-
    Modern cell theory has expanded upon the original cell theory, which was established in 1839 by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. The original cell theory consisted of three main principles: \n\n1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n2. The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living things.\n3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells (a principle later emphasized by Rudolf Virchow in 1858).\n\nThe modern cell theory incorporates additional insights that have emerged from advancements in biological research and technology. Here are the key expansions:\n\n1. **DNA Transmission**: Modern cell theory posits that DNA is passed between cells during cell division, highlighting the genetic continuity and the role of DNA in heredity and cellular function.\n\n2. **Uniformity Among Similar Species**: It asserts that the cells of all organisms within a similar species are mostly the same, both structurally and chemically. This principle emphasizes the commonality of cellular structures across similar organisms.\n\n3. **Energy Flow**: Modern cell theory recognizes that energy flow occurs within cells, which is crucial for understanding metabolic processes and cellular respiration.\n\nThese expansions reflect a deeper understanding of cellular processes and the molecular basis of life, facilitated by advancements in microscopy and biochemistry. The development of techniques such as electron microscopy has allowed scientists to observe cellular structures in greater detail, leading to the discovery of various organelles and their specific functions.\n\nIn summary, while the original cell theory laid the foundational principles of cellular biology, modern cell theory has broadened our understanding by incorporating genetic, structural, and energetic aspects of cells, thus providing a more comprehensive view of cellular life.
