    Can you provide an overview of Phenomic AI and its mission in cancer research?
answer: >-
    Phenomic AI is a biopharmaceutical company based in Canada that focuses on addressing the challenges posed by the tumor stroma, a complex tissue environment that significantly contributes to poor treatment outcomes in many solid tumors. The company's mission is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to identify drug targets that emerge from cell-cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment, particularly in stroma-rich cancers such as colorectal and pancreatic cancers.\n\nRecently, Phenomic AI has made headlines by securing strategic collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim and Astellas-owned Xyphos Biosciences, to advance cancer cell therapy research. These partnerships aim to discover and develop therapies that can effectively target cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor stroma, which are known to hinder the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.\n\nThe company launched with $6 million in seed funding, which it plans to utilize to advance its lead candidates into proof-of-concept studies. Phenomic AI's innovative approach combines AI/ML platforms with a focus on antibody drug discovery, aiming to reveal novel therapeutic targets that can improve treatment outcomes for patients with challenging cancers.\n\nIn addition to its scientific endeavors, Phenomic AI has assembled a distinguished Scientific Advisory Board, including notable figures such as Nobel Laureate James P. Allison and Dr. Padmanee Sharma, who bring extensive expertise in immunotherapy and cancer research. This strategic leadership is expected to guide the company's efforts in developing effective cancer therapies that can overcome the barriers posed by the tumor stroma.\n\nOverall, Phenomic AI is positioned at the forefront of cancer research, utilizing cutting-edge technology to tackle one of the most significant challenges in oncology today.
