    What distinguishes eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells in terms of structure?
answer: >-
    Eukaryotic cells are distinguished from prokaryotic cells primarily by their structural complexity and the presence of membrane-bound organelles. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Nucleus**: \n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: These cells have a well-defined nucleus that houses the cell's genetic material (DNA). The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane, which separates it from the cytoplasm.\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: In contrast, prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Their genetic material is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not enclosed by a membrane.\n\n2. **Organelles**:\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: They contain various membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell), endoplasmic reticulum (involved in protein and lipid synthesis), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and others. These organelles perform specific functions that contribute to the cell's overall operation.\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles. They may have ribosomes, but these are not membrane-bound and are generally smaller than those found in eukaryotic cells.\n\n3. **Size**:\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Typically larger and more complex, eukaryotic cells can range from about 10 to 100 micrometers in diameter.\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Generally smaller, prokaryotic cells usually range from about 0.1 to 5 micrometers in diameter.\n\n4. **Cell Structure**:\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: They have a more complex structure with a cytoskeleton that provides shape and support, and they can be unicellular or multicellular organisms (e.g., plants, animals, fungi).\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: These cells are simpler and are primarily unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and archaea.\n\n5. **Cell Division**:\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: They divide by mitosis (for somatic cells) and meiosis (for gametes), which involves complex processes of chromosome alignment and separation.\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: They reproduce asexually through binary fission, a simpler process where the cell divides into two identical cells.\n\nIn summary, the presence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, along with differences in size, complexity, and methods of reproduction, are the primary characteristics that distinguish eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells.
