    What are the key principles of Mendelian gene theory?
answer: >-
    Mendelian gene theory, established by Gregor Mendel in the 19th century, is foundational to the field of genetics and describes how traits are inherited from one generation to the next. The key principles of Mendelian gene theory include:\n\n1. **Law of Segregation**: This principle states that during the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells), the two alleles for a trait segregate from each other. Each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. When fertilization occurs, the offspring receive one allele from each parent, restoring the pair.\n\n2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: According to this law, the alleles for different traits segregate independently of one another during gamete formation. This means that the inheritance of one trait will not affect the inheritance of another trait, provided the genes are located on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome.\n\n3. **Law of Dominance**: This principle states that in a heterozygote (an organism with two different alleles for a trait), one allele may mask the expression of the other. The allele that is expressed is termed the dominant allele, while the masked allele is referred to as the recessive allele.\n\nMendel's experiments with pea plants led to the formulation of these laws. He observed that certain traits, such as flower color and seed shape, followed predictable patterns of inheritance. For example, when he cross-bred pure-bred plants with different traits, the first generation (F1) exhibited only the dominant traits, while the second generation (F2) displayed a mix of both dominant and recessive traits in a specific ratio, typically 3:1 for dominant to recessive traits.\n\nThese principles laid the groundwork for classical genetics and have been instrumental in understanding more complex inheritance patterns, including polygenic inheritance and the influence of environmental factors on gene expression. Mendel's work was later integrated with the chromosome theory of inheritance, solidifying his status as the "Father of Genetics."
