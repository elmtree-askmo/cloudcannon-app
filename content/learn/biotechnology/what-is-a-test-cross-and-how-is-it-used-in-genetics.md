    A test cross is a genetic experiment used to determine the genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype by crossing it with a homozygous recessive individual. This method helps identify whether the dominant phenotype parent is homozygous dominant or heterozygous.

    What is a test cross and how is it used in genetics?
answer: >-
    A test cross is a genetic breeding experiment used to determine the genotype of an organism exhibiting a dominant phenotype. This method involves crossing the organism of unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual. The primary purpose of a test cross is to ascertain whether the dominant phenotype parent is homozygous dominant (having two copies of the dominant allele) or heterozygous (having one dominant and one recessive allele).\n\nThe concept of the test cross was first employed by Gregor Mendel during his studies of pea plants, where he sought to understand the inheritance of traits. For example, if a yellow pea plant (dominant phenotype) is crossed with a homozygous recessive green pea plant, the resulting offspring's phenotypes can reveal the genotype of the yellow parent. If all offspring display the dominant yellow trait, the yellow parent is homozygous dominant (YY). However, if some offspring exhibit the recessive green trait, the yellow parent must be heterozygous (Yy).\n\nIn summary, a test cross is a powerful tool in genetics that allows scientists to determine the genetic makeup of an organism by analyzing the phenotypes of its offspring. This method remains relevant today, providing foundational knowledge for more advanced genetic testing techniques.
