    What are the expected phenotypic ratios in a monohybrid cross?
answer: >-
    In a monohybrid cross, which examines the inheritance of a single trait, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1. This means that for every three offspring exhibiting the dominant phenotype, there is one offspring exhibiting the recessive phenotype. \n\nFor example, if we consider a cross between two heterozygous parents (Tt x Tt), where "T" represents the dominant allele (e.g., tall plants) and "t" represents the recessive allele (e.g., short plants), the resulting phenotypic ratio in the offspring would be:\n\n- 3 tall plants (TT or Tt)\n- 1 short plant (tt)\n\nThis can be visualized using a Punnett square:\n\n```\n       T     t\n     ------------\nT |   TT   |  Tt  |\n     ------------\nt |   Tt   |  tt  |\n     ------------\n```\n\nFrom this Punnett square, we can see that the genotypes produced are:\n- 1 TT (homozygous dominant)\n- 2 Tt (heterozygous)\n- 1 tt (homozygous recessive)\n\nThus, the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt), but when we focus on the phenotypes, we derive the 3:1 ratio (3 tall : 1 short).\n\nThis foundational concept in Mendelian genetics illustrates how traits are inherited and provides a basis for predicting the outcomes of genetic crosses.
