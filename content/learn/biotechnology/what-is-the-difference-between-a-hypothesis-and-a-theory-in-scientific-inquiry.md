    What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory in scientific inquiry?
answer: >-
    In scientific inquiry, the distinction between a hypothesis and a theory is fundamental and revolves around their definitions, scope, and the level of evidence supporting them.\n\n1. **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observed phenomenon. It is a specific, testable statement that predicts the outcome of an experiment or observation. For example, one might hypothesize that "if plants are given more sunlight, then they will grow taller." This statement can be tested through experimentation, and the results can either support or refute the hypothesis.\n\n2. **Theory**: In contrast, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence collected through observation and experimentation over time. Theories integrate multiple hypotheses and observations, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding complex systems. For instance, the theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how species evolve through differential survival and reproduction based on environmental adaptations.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Scope**: Hypotheses are narrow and focused on specific predictions, while theories encompass broader explanations that integrate various hypotheses and evidence.\n- **Evidence**: A hypothesis is supported by initial observations and can be tested in a limited context. A theory, however, is supported by extensive evidence from numerous studies and experiments, making it a robust explanation of natural phenomena.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction is crucial for appreciating the rigor and depth of scientific inquiry. Theories are not mere guesses; they are foundational to scientific knowledge and are continually tested and refined as new evidence emerges.
