    What is the basic definition of an atom in biochemistry?
answer: >-
    In biochemistry, an atom is defined as the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all molecules, including essential biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), carbohydrates, and lipids. \n\nEach atom consists of three primary subatomic particles:\n- **Protons**: Positively charged particles located in the nucleus of the atom.\n- **Neutrons**: Neutral particles, also found in the nucleus, that contribute to the atomic mass but do not affect the charge.\n- **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in various energy levels.\n\nThe number of protons in an atom's nucleus defines its atomic number, which determines the element's identity. For example, hydrogen has one proton and an atomic number of 1, making it the lightest element. \n\nUnderstanding the structure and behavior of atoms is crucial in biochemistry because it underpins the formation of molecules, the nature of chemical reactions, and the interactions that sustain life. The interactions between atoms through various types of chemical bonds (such as covalent and ionic bonds) are fundamental to the formation of the complex structures necessary for biological functions.
