    How do dominant and recessive alleles affect genetic traits?
answer: >-
    Dominant and recessive alleles play a crucial role in determining genetic traits through their inheritance patterns. \n\n**Dominant Alleles**: A dominant allele can express its trait even if only one copy is present. This means that if an individual has at least one dominant allele (represented as a capital letter, e.g., "B"), the dominant trait will be observed in the phenotype. For example, in the case of eye color, if "B" represents the allele for brown eyes, an individual with genotypes "BB" (homozygous dominant) or "Bb" (heterozygous) will exhibit brown eyes.\n\n**Recessive Alleles**: In contrast, a recessive allele (represented as a lowercase letter, e.g., "b") will only manifest its trait if two copies are present (homozygous recessive, "bb"). For instance, if both parents contribute the recessive allele "b," the child will have blue eyes, even if both parents have brown eyes (genotypes "Bb"). \n\nThe inheritance of these alleles can be illustrated using a Punnett square. For example, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb), all offspring will be heterozygous (Bb) and display the dominant trait. However, if both parents are heterozygous (Bb), there is a 75% chance the offspring will exhibit the dominant trait (BB or Bb) and a 25% chance they will exhibit the recessive trait (bb).\n\nIn summary, dominant alleles can mask the expression of recessive alleles, leading to a variety of phenotypes based on the combination of alleles inherited from the parents. This fundamental concept is essential for understanding genetic traits and their inheritance patterns in organisms.
