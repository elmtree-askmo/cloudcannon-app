    Codominance is a genetic phenomenon where two different alleles are fully expressed in a heterozygous individual, resulting in a phenotype that displays characteristics of both alleles, as exemplified by the ABO blood type.

    What is codominance and how does it manifest in genetic traits?
answer: >-
    Codominance is a genetic phenomenon where two different alleles at a single locus are both fully expressed in a heterozygous individual, resulting in a phenotype that displays characteristics of both alleles. This form of inheritance differs from simple dominance, where one allele masks the effect of another. In codominance, both alleles contribute equally to the organism's traits.\n\nA classic example of codominance is found in the human ABO blood group system. In this system, the A and B alleles are codominant. When an individual inherits one A allele and one B allele, they express both traits simultaneously, resulting in the AB blood type. This means that both A and B antigens are present on the surface of the red blood cells.\n\nAnother example can be seen in the MN blood group system, where individuals homozygous for the M allele express the M antigen, while those homozygous for the N allele express the N antigen. Heterozygous individuals express both antigens, demonstrating codominance.\n\nIn animals, codominance can be observed in speckled chickens, which exhibit both black and white feathers, and in roan cattle, which display a mix of red and white hair. In these cases, the presence of both alleles results in a distinct phenotype that showcases the contributions of each allele without one overshadowing the other.\n\nOverall, codominance is an important concept in genetics that illustrates how multiple alleles can interact to produce diverse phenotypic outcomes.
