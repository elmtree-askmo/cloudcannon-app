    Define acids and bases according to the proton donor-acceptor concept.
answer: >-
    In chemistry, the definitions of acids and bases can be understood through the proton donor-acceptor concept. According to this concept:\n\n- **Acids** are substances that can donate protons (H+) in a chemical reaction. This means that when an acid is present in a solution, it can release hydrogen ions, increasing the concentration of H+ in that solution.\n\n- **Bases**, on the other hand, are substances that can accept protons (H+). When a base is introduced into a solution, it can either bind to free hydrogen ions or produce hydroxide ions (OH-), which can also lead to a decrease in the concentration of H+.\n\nThis proton donor-acceptor concept is foundational in understanding acid-base reactions, where the transfer of protons between acids and bases occurs. \n\nGilbert Lewis further expanded the definitions of acids and bases by introducing the Lewis acid-base theory. In this framework:\n\n- A **Lewis acid** is defined as an electron pair acceptor, meaning it can accept a pair of electrons from another species during a reaction.\n- A **Lewis base** is an electron pair donor, meaning it can donate a pair of electrons to another species.\n\nThis broader definition allows for a more comprehensive understanding of various chemical reactions beyond just proton transfer, encompassing reactions that involve electron pair interactions.\n\nIn summary, under the proton donor-acceptor concept:\n- Acids donate protons (H+).\n- Bases accept protons (H+). \n\nThis understanding is crucial for studying chemical reactions, particularly in biochemistry and organic chemistry, where acid-base interactions play a significant role in molecular behavior and reactivity.
