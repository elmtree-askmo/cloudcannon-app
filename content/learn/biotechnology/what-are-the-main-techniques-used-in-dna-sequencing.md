    What are the main techniques used in DNA sequencing?
answer: >-
    The main techniques used in DNA sequencing can be categorized into classical methods and high-throughput approaches. Here are the key techniques:\n\n1. **Sanger Sequencing**: Developed by Frederick Sanger in 1977, this method is based on chain termination. It uses dideoxynucleotides to interrupt DNA synthesis, allowing for the determination of the sequence of bases in a DNA fragment. Sanger sequencing is known for its high accuracy and is often used for smaller projects.\n\n2. **Maxam-Gilbert Sequencing**: This method, developed by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert, relies on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases. It requires radioactive labeling and is less commonly used today due to its complexity and safety concerns.\n\n3. **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: This encompasses a variety of high-throughput methods that allow for the simultaneous sequencing of millions of DNA fragments. NGS technologies include:\n   - **Illumina Sequencing**: A widely used method that employs sequencing by synthesis, producing short reads (typically 100-300 base pairs).\n   - **Ion Torrent Sequencing**: This method detects changes in pH as nucleotides are incorporated during DNA synthesis.\n   - **Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequencing**: Known for its long-read capabilities, this method uses single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology.\n   - **Oxford Nanopore Sequencing**: This technique involves passing DNA strands through nanopores and measuring changes in electrical current to determine the sequence.\n\n4. **Capillary Electrophoresis**: Often used in conjunction with Sanger sequencing, this method separates DNA fragments based on size and is used for analyzing the results of sequencing reactions.\n\n5. **Hybridization Methods**: These techniques involve the binding of labeled DNA probes to complementary sequences in a sample, allowing for the identification of specific sequences.\n\n6. **Third-Generation Sequencing**: This includes methods that aim to increase throughput and reduce costs, such as nanopore sequencing and techniques that measure electrical tunneling currents across single-strand DNA.\n\n7. **Microscopy-Based Techniques**: These methods, still under development, utilize atomic force microscopy or transmission electron microscopy to visualize individual nucleotides within long DNA fragments.\n\nThese techniques have evolved significantly over the years, with high-throughput methods now dominating the field due to their ability to produce large amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively. Each method has its strengths and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in genomics research.
