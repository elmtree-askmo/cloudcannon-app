    List the nitrogenous bases found in DNA and RNA.
answer: >-
    The nitrogenous bases found in DNA and RNA are as follows:\n\n### Nitrogenous Bases in DNA:\n1. **Adenine (A)**\n2. **Thymine (T)**\n3. **Cytosine (C)**\n4. **Guanine (G)**\n\n### Nitrogenous Bases in RNA:\n1. **Adenine (A)**\n2. **Uracil (U)** (replaces thymine)\n3. **Cytosine (C)**\n4. **Guanine (G)**\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Thymine (T)** is present in DNA but is replaced by **Uracil (U)** in RNA. \n- Both DNA and RNA contain **Adenine (A)**, **Cytosine (C)**, and **Guanine (G)**.\n\nThese nitrogenous bases play a crucial role in encoding genetic information and are fundamental to the structure and function of nucleic acids. In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine, while in RNA, adenine pairs with uracil.
