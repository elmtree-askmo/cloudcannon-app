    How is fitness measured in biological terms?
answer: >-
    In biological terms, fitness is a measure of an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its specific environment. It is a key concept in the theory of evolution by natural selection. Fitness is often quantified by the following criteria:\n\n1. **Reproductive Success**: The primary way to measure fitness is by counting the number of offspring an individual produces that survive to reproductive age. An organism that produces a greater number of viable offspring is considered to have higher fitness. For example, a plant species that can produce a large number of seeds that successfully germinate and grow will be regarded as having higher fitness compared to a species that produces fewer viable seeds.\n\n2. **Survival Rate**: Fitness can also be assessed by the survival rate of individuals within a population. Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, thus contributing more to the gene pool of future generations.\n\n3. **Adaptation to Environment**: Fitness is influenced by how well an organism's traits are suited to its environment. For instance, a rabbit that is faster or better camouflaged in its habitat may have a higher fitness compared to others that lack these advantageous traits.\n\n4. **Genetic Contribution**: Fitness is not just about the number of offspring but also about the genetic quality of those offspring. If the offspring inherit advantageous traits that enhance their survival and reproductive success, the parent organism's fitness is considered higher.\n\nIn summary, fitness in biological terms is primarily measured by reproductive success, survival rates, and the adaptability of traits to the environment. Higher fitness indicates that an organism is better suited to its environment, leading to greater reproductive success and a more significant contribution to the next generation's gene pool.
