    What were the contributions of Morgan and Sturtevant to chromosomal genetics?
answer: >-
    Thomas Hunt Morgan and Alfred Henry Sturtevant made significant contributions to the field of chromosomal genetics, particularly through their work with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nMorgan is best known for formulating the "Chromosome Theory of Heredity," which posits that genes are located on chromosomes and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis explains inheritance patterns. His research laid the groundwork for modern genetics, and by the 1920s, his theories were widely accepted among geneticists.\n\nSturtevant, who was Morgan's undergraduate student, played a crucial role in advancing these ideas. In 1913, he created one of the first genetic maps of a chromosome by utilizing recombination frequencies. He discovered that the frequency of crossing over between two genes is inversely related to the distance between them; that is, genes that are farther apart on a chromosome are more likely to be separated during recombination. This relationship allowed him to map the relative positions of genes on the Drosophila X chromosome, effectively establishing the concept of genetic linkage.\n\nSturtevant's work was foundational in the development of linkage maps, which are essential for understanding the genetic architecture of organisms. His mapping techniques and the concept of recombination frequency have had lasting impacts on genetics, influencing both theoretical and applied research in the field.\n\nTogether, Morgan and Sturtevant's contributions helped to establish the principles of chromosomal inheritance and laid the groundwork for future genetic research, making them pivotal figures in the history of genetics.
