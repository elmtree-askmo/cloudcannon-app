answer: >-
    Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants, specifically the garden pea (Pisum sativum), were foundational in the field of genetics. He focused on seven key characteristics of these plants, which were easily identifiable and allowed for controlled breeding experiments. The key characteristics Mendel studied included:\n\n1. **Flower Color**: Pea plants could have either purple or white flowers.\n2. **Seed Texture**: Seeds could be smooth or wrinkled.\n3. **Seed Color**: Seeds could be yellow or green.\n4. **Stem Length**: Plants could be tall or short.\n5. **Pod Color**: Pods could be green or yellow.\n6. **Pod Texture**: Pods could be inflated or constricted.\n7. **Flower Position**: Flowers could be positioned either axial (along the stem) or terminal (at the end of the stem).\n\nMendel's choice of pea plants was strategic; they have distinct traits that can be easily observed, and their reproduction can be manipulated through controlled pollination. This allowed him to cross-pollinate plants with different traits and observe the inheritance patterns in the offspring. For example, when he crossed plants with yellow seeds and green seeds, he found that the yellow trait was dominant, as all offspring produced yellow seeds.\n\nThrough his meticulous experiments, Mendel established the principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment, which are fundamental to understanding genetic inheritance. His work laid the groundwork for modern genetics and demonstrated how traits are passed from parents to offspring.
