    What are the main categories of bio-agents used in bioterrorism?
answer: >-
    The main categories of bio-agents used in bioterrorism are classified based on their potential impact on public health and the ease with which they can be disseminated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established a classification system that includes three primary categories:\n\n1. **Category A Agents**: These are considered the highest risk to national security and public health. They can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, result in high mortality rates, and may cause public panic and social disruption. Examples include:\n   - Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)\n   - Smallpox (Variola major)\n   - Plague (Yersinia pestis)\n   - Tularemia (Francisella tularensis)\n   - Botulism (Clostridium botulinum toxin)\n\n2. **Category B Agents**: These agents are moderately easy to disseminate and result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates. They require specific enhancements of diagnostic capacity and public health surveillance. Examples include:\n   - Brucellosis (Brucella species)\n   - Glanders (Burkholderia mallei)\n   - Q fever (Coxiella burnetii)\n   - Ricin toxin (from castor beans)\n\n3. **Category C Agents**: These are emerging threats that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future. They are not currently considered as high risk as Category A or B agents but could pose a significant threat due to their potential for widespread impact. Examples include:\n   - Nipah virus\n   - Hantavirus\n   - Tick-borne encephalitis virus\n\nThis classification system helps prioritize research, preparedness, and response efforts to mitigate the risks associated with bioterrorism.
