    How do introns and exons differ in mRNA processing?
answer: >-
    In mRNA processing, introns and exons serve distinct roles in the maturation of the primary RNA transcript. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Exons** are the coding sequences of a gene that are retained in the mature mRNA. They are responsible for encoding the amino acid sequence of proteins.\n   - **Introns**, on the other hand, are non-coding sequences that are interspersed between exons in the primary RNA transcript. They do not code for proteins and are removed during the processing of mRNA.\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - During mRNA processing, introns are excised from the pre-mRNA through a process known as RNA splicing. This results in the joining of exons to form a continuous coding sequence in the mature mRNA.\n   - Exons are preserved and ultimately exit the nucleus to be translated into proteins in the cytoplasm.\n\n3. **Location**:\n   - Introns remain in the nucleus after being spliced out, while exons are transported out of the nucleus as part of the mature mRNA.\n\n4. **Conservation**:\n   - Exon sequences are generally highly conserved across different species, reflecting their essential role in coding for proteins. In contrast, intron sequences can vary significantly and may change over time.\n\n5. **Functionality**:\n   - While introns are often considered non-coding, they can play roles in gene regulation and may influence the expression of the associated genes. Some introns are involved in alternative splicing, which allows for the production of multiple protein variants from a single gene.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between introns and exons lies in their coding potential and their fate during mRNA processing: exons are retained and translated, while introns are removed and typically do not contribute to the final protein product.
