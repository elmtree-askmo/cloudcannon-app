    When was the Cricketers for Wildlife Conservation Service Award established?
answer: >-
    The Cricketers for Wildlife Conservation Service Award was established to honor individuals who work tirelessly for forest conservation. While the exact year of establishment is not explicitly mentioned in the gathered information, it is noted that the Wildlife Service Awards have been recognizing the efforts of forest footsoldiers since the 2010-11 season. This suggests that the initiative likely began around that time, with the awards being part of a broader effort by former cricketers Sandeep Patil, Yusuf Pathan, and Harbhajan Singh, who were instrumental in creating this award.\n\nIf you need more specific details or a precise year of establishment, I cannot answer this question based on the available information, as it does not provide a definitive date for the inception of the award.
