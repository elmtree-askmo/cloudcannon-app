    Explain the base pairing rules for DNA, including the specific pairs involved.
answer: >-
    The base pairing rules for DNA are fundamental to understanding its structure and function. In DNA, the specific pairs of nitrogenous bases that form the rungs of the double helix are as follows:\n\n1. **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)**: This pairing occurs through the formation of two hydrogen bonds.\n2. **Cytosine (C)** pairs with **Guanine (G)**: This pairing is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds.\n\nThese pairings are crucial for the stability of the DNA molecule and play a significant role in processes such as DNA replication and transcription.\n\nAdditionally, Chargaff's rules state that in any given DNA molecule, the percentage of adenine (A) is equal to the percentage of thymine (T), and the percentage of cytosine (C) is equal to the percentage of guanine (G). This means that if you know the percentage of one base, you can determine the percentage of its complementary base.\n\nIn RNA, the base pairing rules differ slightly; adenine (A) pairs with **Uracil (U)** instead of thymine (T). \n\nTo summarize, the base pairing rules for DNA can be outlined as follows:\n- A pairs with T\n- C pairs with G\n\nThese rules ensure the accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division and the synthesis of proteins.
