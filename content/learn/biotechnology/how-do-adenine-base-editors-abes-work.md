    How do adenine base editors (ABEs) work?
answer: >-
    Adenine base editors (ABEs) are a revolutionary tool in the field of genome editing, designed to enable precise and permanent conversion of adenine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the cellular machinery as guanine (G). This results in an A·T to G·C base pair change, which can be crucial for correcting specific genetic mutations associated with various diseases.\n\nThe development of ABEs was pioneered by Nicole Gaudelli and her colleagues in David Liu's lab, who created the first adenine base editor in 2017. The construction of an ABE involves fusing an engineered adenine deaminase to a catalytically inactive variant of the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas), typically Cas9. This fusion allows the ABE to target specific DNA sequences guided by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) while facilitating the deamination process.\n\nThe mechanism of action for ABEs involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Targeting**: The ABE is directed to a specific genomic location by the sgRNA, which binds to the complementary DNA sequence.\n\n2. **Deamination**: Once bound, the deaminase domain of the ABE catalyzes the conversion of adenine to inosine at the target site. This process is highly efficient, often achieving editing efficiencies exceeding 50% in living cells, with minimal byproducts such as random insertions or deletions.\n\n3. **DNA Repair**: The presence of inosine in the DNA is recognized and processed by the cellular repair machinery, which ultimately results in the conversion of the original A·T base pair to a G·C base pair.\n\nABEs are particularly valuable because they can address a wide range of human disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high precision. However, it is important to note that current base editing technologies, including ABEs, are limited to specific types of base pair changes (A·T to G·C) and do not yet facilitate transversion mutations or other complex edits.\n\nIn summary, adenine base editors represent a significant advancement in genome editing technology, providing a powerful method for precise genetic modifications that hold promise for therapeutic applications in genetic diseases.
