    What is the primary function of the cytoskeleton in animal cells?
answer: >-
    The primary function of the cytoskeleton in animal cells is to provide structural support and shape to the cell. It is a dynamic network of protein filaments and tubules that plays several critical roles, including:\n\n1. **Maintaining Cell Shape**: The cytoskeleton helps the cell maintain its shape and resist deformation, acting like a scaffold.\n\n2. **Cell Movement**: It is involved in cellular movements, such as the movement of the entire cell (e.g., in amoeboid movement) and the movement of organelles within the cell.\n\n3. **Cell Division**: During mitosis, the cytoskeleton forms the mitotic spindle, which is essential for the separation of chromosomes.\n\n4. **Intracellular Transport**: The cytoskeleton facilitates the transport of materials within the cell, using motor proteins that move along the filaments.\n\n5. **Cell Signaling**: It plays a role in signal transduction pathways, helping to transmit signals from the cell surface to the interior.\n\nOverall, the cytoskeleton is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of animal cells.
