    What are the common structural features of amino acids?
answer: >-
    Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, share several common structural features that are essential for their function and classification. Here are the key structural characteristics of amino acids:\n\n1. **α Carbon**: Each amino acid contains a central carbon atom known as the α carbon. This carbon is the chiral center for all amino acids except for glycine.\n\n2. **Functional Groups**: Attached to the α carbon are four distinct groups:\n   - **Amino Group (-NH₂)**: This is a primary amine group that contributes to the basic properties of amino acids.\n   - **Carboxyl Group (-COOH)**: This group gives amino acids their acidic properties and is responsible for the carboxylic acid nature of amino acids.\n   - **Hydrogen Atom**: A single hydrogen atom is also attached to the α carbon.\n   - **R Group (Side Chain)**: This is the variable group that distinguishes one amino acid from another. The nature of the R group determines the specific properties and classification of the amino acid.\n\n3. **Chirality**: With the exception of glycine, which has a hydrogen atom as its R group and is therefore achiral, all other amino acids are chiral. This chirality allows them to exist in two mirror-image forms, known as L and D configurations. The L configuration is the most common in biological systems.\n\n4. **Tetrahedral Geometry**: The α carbon is tetrahedral in shape due to the four different substituents attached to it, which allows for the formation of various spatial arrangements of the amino acids.\n\n5. **Proline Exception**: Proline is unique among the amino acids because its R group is bonded to the α-amino group, forming a cyclic structure. This affects its properties and the way it participates in protein structures.\n\nIn summary, the common structural features of amino acids include the α carbon, the amino and carboxyl functional groups, a hydrogen atom, and a variable R group. These features are crucial for the diverse functions that amino acids perform in biological systems.
