    Describe the genetic basis of polydactyly and its inheritance pattern.
answer: >-
    Polydactyly is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of extra fingers or toes. The genetic basis of polydactyly is typically linked to mutations in specific genes that are involved in limb development. It is primarily inherited as an **autosomal dominant trait**, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary for the trait to be expressed in an individual. \n\n### Inheritance Pattern\nIn the case of polydactyly, if one parent carries the gene for the condition, there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the trait. This is illustrated in a simple Punnett square, where the dominant allele (P) for polydactyly is represented alongside the recessive allele (p) for normal digit count:\n\n|         | P       | p       |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| **P**   | PP      | Pp      |\n| **p**   | Pp      | pp      |\n\nIn this example:\n- **PP** and **Pp** individuals will exhibit polydactyly (phenotypically affected).\n- **pp** individuals will have a normal number of digits (phenotypically unaffected).\n\n### Variable Expressivity\nThe expressivity of polydactyly can vary widely among individuals who carry the gene. Some may have fully functional extra digits, while others may have small, non-functional nubs. This variability can be attributed to several factors, including:\n- **Developmental conditions**: The environment in which the individual develops can influence the expression of the trait.\n- **Genetic background**: Interactions with other genes may also affect how the trait is expressed.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as **variable expressivity**, where individuals with the same genotype (e.g., carrying the polydactyly allele) can exhibit different phenotypes.\n\nIn summary, polydactyly is an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity, influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Understanding this genetic basis is crucial for genetic counseling and studying inheritance patterns in families.
