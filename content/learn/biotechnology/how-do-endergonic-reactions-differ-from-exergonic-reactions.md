    How do endergonic reactions differ from exergonic reactions?
answer: >-
    Endergonic and exergonic reactions are two fundamental types of chemical reactions that differ primarily in their Gibbs free energy changes, spontaneity, and the direction of energy flow.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n1. **Gibbs Free Energy Change ($\Delta G$)**:\n   - **Exergonic Reactions**: These reactions have a negative change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G < 0$). This indicates that the products of the reaction have lower free energy than the reactants, resulting in a net release of free energy. Exergonic reactions are typically spontaneous and favorable, meaning they can occur without the need for additional energy input. An example of an exergonic reaction is the hydrolysis of ATP:\n     $$\n     \text{ATP} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i \quad (\Delta G \approx -7.3 \text{ kcal/mol})\n     $$\n\n2. **Energy Requirement**:\n   - **Endergonic Reactions**: In contrast, these reactions require an input of energy, resulting in a positive Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G > 0$). Endergonic reactions are non-spontaneous, meaning they cannot occur without the addition of energy. An example of an endergonic reaction is the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water during photosynthesis.\n\n3. **Spontaneity**:\n   - **Exergonic Reactions**: These reactions are spontaneous and favorable, often associated with catabolic processes where complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones, releasing energy that can be utilized by the organism.\n   - **Endergonic Reactions**: These are non-spontaneous and unfavorable, typically involved in anabolic processes where simple molecules are assembled into more complex structures, necessitating an input of energy.\n\n### Coupling of Reactions:\nIn biological systems, exergonic and endergonic reactions are often coupled. The energy released from exergonic reactions can be harnessed to drive endergonic reactions. This coupling is essential for maintaining the energy balance within cells and facilitating processes such as protein synthesis and muscle contraction.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, the main distinctions between endergonic and exergonic reactions lie in their Gibbs free energy changes, spontaneity, and energy flow. Exergonic reactions release energy and are spontaneous, while endergonic reactions absorb energy and are non-spontaneous. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending metabolic processes in biological systems.
