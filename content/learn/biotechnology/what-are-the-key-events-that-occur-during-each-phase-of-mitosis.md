    What are the key events that occur during each phase of mitosis?
answer: >-
    Mitosis is a crucial process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is conventionally divided into several distinct phases, each characterized by specific events:\n\n1. **Prophase**: This is the first stage of mitosis. During prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The nuclear envelope begins to disintegrate, and the mitotic spindle starts to form from the centrosomes, which move to opposite poles of the cell.\n\n2. **Metaphase**: In this phase, the spindle apparatus is fully formed, and the chromosomes align along the metaphase plate, which is an imaginary line equidistant from the two spindle poles. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes.\n\n3. **Anaphase**: During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers and move toward opposite poles of the cell. This separation ensures that each daughter cell will have an identical set of chromosomes. The cell begins to elongate as the poles move further apart.\n\n4. **Telophase**: In telophase, the separated chromosomes reach the poles and begin to decondense back into chromatin. The nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of chromosomes, resulting in two distinct nuclei within the cell. The mitotic spindle breaks down during this phase.\n\n5. **Cytokinesis**: Although not technically a phase of mitosis, cytokinesis often occurs concurrently with telophase. It is the process where the cytoplasm of the parent cell divides, resulting in two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, this is achieved through the formation of a cleavage furrow that pinches the cell in two. In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the metaphase plate, eventually leading to the formation of two separate cell walls.\n\nThese phases ensure the accurate distribution of genetic material to the daughter cells, maintaining genetic consistency across cell generations.
