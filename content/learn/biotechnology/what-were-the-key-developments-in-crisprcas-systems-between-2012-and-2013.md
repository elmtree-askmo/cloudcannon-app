    What were the key developments in CRISPR/Cas systems between 2012 and 2013?
answer: >-
    Between 2012 and 2013, several key developments in CRISPR/Cas systems significantly advanced the field of genome editing. \n\n1. **Discovery of Cas9 as an RNA-Programmable Endonuclease**: In 2012, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna demonstrated that the Cas9 protein could be programmed with a guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences for cleavage. This discovery marked a pivotal moment in molecular biology, as it provided a simple and efficient method for gene editing, leading to a surge of research and applications in various organisms.\n\n2. **Biochemical Characterization of Cas9**: Following the initial discovery, researchers, including Virginijus Siksnys, conducted biochemical experiments to characterize the mechanism of Cas9. They confirmed the requirement for protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) for Cas9 activity and elucidated the roles of the RuvC and HNH nuclease domains in DNA strand cleavage. This foundational work laid the groundwork for understanding how CRISPR/Cas9 functions at a molecular level.\n\n3. **Rapid Expansion of Applications**: By 2013, numerous studies began to emerge utilizing Cas9 for gene modification in human cells and other organisms. This period saw the first applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in creating knockout models and conducting genetic screens, showcasing its versatility and efficiency compared to previous gene-editing technologies like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs).\n\n4. **Formation of CRISPR Therapeutics and Other Companies**: The excitement around CRISPR technology led to the establishment of several biotech companies focused on harnessing CRISPR for therapeutic applications. Notably, Charpentier, Novak, Foy, and Cowan founded CRISPR Therapeutics, while Zhang, Church, and Doudna co-founded Editas Medicine, indicating a strong commercial interest in CRISPR technology.\n\nThese developments not only revolutionized gene editing but also set the stage for ongoing research and applications in medicine, agriculture, and beyond. The period from 2012 to 2013 is often regarded as the turning point that propelled CRISPR/Cas9 into the forefront of genetic engineering.
