    How do nucleosides contribute to the structure of nucleic acids?
answer: >-
    Nucleosides play a crucial role in the structure of nucleic acids, serving as the fundamental building blocks from which nucleotides are formed. A nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base (either a purine or a pyrimidine) linked to a five-carbon sugar (ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA) via a beta-glycosidic linkage at the 1' position of the sugar. This structure is essential for the formation of nucleotides, which are nucleosides that also include one or more phosphate groups.\n\n### Structure of Nucleosides\n1. **Components**: Each nucleoside is made up of:\n   - A nitrogenous base: This can be a purine (adenine or guanine) or a pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine, or uracil).\n   - A five-carbon sugar: Ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA.\n   \n2. **Linkage**: The nitrogenous base is attached to the sugar at the 1' carbon, forming a glycosidic bond. This bond is critical for the stability and integrity of the nucleic acid structure.\n\n### Contribution to Nucleic Acids\n- **Formation of Nucleotides**: Nucleosides are converted into nucleotides by the addition of phosphate groups. Nucleotides are the actual monomers that link together to form the polynucleotide chains of DNA and RNA through phosphodiester bonds.\n  \n- **Polynucleotide Structure**: In nucleic acids, nucleotides are linked together in a chain, where the phosphate group of one nucleotide connects to the 3' hydroxyl group of the sugar of the next nucleotide. This creates a sugar-phosphate backbone that is essential for the structural integrity of nucleic acids.\n\n- **Genetic Information Storage**: The sequence of nitrogenous bases in nucleic acids, which are derived from nucleosides, encodes genetic information. This sequence is critical for processes such as transcription and translation, which ultimately lead to protein synthesis.\n\n### Types of Nucleosides\n- **Purine Nucleosides**: Include adenine (forming adenosine) and guanine (forming guanosine). These nucleosides are characterized by their double-ring structure.\n  \n- **Pyrimidine Nucleosides**: Include cytosine (forming cytidine), thymine (forming thymidine), and uracil (forming uridine). These nucleosides have a single-ring structure.\n\nIn summary, nucleosides are integral to the structure of nucleic acids, as they form the basis for nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Their specific structures and the way they link together are fundamental to the storage and transmission of genetic information in all living organisms.
