    What distinguishes next-generation sequencing from traditional methods?
answer: >-
    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is distinguished from traditional sequencing methods, particularly the Sanger sequencing method, in several key ways:\n\n1. **Throughput and Speed**: NGS technologies allow for massively parallel sequencing, meaning they can sequence millions of DNA fragments simultaneously. This contrasts with Sanger sequencing, which typically sequences one fragment at a time, making NGS significantly faster and capable of handling larger volumes of genetic material.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**: NGS has a lower cost per base compared to Sanger sequencing, especially when sequencing large genomes or multiple samples. This cost-effectiveness has made NGS a preferred choice for large-scale genomic projects, such as population genomics and cancer research.\n\n3. **Sensitivity and Discovery Capacity**: NGS excels in detecting rare or low-frequency genetic variants due to its high sensitivity and depth of coverage. This capability is particularly important in applications like cancer genomics, where identifying mutations present in a small fraction of cells can be crucial.\n\n4. **Data Output**: NGS generates vast amounts of data, producing gigabases of sequence data in a single run. In contrast, Sanger sequencing typically yields much smaller data sets, which can limit its application in large-scale studies.\n\n5. **Applications**: While Sanger sequencing is still preferred for applications requiring high accuracy, such as validating NGS results or sequencing small regions of DNA, NGS is more suited for comprehensive analyses, including whole-genome sequencing, targeted resequencing, and transcriptome sequencing.\n\n6. **Technological Advancements**: NGS encompasses various platforms and methods, such as Pyrosequencing and Reversible-dye terminator sequencing, which have evolved to improve efficiency and accuracy. In contrast, Sanger sequencing has remained relatively unchanged since its inception.\n\nIn summary, NGS represents a significant advancement over traditional sequencing methods like Sanger sequencing, offering higher throughput, lower costs, greater sensitivity, and the ability to generate large volumes of data, making it a transformative tool in genomics research.
