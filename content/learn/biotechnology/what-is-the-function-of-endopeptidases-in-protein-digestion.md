    What is the function of endopeptidases in protein digestion?
answer: >-
    Endopeptidases play a crucial role in protein digestion by cleaving peptide bonds within the protein chain, rather than at the terminal ends. This action results in the formation of smaller peptide fragments, which is essential for the overall digestion process. \n\nFor instance, pepsin, an endopeptidase secreted in the stomach, initiates the breakdown of dietary proteins by targeting internal peptide bonds. This initial cleavage increases the surface area of the protein, making it more accessible for further digestion by exopeptidases, which remove amino acids from the ends of the peptide chains.\n\nThe process of protein digestion begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine, where various proteases, including endopeptidases like trypsin (produced in the pancreas), further break down polypeptides into smaller peptides and eventually into free amino acids. These free amino acids can then be absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nIn summary, endopeptidases are essential for initiating protein digestion and facilitating the subsequent actions of other digestive enzymes, ultimately leading to the absorption of amino acids.
