    What structural characteristic distinguishes prokaryotic cells from eukaryotic cells?
answer: >-
    The structural characteristic that distinguishes prokaryotic cells from eukaryotic cells is the absence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles in prokaryotic cells. \n\nProkaryotic cells, such as bacteria, have their genetic material (DNA) located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not enclosed by a membrane. In contrast, eukaryotic cells, which include plant and animal cells, have a well-defined nucleus that houses their DNA, along with various membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus.\n\nAdditionally, prokaryotic cells typically have a simpler structure, often characterized by a cell wall made of peptidoglycan (in bacteria), a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes. Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and more complex, with specialized structures that perform distinct functions within the cell. \n\nIn summary, the key distinguishing feature is that prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells possess these structures.
