    What is the net ATP yield from glycolysis?
answer: >-
    The net ATP yield from glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. During the glycolysis process, glucose is converted into pyruvate, and while a total of 4 ATP molecules are produced, 2 ATP molecules are consumed in the energy investment phase. Therefore, the net gain is:\n\n$$\n\text{Net ATP Yield} = \text{Total ATP Produced} - \text{ATP Consumed} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ ATP}\n$$\n\nIn addition to ATP, glycolysis also produces 2 NADH molecules, which can be further utilized in cellular respiration to generate more ATP in the presence of oxygen. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and does not require oxygen, making it an essential pathway for energy production in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
