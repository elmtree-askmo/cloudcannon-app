    Explain the volume range limitations of P10, P100, P200, and P1000 pipets.
answer: >-
    The volume range limitations for the P10, P100, P200, and P1000 pipets are as follows:\n\n1. **P10 Pipet**: This pipet is designed for very small volumes, typically ranging from **0.5 to 10 microliters**. It is ideal for applications requiring precise measurement of small liquid volumes, such as in molecular biology experiments.\n\n2. **P100 Pipet**: The P100 pipet can accurately measure volumes from **10 to 100 microliters**. This pipet is suitable for a variety of applications, including preparing dilutions and transferring small amounts of reagents.\n\n3. **P200 Pipet**: The volume range for the P200 pipet is **20 to 200 microliters**. It is commonly used in protocols that require moderate volume transfers, such as cell culture and enzyme assays.\n\n4. **P1000 Pipet**: This pipet is designed for larger volumes, with a range of **100 to 1000 microliters**. It is often used for transferring larger liquid volumes, such as in buffer preparation or when working with larger sample sizes.\n\nUsing a pipet outside its designated volume range can lead to inaccurate measurements and potential damage to the pipet. Therefore, it is crucial to select the appropriate pipet based on the volume requirements of your experiment.
