    What are the genetic markers associated with hereditary fructose intolerance?
answer: >-
    Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is primarily associated with mutations in the ALDOB gene, which encodes the enzyme aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of fructose, specifically in the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate. The ALDOB gene is located on chromosome 9 at the position 9q22.3.\n\nThe genetic markers associated with hereditary fructose intolerance include various pathogenic variants of the ALDOB gene. These mutations can lead to a deficiency in aldolase B, resulting in the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, which can cause cellular damage and a range of metabolic disturbances. The specific types of mutations can vary, including nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and deletions, which can affect the enzyme's function and stability.\n\nGenetic testing for mutations in the ALDOB gene is essential for diagnosing HFI, especially in individuals who present symptoms after the introduction of fructose into their diet. The identification of these genetic markers not only aids in diagnosis but also helps in understanding the inheritance pattern of the disorder, which is autosomal recessive.\n\nIn summary, the key genetic marker associated with hereditary fructose intolerance is the ALDOB gene, and mutations within this gene are responsible for the disorder's pathophysiology.
