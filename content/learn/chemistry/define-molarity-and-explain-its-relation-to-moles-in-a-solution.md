    Define molarity and explain its relation to moles in a solution.
answer: >-
    Molarity (M) is a crucial concept in chemistry that quantifies the concentration of a solute in a solution. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution and is expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L). The relationship between molarity and moles in a solution can be described using the following formula:\n\n$$\nM = \frac{n}{V}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ M $ is the molarity,\n- $ n $ is the number of moles of solute,\n- $ V $ is the volume of the solution in liters.\n\nFor example, if you dissolve 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) in enough water to make a total volume of 1 liter, the molarity of the solution would be 1 M. Conversely, if you were to dissolve the same amount of NaCl in only 0.5 liters of water, the molarity would increase to 2 M, as the concentration of solute increases when the volume of the solution decreases.\n\nMolarity is particularly important in chemical reactions, as it allows chemists to calculate the amounts of reactants and products involved in a reaction, facilitating stoichiometric calculations and the preparation of solutions with precise concentrations.
