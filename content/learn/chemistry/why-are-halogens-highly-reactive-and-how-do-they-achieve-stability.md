    This content explains why halogens are highly reactive due to their electron configuration, specifically their seven valence electrons and the tendency to gain one more electron for stability, similar to noble gases.

    Why are halogens highly reactive, and how do they achieve stability?
answer: >-
    Halogens, which are located in Group 17 of the periodic table, are highly reactive due to their electron configuration. They possess seven valence electrons, which means they are just one electron short of achieving a full outer shell, similar to the stable electron configuration of noble gases. This configuration is energetically favorable, leading halogens to seek out reactions that allow them to gain that one additional electron.\n\nWhen halogens react, they typically form anions by gaining an electron, resulting in a -1 charge. For example, chlorine (Cl) can gain an electron to become Cl‚Åª, achieving an electron configuration similar to that of the noble gas argon. This tendency to gain an electron is what makes halogens particularly reactive, especially with alkali metals, which have one valence electron and readily lose it to achieve a stable configuration.\n\nIn summary, halogens achieve stability by gaining one electron to complete their outer shell, which is the primary reason for their high reactivity. This behavior is a direct consequence of their valence electron configuration and the drive to attain a noble gas-like stability.
