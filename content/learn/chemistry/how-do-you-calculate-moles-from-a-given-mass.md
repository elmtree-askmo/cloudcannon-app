    How do you calculate moles from a given mass?
answer: >-
    To calculate moles from a given mass, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass of substance}}{\text{Molar mass}}\n$$\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform this calculation:\n\n1. **Determine the Mass**: Measure the mass of the substance you have in grams (g).\n\n2. **Find the Molar Mass**: Look up the molar mass of the substance, which is typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). The molar mass can be found on the periodic table or calculated by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in the chemical formula of the substance.\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Plug the values into the formula. For example, if you have 95 grams of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and the molar mass of MnO₂ is approximately 86.94 g/mol, the calculation would be:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Moles of MnO}_2 = \frac{95 \text{ g}}{86.94 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 1.09 \text{ moles}\n   $$\n\n4. **Interpret the Result**: The result gives you the number of moles of the substance present in the given mass.\n\nThis method is widely used in chemistry to convert between mass and moles, which is essential for stoichiometric calculations in chemical reactions.
