    How does the luster of metals differ from that of non-metals and metalloids?
answer: >-
    The luster of metals, non-metals, and metalloids varies significantly due to their distinct physical properties.\n\n1. **Metals**: Metals are characterized by a shiny, metallic luster. This shininess is a result of their ability to reflect light effectively. The surface of metals allows most incident light to be re-emitted, which creates the bright appearance commonly associated with metals like gold, silver, and copper. Additionally, metals are typically malleable and ductile, meaning they can be shaped into thin sheets or drawn into wires without breaking, which further enhances their shiny appearance when polished.\n\n2. **Non-Metals**: In contrast, non-metals generally do not exhibit a metallic luster. They often have a dull appearance, with many non-metals being non-lustrous and presenting various colors. The only exceptions are certain forms of non-metals, such as iodine and graphite, which can have a shiny surface. Non-metals are typically brittle and cannot be shaped like metals; they break when subjected to stress rather than deforming.\n\n3. **Metalloids**: Metalloids possess properties that are intermediate between metals and non-metals. They can exhibit a shiny or dull appearance, but many metalloids have a metallic luster. For example, some forms of selenium can display a striking sheen. Metalloids are generally brittle and often act as semiconductors, which means they can conduct electricity better than non-metals but not as well as metals.\n\nIn summary, metals are shiny and reflective, non-metals are typically dull and non-lustrous, and metalloids can vary but often have a metallic luster. This distinction is crucial in identifying and classifying elements based on their physical properties.
