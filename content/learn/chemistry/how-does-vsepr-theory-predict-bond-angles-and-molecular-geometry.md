    How does VSEPR theory predict bond angles and molecular geometry?
answer: >-
    VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory is a widely used model in chemistry that helps predict the three-dimensional shape of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs surrounding a central atom. The fundamental principle of VSEPR theory is that electron pairs, whether they are bonding pairs (shared between atoms) or lone pairs (non-bonding), will arrange themselves in a way that minimizes repulsion, leading to specific molecular geometries and bond angles.\n\n### Key Concepts of VSEPR Theory:\n\n1. **Electron Pair Geometry**: The arrangement of all electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) around the central atom determines the electron pair geometry. For example:\n   - **Linear**: 2 electron pairs (e.g., CO₂) with a bond angle of 180°.\n   - **Trigonal Planar**: 3 electron pairs (e.g., BF₃) with bond angles of 120°.\n   - **Tetrahedral**: 4 electron pairs (e.g., CH₄) with bond angles of approximately 109.5°.\n   - **Trigonal Bipyramidal**: 5 electron pairs (e.g., PCl₅) with bond angles of 90° and 120°.\n   - **Octahedral**: 6 electron pairs (e.g., SF₆) with bond angles of 90°.\n\n2. **Lone Pairs and Bond Angles**: Lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs, which can distort the bond angles. For instance, in water (H₂O), the presence of two lone pairs on the oxygen atom compresses the H-O-H bond angle to about 104.5°, rather than the expected 109.5° for a tetrahedral arrangement.\n\n3. **Predicting Molecular Geometry**: To predict the molecular geometry using VSEPR theory, one must first draw the Lewis structure of the molecule to identify the number of bonding and lone pairs around the central atom. The arrangement of these pairs will dictate the molecular shape. For example:\n   - **Methane (CH₄)** has four bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry.\n   - **Beryllium fluoride (BeF₂)** has two bonding pairs and no lone pairs, leading to a linear geometry.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **BF₃**: The molecule has a trigonal planar geometry with F-B-F bond angles of 120°.\n   - **H₂O**: The molecular geometry is bent due to the two lone pairs on oxygen, resulting in a bond angle of 104.5°.\n\nIn summary, VSEPR theory provides a systematic approach to predicting molecular geometry and bond angles by considering the repulsion between electron pairs. This model is particularly useful for understanding the shapes of organic molecules and polyatomic ions, allowing chemists to visualize and predict the behavior of various compounds.
