    Define homogeneous mixtures and provide an example.
answer: >-
    Homogeneous mixtures are mixtures that have a uniform composition throughout, meaning that the individual components are not distinguishable from one another. In a homogeneous mixture, the different substances are evenly distributed, and any sample taken from the mixture will have the same composition as any other sample.\n\nAn example of a homogeneous mixture is saltwater. In this case, when salt (sodium chloride) is completely dissolved in water, it creates a uniform solution where the salt ions are evenly distributed throughout the water. This uniformity means that you cannot see the individual salt particles, and the solution appears as a single phase.\n\nOther examples of homogeneous mixtures include air (a mixture of gases), vinegar (a solution of acetic acid in water), and alloys like bronze (a mixture of copper and tin).
