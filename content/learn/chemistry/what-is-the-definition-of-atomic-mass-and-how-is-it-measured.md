    What is the definition of atomic mass and how is it measured?
answer: >-
    Atomic mass is defined as the mass of a specific atom, typically measured in atomic mass units (AMU). It reflects the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom. For instance, chlorine-35 has an atomic mass of 35 AMU, while chlorine-37 has an atomic mass of 37 AMU. The atomic mass is a specific value for each isotope of an element, as different isotopes have varying numbers of neutrons.\n\nAtomic mass is measured using mass spectrometry, a technique that allows for the precise determination of the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. In this process, atoms are ionized, and the resulting ions are accelerated in an electric field. Their trajectories are then analyzed to determine their mass, which is reported in AMU.\n\nIn summary, atomic mass is a fundamental property of individual atoms, crucial for understanding the behavior of elements and their isotopes in chemical reactions.
