    What are the key characteristics that define a spontaneous process?
answer: >-
    A spontaneous process is defined by several key characteristics:\n\n1. **Natural Tendency**: Spontaneous processes occur without the need for external energy input. They have a natural tendency to proceed in a specific direction under given conditions.\n\n2. **Entropy Increase**: One of the fundamental characteristics of spontaneous processes is that they are associated with an increase in the entropy of the universe. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. For example, the melting of ice at room temperature is spontaneous because it leads to an increase in entropy.\n\n3. **Independence from Speed**: Spontaneity does not imply that a process occurs quickly. Some spontaneous processes can take a long time to complete. For instance, the rusting of iron is a spontaneous process that occurs gradually over time without any external influence.\n\n4. **Thermodynamic Favorability**: The spontaneity of a reaction is often determined by changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS). A process is more likely to be spontaneous if it results in a decrease in enthalpy (exothermic) and an increase in entropy. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is a useful criterion for spontaneity, where a negative ΔG indicates a spontaneous process:\n   $$\n   \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S\n   $$\n   Here, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n5. **Examples of Spontaneous Processes**: Common examples include the melting of ice at room temperature, the diffusion of perfume in a room, and the combustion of hydrocarbons. Each of these processes occurs naturally and leads to an increase in the overall disorder of the system.\n\nIn summary, spontaneous processes are characterized by their natural occurrence without external energy, an increase in entropy, independence from the speed of occurrence, and thermodynamic favorability as indicated by changes in enthalpy and Gibbs free energy.
