answer: >-
    Ionization is the process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by adding or removing charged particles, typically electrons. This process can significantly affect the charge of particles, leading to the formation of cations and anions.\n\nWhen an atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion known as a cation. For example, when a neutral sodium atom (Na) loses an electron, it transforms into a sodium ion (Na+), which can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\text{Na}(s) \rightarrow \text{Na}^+(aq) + e^-\n$$\n\nConversely, when an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negatively charged ion known as an anion. For instance, when a chlorine atom (Cl) gains an electron, it becomes a chloride ion (Cl-). This process can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\text{Cl}(g) + e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}^-(aq)\n$$\n\nThe effects of ionization on the charge of particles are crucial in various chemical reactions and processes. Ions play essential roles in biological systems, such as nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. The presence of ions in solutions also affects the conductivity and reactivity of those solutions.\n\nMoreover, ionization requires energy, known as ionization energy (IE), which is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom in its gaseous state. This energy varies among different elements and is a critical factor in determining how easily an atom can form ions.\n\nIn summary, ionization alters the charge of particles by either adding or removing electrons, resulting in the formation of cations and anions, which are vital for numerous chemical and biological processes.
