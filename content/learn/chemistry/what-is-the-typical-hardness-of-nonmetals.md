    What is the typical hardness of non-metals?
answer: >-
    The typical hardness of non-metals varies significantly among different elements. Generally, non-metals are classified as either hard or soft. Most solid non-metals, such as sulfur and phosphorus, are relatively soft and can be easily broken or deformed. However, there are notable exceptions, with diamond, an allotropic form of carbon, being the hardest natural substance known. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Soft Non-Metals**: Elements like sulfur and phosphorus are soft and can be easily cut or shaped.\n- **Hard Non-Metals**: Diamond is an exception, being extremely hard and recognized as the hardest known natural material.\n\nThus, while many non-metals are soft, the hardness can vary widely, with diamond representing the extreme end of hardness among non-metals.
