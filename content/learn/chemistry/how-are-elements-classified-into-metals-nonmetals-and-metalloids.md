    How are elements classified into metals, non-metals, and metalloids?
answer: >-
    Elements are classified into three main categories: metals, non-metals, and metalloids. This classification is based on their shared physical and chemical properties, which can be observed in their behavior and characteristics.\n\n### Metals\nMetals are typically characterized by the following features:\n- **Luster**: They have a shiny appearance.\n- **Malleability and Ductility**: Metals can be hammered into thin sheets (malleable) and drawn into wires (ductile).\n- **Conductivity**: They are good conductors of heat and electricity.\n- **Oxides**: Metallic oxides are generally basic and ionic.\n- **Ionic Behavior**: Metals tend to lose electrons during chemical reactions, forming positive ions (cations).\n\nExamples of metals include sodium, potassium, iron, gold, and mercury.\n\n### Non-Metals\nNon-metals exhibit distinct properties that set them apart from metals:\n- **Appearance**: They are usually dull and lack the shiny luster of metals.\n- **Brittleness**: Non-metals are brittle when solid and cannot be shaped like metals.\n- **Conductivity**: They are poor conductors of heat and electricity.\n- **Oxides**: Non-metallic oxides are typically acidic.\n- **Ionic Behavior**: Non-metals tend to gain electrons during chemical reactions, forming negative ions (anions).\n\nExamples of non-metals include hydrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and iodine.\n\n### Metalloids\nMetalloids possess properties that are intermediate between metals and non-metals:\n- **Appearance**: They can appear metallic but are often brittle.\n- **Conductivity**: Metalloids are typically semiconductors, meaning they can conduct electricity better than non-metals but not as well as metals.\n- **Oxides**: Their oxides can exhibit both acidic and basic properties.\n\nExamples of metalloids include boron, silicon, arsenic, and antimony.\n\n### Summary\nThe classification of elements into metals, non-metals, and metalloids is essential for understanding their behavior in chemical reactions and their physical properties. This classification is visually represented in the periodic table, where metals are located on the left, non-metals on the right, and metalloids straddling the dividing line between the two.
