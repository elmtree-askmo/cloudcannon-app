    What are isotopes and what are their characteristics?
answer: >-
    Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons within their nuclei. This difference in neutron count results in varying atomic masses for the isotopes of a given element. Despite these differences, isotopes of the same element exhibit nearly identical chemical properties due to their shared atomic number, which determines their electron configuration and chemical behavior.\n\n### Characteristics of Isotopes:\n\n1. **Atomic Number and Mass Number**: All isotopes of an element have the same atomic number (the number of protons) but different mass numbers (the total number of protons and neutrons). For example, carbon has isotopes such as carbon-12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (6 protons and 8 neutrons).\n\n2. **Chemical Properties**: Isotopes of the same element behave similarly in chemical reactions because they have the same electron configuration. This means they participate in chemical bonding in the same way.\n\n3. **Physical Properties**: While isotopes share chemical properties, they can have different physical properties, such as density and rates of diffusion. For instance, heavier isotopes may react more slowly than their lighter counterparts in certain chemical reactions.\n\n4. **Stability**: Isotopes can be classified as stable or unstable (radioactive). Stable isotopes do not change over time, while unstable isotopes undergo radioactive decay, transforming into different elements or isotopes over time. For example, tritium (a hydrogen isotope) is radioactive and decays into helium.\n\n5. **Applications**: Isotopes have various applications in fields such as medicine (e.g., radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment), archaeology (carbon dating using carbon-14), and nuclear energy (uranium isotopes in reactors).\n\n6. **Notation**: Isotopes are typically denoted by the element's chemical symbol followed by the mass number. For example, carbon-14 is represented as $^{14}_{6}C$, where 14 is the mass number and 6 is the atomic number.\n\nIn summary, isotopes are essential in understanding atomic structure and have significant implications in both scientific research and practical applications across various fields.
