    Explain the difference between covalent and ionic bonds.
answer: >-
    Covalent and ionic bonds are two fundamental types of chemical bonds that differ primarily in how they handle electrons between atoms.\n\n### Covalent Bonds\nCovalent bonds are formed when two atoms share electrons to achieve a full valence shell, which is essential for stability. This sharing can occur in various ways:\n- **Single Covalent Bonds**: Involves the sharing of one pair of electrons (e.g., in hydrogen gas, H₂).\n- **Double Covalent Bonds**: Involves the sharing of two pairs of electrons (e.g., in oxygen gas, O₂).\n- **Triple Covalent Bonds**: Involves the sharing of three pairs of electrons (e.g., in nitrogen gas, N₂).\n\nCovalent bonds can be further classified into:\n- **Polar Covalent Bonds**: Electrons are shared unequally due to differences in electronegativity between the bonded atoms, resulting in partial charges (e.g., in water, H₂O).\n- **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: Electrons are shared equally, typically between atoms of the same element (e.g., in diatomic molecules like N₂).\n\n### Ionic Bonds\nIonic bonds, on the other hand, are formed through the **transfer of electrons** from one atom to another, typically between metals and non-metals. This process leads to the formation of ions:\n- A metal atom donates one or more electrons, becoming a positively charged ion (cation).\n- A non-metal atom accepts those electrons, becoming a negatively charged ion (anion).\n\nFor example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl). Sodium becomes Na⁺, and chlorine becomes Cl⁻. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Electron Interaction**:\n   - **Covalent Bonds**: Involve sharing of electrons.\n   - **Ionic Bonds**: Involve transfer of electrons.\n\n2. **Formation**:\n   - **Covalent Bonds**: Typically form between non-metals.\n   - **Ionic Bonds**: Typically form between metals and non-metals.\n\n3. **Properties**:\n   - **Covalent Compounds**: Generally have lower melting and boiling points, and may exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature.\n   - **Ionic Compounds**: Usually have high melting and boiling points and are solid at room temperature; they also tend to dissolve in water and conduct electricity when dissolved or molten.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between covalent and ionic bonds lies in the method of electron interaction—sharing versus transferring—which leads to different properties and behaviors of the resulting compounds.
