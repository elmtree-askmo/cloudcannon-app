    What are the common naming conventions for hydroxy acids?
answer: >-
    The common naming conventions for hydroxy acids primarily follow the guidelines set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Hydroxy acids are a subset of carboxylic acids that contain one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups in addition to the carboxyl (-COOH) group. Here are the key points regarding their nomenclature:\n\n1. **Basic Structure**: Hydroxy acids are named based on the longest carbon chain that includes the carboxyl group. The suffix "-anoic acid" is used to denote the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n2. **Hydroxy Group Prefix**: The presence of hydroxyl groups is indicated by the prefix "hydroxy." For example, if a hydroxy group is present on the second carbon of a carboxylic acid, the compound would be named as "2-hydroxy" followed by the name of the acid. \n\n3. **Positioning of Hydroxy Groups**: The position of the hydroxy group is indicated by a number that corresponds to its location on the carbon chain. For instance, "2-hydroxybutanoic acid" indicates that the hydroxy group is attached to the second carbon of butanoic acid.\n\n4. **Common Examples**: \n   - Lactic acid is systematically named as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, indicating a hydroxy group on the second carbon of the propanoic acid.\n   - Citric acid is known as 2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, reflecting its three carboxylic acid groups and one hydroxy group.\n\n5. **Beta-Hydroxy Acids**: A specific category of hydroxy acids, known as β-hydroxy acids, has the hydroxyl group attached to the β-position relative to the carboxyl group. An example is β-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n\n6. **Use of Greek Letters**: In common naming conventions, Greek letters (α, β, γ, etc.) are often used to denote the position of substituents relative to the carboxyl carbon, rather than numerical designations.\n\nThese conventions ensure that the names of hydroxy acids are systematic and provide clear information about their structure and functional groups.
