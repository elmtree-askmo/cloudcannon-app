    How do homogeneous mixtures differ from heterogeneous mixtures?
answer: >-
    Homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures differ primarily in their composition and the uniformity of their components.\n\n1. **Homogeneous Mixtures**: These mixtures have a uniform composition throughout. This means that the individual components are evenly distributed and cannot be easily distinguished from one another. A classic example of a homogeneous mixture is saltwater, where the salt (sodium chloride) dissolves completely in water, resulting in a solution that appears the same throughout. If you take samples from different parts of the solution, they will have the same ratio of salt to water.\n\n2. **Heterogeneous Mixtures**: In contrast, heterogeneous mixtures consist of distinct components that can be easily identified and separated. The individual substances retain their properties and are not uniformly distributed. An example of a heterogeneous mixture is a salad, where you can see and separate the different ingredients (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.). If you take samples from different parts of the salad, the composition will vary, and you may get more of one ingredient in one sample than in another.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the uniformity of composition: homogeneous mixtures are uniform and consistent throughout, while heterogeneous mixtures contain distinct, identifiable components that are not uniformly distributed. Both types of mixtures can be separated by physical means, such as filtration or distillation.
