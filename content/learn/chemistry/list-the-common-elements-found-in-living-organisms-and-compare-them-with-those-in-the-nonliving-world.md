    List the common elements found in living organisms and compare them with those in the non-living world.
answer: >-
    In living organisms, the most common elements are often summarized by the acronyms CHNOPS and CHON, which stand for:\n\n- **C**arbon (C)\n- **H**ydrogen (H)\n- **N**itrogen (N)\n- **O**xygen (O)\n- **P**hosphorus (P)\n- **S**ulfur (S)\n\nThese six elements make up approximately 97% of the mass of a human body and are fundamental to the structure and function of biological molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Specifically, carbon is the backbone of organic molecules, while hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur play critical roles in various biochemical processes.\n\nIn contrast, the non-living world contains a broader range of elements, with many being found in different proportions compared to living organisms. While elements like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are also present in non-living matter (e.g., in minerals, water, and gases), they are often accompanied by a variety of other elements such as:\n\n- **Calcium (Ca)**: Common in rocks and minerals, and essential for biological structures like bones.\n- **Iron (Fe)**: Found in minerals and is crucial for biological processes like oxygen transport in hemoglobin.\n- **Silicon (Si)**: Abundant in the Earth's crust and found in many minerals.\n\nSome elements that are common in living organisms, such as phosphorus and sulfur, may be relatively rare in the non-living world. For example, phosphorus is primarily found in phosphate rocks and is essential for DNA and ATP, while sulfur is found in minerals and is important for certain amino acids.\n\nOverall, while both living and non-living matter share some common elements, the specific proportions and combinations of these elements differ significantly, reflecting the unique biochemical requirements of life. The chemical reactions involving these elements obey the same physical and chemical laws, regardless of whether they are part of living or non-living systems.
