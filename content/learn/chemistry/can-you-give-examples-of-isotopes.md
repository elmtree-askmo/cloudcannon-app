    Can you give examples of isotopes?
answer: >-
    Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. Here are some examples of isotopes:\n\n1. **Hydrogen Isotopes**:\n   - **Protium (¹H)**: This is the most common isotope of hydrogen, with one proton and no neutrons.\n   - **Deuterium (²H)**: This isotope has one proton and one neutron.\n   - **Tritium (³H)**: A radioactive isotope of hydrogen, tritium has one proton and two neutrons.\n\n2. **Carbon Isotopes**:\n   - **Carbon-12 (¹²C)**: This is the most abundant isotope of carbon, with six protons and six neutrons.\n   - **Carbon-13 (¹³C)**: This stable isotope has six protons and seven neutrons.\n   - **Carbon-14 (¹⁴C)**: A radioactive isotope used in radiocarbon dating, it has six protons and eight neutrons.\n\n3. **Uranium Isotopes**:\n   - **Uranium-235 (²³⁵U)**: This isotope is used as fuel in nuclear reactors and has 92 protons and 143 neutrons.\n   - **Uranium-238 (²³⁸U)**: The most common isotope of uranium, it has 92 protons and 146 neutrons.\n\n4. **Other Examples**:\n   - **Oxygen Isotopes**: Oxygen has several isotopes, including oxygen-16 (¹⁶O), oxygen-17 (¹⁷O), and oxygen-18 (¹⁸O).\n   - **Chlorine Isotopes**: Chlorine has isotopes such as chlorine-35 (³⁵Cl) and chlorine-37 (³⁷Cl).\n   - **Lead Isotopes**: Lead has several isotopes, including lead-206 (²⁰⁶Pb), lead-207 (²⁰⁷Pb), and lead-208 (²⁰⁸Pb).\n\nThese isotopes can have different physical and chemical properties, and they play significant roles in various fields, including medicine, environmental science, and nuclear energy.
