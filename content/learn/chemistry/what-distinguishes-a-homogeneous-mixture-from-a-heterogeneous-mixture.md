    What distinguishes a homogeneous mixture from a heterogeneous mixture?
answer: >-
    The distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures lies primarily in the uniformity of their composition and the visibility of their components.\n\n1. **Homogeneous Mixtures**:\n   - **Definition**: Homogeneous mixtures have a uniform composition throughout. This means that the individual components are not distinguishable from one another.\n   - **Characteristics**: In a homogeneous mixture, the particles of the solute are evenly dispersed in the solvent, resulting in a consistent appearance. They cannot be separated by simple physical methods like filtration.\n   - **Examples**: Common examples include saltwater, where the salt is completely dissolved in water, and air, which is a mixture of gases that are uniformly mixed.\n\n2. **Heterogeneous Mixtures**:\n   - **Definition**: Heterogeneous mixtures consist of visibly different substances or phases. The components can be easily distinguished and separated by physical means.\n   - **Characteristics**: In a heterogeneous mixture, the different components can be seen and often retain their individual properties. For instance, the components may settle into layers or remain separate.\n   - **Examples**: Examples include salad, where individual ingredients like lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers can be seen, and oil and water, which do not mix and form distinct layers.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that homogeneous mixtures are uniform and indistinguishable, while heterogeneous mixtures are non-uniform and allow for the individual components to be seen and separated.
