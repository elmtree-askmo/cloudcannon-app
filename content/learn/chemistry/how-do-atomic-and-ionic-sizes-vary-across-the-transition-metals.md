    How do atomic and ionic sizes vary across the transition metals?
answer: >-
    The variation of atomic and ionic sizes across the transition metals exhibits distinct trends influenced by their electronic configurations and the effects of effective nuclear charge.\n\n1. **Atomic Size**: The atomic radii of transition metals generally decrease from group 3 to group 6. This trend is primarily due to the poor shielding effect provided by the relatively small number of d-electrons. As you move across the transition series, the effective nuclear charge increases, pulling the electrons closer to the nucleus and resulting in smaller atomic radii. However, the decrease in atomic size becomes less pronounced after reaching the midpoint of the series. For instance, the atomic size increases from nickel (Ni) to zinc (Zn), indicating that the trend is not uniform across all transition metals.\n\n2. **Ionic Size**: The ionic radii follow a similar trend to atomic radii. As transition metals lose electrons to form cations, their ionic size tends to decrease with increasing atomic number. This is particularly evident as the oxidation state of the metal increases; higher oxidation states correspond to smaller ionic sizes. The ionic radius is also influenced by the specific oxidation states of the metals, as different oxidation states can lead to variations in ionic size.\n\n3. **Lanthanide Contraction**: The phenomenon known as lanthanide contraction plays a significant role in the size variation between the 3d and 4d transition metals. The increase in size from 3d to 4d metals is more pronounced than from 4d to 5d metals due to the lanthanide contraction, which results from the ineffective shielding of the nuclear charge by the f-electrons in the lanthanides. This contraction leads to only a slight increase in ionic radius from Mo³⁺ to W³⁺, for example.\n\nIn summary, the atomic and ionic sizes of transition metals decrease across the series due to increasing effective nuclear charge and poor shielding by d-electrons, with notable exceptions and variations influenced by oxidation states and the lanthanide contraction.
