    How do you balance a chemical equation involving the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen?
answer: >-
    To balance a chemical equation involving the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, you need to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. This is essential for adhering to the law of conservation of mass.\n\nFor the reaction of hydrogen gas ($ \text{H}_2 $) with oxygen gas ($ \text{O}_2 $) to form water ($ \text{H}_2\text{O} $), the unbalanced equation is:\n\n$$\n\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Balance the Equation:\n\n1. **Count the Atoms**: \n   - On the left side (reactants), you have:\n     - 2 hydrogen atoms (from $ \text{H}_2 $)\n     - 2 oxygen atoms (from $ \text{O}_2 $)\n   - On the right side (products), you have:\n     - 2 hydrogen atoms (from $ \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n     - 1 oxygen atom (from $ \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n\n2. **Balance the Oxygen Atoms**: \n   - Since there are 2 oxygen atoms on the left and only 1 on the right, you need to adjust the coefficient of water. To balance the oxygen, you can place a coefficient of 2 in front of $ \text{H}_2\text{O} $:\n   \n   $$\n   \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n3. **Recount the Atoms**:\n   - Now, recalculate the number of atoms:\n     - Left side:\n       - 2 hydrogen atoms (from $ \text{H}_2 $)\n       - 2 oxygen atoms (from $ \text{O}_2 $)\n     - Right side:\n       - 4 hydrogen atoms (from $ 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n       - 2 oxygen atoms (from $ 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n\n4. **Balance the Hydrogen Atoms**:\n   - To balance the hydrogen atoms, you need to place a coefficient of 2 in front of $ \text{H}_2 $:\n   \n   $$\n   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Now, recount the atoms:\n     - Left side:\n       - 4 hydrogen atoms (from $ 2 \text{H}_2 $)\n       - 2 oxygen atoms (from $ \text{O}_2 $)\n     - Right side:\n       - 4 hydrogen atoms (from $ 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n       - 2 oxygen atoms (from $ 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} $)\n\nBoth sides now have the same number of each type of atom, confirming that the equation is balanced.\n\n### Final Balanced Equation:\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\nThis balanced equation indicates that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of liquid water.
