    What are the characteristics of acidic solutions in terms of pH and hydrogen ion concentration?
answer: >-
    Acidic solutions are characterized by specific properties related to their pH and hydrogen ion concentration. Here are the key characteristics:\n\n1. **pH Value**: Acidic solutions have a pH value less than 7. The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than one with a pH of 5.\n\n2. **Hydrogen Ion Concentration**: Acidic solutions contain a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) compared to hydroxide ions (OH⁻). The concentration of hydrogen ions can be expressed in molarity (mol/L). The relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n   $$\n   Rearranging this formula allows us to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration from the pH:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n   $$\n\n3. **Examples of Acidic Solutions**: Common examples of acidic solutions include lemon juice (with a pH around 2) and stomach acid, which is highly acidic. These solutions have significantly higher hydrogen ion concentrations compared to pure water, which has a pH of 7 and a hydrogen ion concentration of approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ mol/L.\n\n4. **Comparison with Neutral and Basic Solutions**: In contrast, basic (alkaline) solutions have a pH greater than 7 and a higher concentration of hydroxide ions than hydrogen ions. For instance, bleach has a pH around 12, indicating it is much less acidic than solutions like lemon juice.\n\nIn summary, acidic solutions are defined by their pH values below 7 and their higher hydrogen ion concentrations, which are critical for understanding their chemical behavior and interactions.
