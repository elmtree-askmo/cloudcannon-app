    What is the role of cohesion and adhesion in water's surface tension?
answer: >-
    Cohesion and adhesion play critical roles in water's surface tension, which is a fundamental property of water that allows it to resist external forces.\n\n### Cohesion\nCohesion refers to the attraction between molecules of the same substance. In water, this is primarily due to hydrogen bonding, which creates strong cohesive forces among water molecules. These cohesive forces are responsible for water's high surface tension, allowing it to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. This phenomenon is evident when water droplets form beads on surfaces, as the molecules at the surface are pulled inward by the hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. This high surface tension enables small insects, such as water striders, to walk on the surface of water without sinking.\n\n### Adhesion\nAdhesion, on the other hand, is the attraction between molecules of different substances. Water's ability to adhere to other polar surfaces, such as glass, is also a result of hydrogen bonding. This property is crucial for various processes, including capillary action, where water can move through narrow spaces against gravity. For instance, when water is placed in a graduated cylinder, it adheres to the glass, creating a meniscus. This interaction between adhesion and cohesion allows water to travel through plant xylem, facilitating the transport of nutrients and water from roots to leaves.\n\n### Surface Tension\nThe interplay between cohesion and adhesion contributes to surface tension. The cohesive forces among water molecules create a high surface tension, which allows the water surface to resist external forces. This is why objects that are denser than water, like a needle, can float on the surface if they do not break the surface tension. Additionally, the balance of cohesion and adhesion is essential for various biological processes, including the movement of water in plants and the formation of droplets.\n\nIn summary, cohesion provides water with its high surface tension, while adhesion allows water to interact with other materials, both of which are vital for numerous natural processes.
