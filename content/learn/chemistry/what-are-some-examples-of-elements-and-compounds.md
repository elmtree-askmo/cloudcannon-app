    What are some examples of elements and compounds?
answer: >-
    Elements and compounds are fundamental concepts in chemistry, each with distinct characteristics and examples.\n\n### Examples of Elements\nElements are pure substances that consist of only one type of atom. They cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Here are some examples of elements along with their chemical symbols:\n- **Carbon (C)**\n- **Iron (Fe)**\n- **Helium (He)**\n- **Hydrogen (H)**\n- **Oxygen (O)**\n- **Copper (Cu)**\n\n### Examples of Compounds\nCompounds are substances formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. The properties of compounds differ from those of the individual elements that compose them. Here are some examples of compounds along with their chemical formulas:\n- **Water (H₂O)**: Composed of hydrogen and oxygen.\n- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: Composed of carbon and oxygen.\n- **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**: Composed of hydrogen and chlorine.\n- **Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)**: Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n- **Table Salt (NaCl)**: Composed of sodium and chlorine.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, elements are the simplest forms of matter, represented by unique chemical symbols, while compounds are formed from the combination of two or more elements, resulting in substances with distinct properties. Understanding these differences is crucial in the study of chemistry and the classification of matter.
