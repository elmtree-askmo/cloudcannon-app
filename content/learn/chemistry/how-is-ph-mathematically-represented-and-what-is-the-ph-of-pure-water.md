    How is pH mathematically represented and what is the pH of pure water?
answer: >-
    The pH of a solution is mathematically represented as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration. The formula for calculating pH is given by:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]\n$$\n\nIn the case of pure water, at 25Â°C, the concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) is approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar. Using the pH formula, we can calculate the pH of pure water as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-7}) = 7\n$$\n\nThus, the pH of pure water is 7, which is considered neutral on the pH scale. This scale ranges from 0 to 14, where values below 7 indicate acidity and values above 7 indicate basicity.
