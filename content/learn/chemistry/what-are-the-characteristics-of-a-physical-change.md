    What are the characteristics of a physical change?
answer: >-
    A physical change is characterized by alterations in the physical properties of a substance without changing its chemical composition. Here are the key characteristics of a physical change:\n\n1. **Reversibility**: Many physical changes are reversible. For example, when ice melts into water, it can be frozen back into ice. However, not all physical changes are reversible, such as breaking a glass.\n\n2. **No Change in Chemical Composition**: During a physical change, the substance retains its chemical identity. For instance, when ice (solid water) melts, it becomes liquid water, but the chemical formula (Hâ‚‚O) remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Change in Physical Properties**: Physical changes can involve changes in various physical properties, such as state (solid, liquid, gas), shape, size, or appearance. For example, when sugar dissolves in water, the sugar molecules disperse, but the chemical structure of sugar remains intact.\n\n4. **Energy Changes**: Physical changes often involve energy changes, such as heat absorption or release. For example, melting ice absorbs heat from the environment, while freezing water releases heat.\n\n5. **Examples**: Common examples of physical changes include:\n   - Melting of ice into water\n   - Boiling of water into steam\n   - Dissolving salt in water\n   - Breaking a piece of chalk\n\nIn summary, physical changes are transformations that affect the form or appearance of a substance without altering its chemical identity.
