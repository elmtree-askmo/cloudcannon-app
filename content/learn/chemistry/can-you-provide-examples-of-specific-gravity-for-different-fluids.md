answer: >-
    Specific gravity is a dimensionless quantity that compares the density of a fluid to the density of water at a specific temperature (usually 4°C, where water has its maximum density of 1000 kg/m³). Here are some examples of specific gravity for various common fluids at approximately 25°C:\n\n1. **Water (pure)**: 1.000\n2. **Acetic Acid**: 1.052\n3. **Acetone**: 0.787\n4. **Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)**: 0.789\n5. **Methanol (methyl alcohol)**: 0.792\n6. **Benzene**: 0.874\n7. **Toluene**: 0.865\n8. **Turpentine**: 0.871\n9. **Olive Oil**: 0.910\n10. **Glycerin**: 1.261\n11. **Brine (saltwater)**: 1.212\n12. **Bromine**: 3.117\n\nThese values indicate that fluids with a specific gravity less than 1 will float in water, while those with a specific gravity greater than 1 will sink. Specific gravity is crucial in applications such as fluid separation, material selection, and analyzing buoyancy in various engineering and scientific contexts.
