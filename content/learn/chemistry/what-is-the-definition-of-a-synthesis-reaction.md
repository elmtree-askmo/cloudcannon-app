    What is the definition of a synthesis reaction?
answer: >-
    A synthesis reaction, also known as a direct combination reaction, is a type of chemical reaction in which two or more simple substances (elements or compounds) combine to form a more complex product, which is always a compound. The general form of a synthesis reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\nA + B \rightarrow AB\n$$\n\nIn this equation, A and B represent the reactants, while AB represents the product formed from their combination. Synthesis reactions are characterized by the formation of either ionic or covalent bonds, and they are often exothermic, meaning they release energy in the form of heat or light during the process.\n\nAn everyday example of a synthesis reaction is the formation of table salt (NaCl) from its constituent elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl):\n\n$$\n2Na + Cl_2 \rightarrow 2NaCl\n$$\n\nThis reaction illustrates how two reactants combine to create a single product, demonstrating the fundamental nature of synthesis reactions in chemistry.
