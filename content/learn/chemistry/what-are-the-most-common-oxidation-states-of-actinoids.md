    What are the most common oxidation states of actinoids?
answer: >-
    The actinoids, which include elements from actinium (Ac) to lawrencium (Lr), exhibit a variety of oxidation states, with the most common being +3. This oxidation state is achieved by the loss of two 7s and one 5f or 6d electron. The general electronic configuration of actinoids can be represented as [Rn] 5f¹⁻¹⁴ 6d⁰⁻¹ 7s².\n\nIn addition to the +3 oxidation state, actinoids can also exhibit +2, +4, +5, +6, and +7 oxidation states. For instance, americium (Am) and thorium (Th) are known to form +2 oxidation states. The stability of the +3 oxidation state tends to increase with the atomic number of the actinoids, although it is not the most stable for the first four elements: thorium (Th), protactinium (Pa), uranium (U), and neptunium (Np).\n\nThe presence of multiple oxidation states in actinoids is attributed to the relatively small energy gap between the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals, allowing for greater variability in their chemical behavior. The lighter actinoids, such as thorium through plutonium, can also exhibit higher oxidation states (like +4, +5, and +6) which are more stable and often form compounds with low solubility.\n\nIn summary, the oxidation states of actinoids range from +2 to +7, with +3 being the most prevalent, reflecting their complex electronic structure and chemical reactivity.
