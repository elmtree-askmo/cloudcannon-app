    Provide an example of a compound and explain its chemical formula.
answer: >-
    An example of a compound is water, which has the chemical formula H₂O. This formula indicates that each molecule of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. \n\nThe chemical formula H₂O provides important information about the composition of the compound. The subscript "2" next to the hydrogen (H) signifies that there are two hydrogen atoms, while the absence of a subscript next to the oxygen (O) indicates that there is one oxygen atom in the molecule. \n\nWater is a classic example of a compound because its properties are distinct from those of its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen. For instance, hydrogen is a flammable gas, and oxygen supports combustion, but when these two elements combine to form water, the resulting compound is a liquid that is essential for life and does not support combustion. \n\nIn summary, the chemical formula H₂O not only represents the composition of water but also highlights the unique properties that arise from the chemical bonding of its constituent elements.
