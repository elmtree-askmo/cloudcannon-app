    How does adhesion contribute to capillary action in water?
answer: >-
    Adhesion plays a crucial role in capillary action, which is the ability of water to move through narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the interplay between adhesion and cohesion.\n\n1. **Adhesion**: This is the tendency of water molecules to stick to other substances. When water comes into contact with the walls of a narrow tube or a porous material (like a paper towel), the water molecules adhere to the surface due to attractive forces. For instance, in a paper towel, water molecules stick to the cellulose fibers, which facilitates the upward movement of water. This adhesion to the surface counteracts the force of gravity, allowing water to rise.\n\n2. **Cohesion**: While adhesion is responsible for the interaction between water and the surface, cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules themselves. This property allows water molecules to stick together, forming a continuous column of water that can be pulled upward as more water adheres to the surface.\n\n3. **Capillary Action**: The combination of adhesion and cohesion results in capillary action. For example, when a straw is placed in water, the adhesive forces between the water and the straw pull water up into the straw, while cohesive forces draw more water molecules along with it. This principle is essential for the transport of water in plants, where water moves through narrow xylem vessels against gravity.\n\nIn summary, adhesion contributes to capillary action by allowing water molecules to stick to surfaces, which, in conjunction with cohesion, enables water to rise in narrow spaces. This is vital for various biological processes, including the movement of water and nutrients in plants.
