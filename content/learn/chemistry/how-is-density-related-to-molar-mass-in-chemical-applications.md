    How is density related to molar mass in chemical applications?
answer: >-
    Density is fundamentally related to molar mass in chemical applications, particularly when dealing with gases. Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance, and it can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\text{Density} (\rho) = \frac{\text{Mass} (m)}{\text{Volume} (V)}\n$$\n\nIn the context of gases, the relationship between density and molar mass can be derived from the ideal gas law, which is given by the equation:\n\n$$\nPV = nRT\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $P$ is the pressure,\n- $V$ is the volume,\n- $n$ is the number of moles,\n- $R$ is the ideal gas constant,\n- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nBy substituting $n$ with $\frac{m}{M}$ (where $M$ is the molar mass), we can rearrange the ideal gas law to express density as:\n\n$$\nd = \frac{MP}{RT}\n$$\n\nHere, $d$ represents the density of the gas in g/L, $M$ is the molar mass in g/mol, $P$ is the pressure in atmospheres (atm), and $R$ is the gas law constant (approximately 0.0821 atm·L/(mol·K)).\n\nThis equation shows that the density of a gas is directly proportional to its molar mass. Therefore, a gas with a higher molar mass will have a higher density, while a gas with a lower molar mass will have a lower density. This principle is particularly useful in various chemical applications, such as calculating the density of gases under different conditions of temperature and pressure.\n\nFor example, if we want to calculate the density of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at a specific temperature and pressure, we can use the rearranged ideal gas law to find the density based on its molar mass and the given conditions.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between density and molar mass is crucial in understanding the behavior of gases and is widely applied in chemical calculations and experiments.
