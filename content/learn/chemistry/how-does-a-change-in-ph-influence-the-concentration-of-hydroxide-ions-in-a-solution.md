    How does a change in pH influence the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution?
answer: >-
    A change in pH significantly influences the concentration of hydroxide ions ($[\text{OH}^-]$) in a solution due to the inverse relationship between pH and pOH. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where a pH less than 7 indicates an acidic solution (higher concentration of hydronium ions, $[\text{H}^+]$), and a pH greater than 7 indicates a basic solution (higher concentration of hydroxide ions).\n\nThe relationship between pH and hydroxide ion concentration can be described using the following formulas:\n\n1. The pH of a solution is defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log_{10} [\text{H}^+]\n   $$\n\n2. The pOH of a solution is defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{pOH} = -\log_{10} [\text{OH}^-]\n   $$\n\n3. The relationship between pH and pOH is given by:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14\n   $$\n\nFrom these relationships, we can derive how a change in pH affects the concentration of hydroxide ions. For example, if the pH of a solution increases (becomes more basic), the pOH decreases, leading to an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions. Conversely, if the pH decreases (becomes more acidic), the pOH increases, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide ions.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider a solution with a pH of 10:\n- The pOH can be calculated as:\n  $$\n  \text{pOH} = 14 - \text{pH} = 14 - 10 = 4\n  $$\n- The concentration of hydroxide ions can then be calculated:\n  $$\n  [\text{OH}^-] = 10^{-\text{pOH}} = 10^{-4} \text{ mol/L} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ M}\n  $$\n\nIf the pH changes to 12:\n- The new pOH is:\n  $$\n  \text{pOH} = 14 - 12 = 2\n  $$\n- The new concentration of hydroxide ions is:\n  $$\n  [\text{OH}^-] = 10^{-2} \text{ mol/L} = 1 \times 10^{-2} \text{ M}\n  $$\n\nThis demonstrates that as the pH increases from 10 to 12, the concentration of hydroxide ions increases from $1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ M}$ to $1 \times 10^{-2} \text{ M}$.\n\nIn summary, a change in pH directly affects the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution, with higher pH values corresponding to higher concentrations of hydroxide ions and lower pH values corresponding to lower concentrations.
