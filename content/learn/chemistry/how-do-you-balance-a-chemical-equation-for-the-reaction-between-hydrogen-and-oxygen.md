    How do you balance a chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen?
answer: >-
    To balance the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, you need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. The unbalanced equation for the combustion of hydrogen gas with oxygen gas to form water is:\n\n$$\n\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Balance the Equation:\n\n1. **Count the Atoms**: \n   - On the left side (reactants), you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 2 (from H₂)\n     - Oxygen (O): 2 (from O₂)\n   - On the right side (products), you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 2 (from H₂O)\n     - Oxygen (O): 1 (from H₂O)\n\n2. **Balance the Oxygen Atoms**: \n   Since there are 2 oxygen atoms on the left and only 1 on the right, you need to adjust the coefficient of water (H₂O) to 2 to balance the oxygen:\n   $$\n   \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n3. **Recount the Atoms**:\n   - Now, on the right side, you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 4 (from 2 H₂O)\n     - Oxygen (O): 2 (from 2 H₂O)\n\n4. **Balance the Hydrogen Atoms**: \n   Now, you have 4 hydrogen atoms on the right and only 2 on the left. To balance the hydrogen, you need to adjust the coefficient of hydrogen gas (H₂) to 2:\n   $$\n   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Left side:\n     - Hydrogen: 4 (from 2 H₂)\n     - Oxygen: 2 (from O₂)\n   - Right side:\n     - Hydrogen: 4 (from 2 H₂O)\n     - Oxygen: 2 (from 2 H₂O)\n\nNow both sides have the same number of each type of atom, confirming that the equation is balanced.\n\n### Final Balanced Equation:\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\nThis balanced equation indicates that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of liquid water, adhering to the law of conservation of mass.
