    How do you balance a chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen?
answer: >-
    To balance the chemical equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, you need to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation. The unbalanced equation for the combustion of hydrogen gas with oxygen gas to form water is:\n\n$$\n\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Balance the Equation:\n\n1. **Count the Atoms**: \n   - On the left side (reactants), you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 2 (from H₂)\n     - Oxygen (O): 2 (from O₂)\n   - On the right side (products), you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 2 (from H₂O)\n     - Oxygen (O): 1 (from H₂O)\n\n2. **Balance the Oxygen Atoms**: \n   Since there are 2 oxygen atoms on the left and only 1 on the right, you need to adjust the coefficient of water (H₂O) on the right side. You can do this by placing a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂O:\n\n   $$\n   \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n3. **Recount the Atoms**:\n   - Now, on the right side, you have:\n     - Hydrogen (H): 4 (from 2 H₂O)\n     - Oxygen (O): 2 (from 2 H₂O)\n\n4. **Balance the Hydrogen Atoms**: \n   Now, you have 4 hydrogen atoms on the right side and only 2 on the left. To balance the hydrogen, place a coefficient of 2 in front of H₂ on the left side:\n\n   $$\n   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Left side:\n     - Hydrogen: 4 (from 2 H₂)\n     - Oxygen: 2 (from O₂)\n   - Right side:\n     - Hydrogen: 4 (from 2 H₂O)\n     - Oxygen: 2 (from 2 H₂O)\n\nNow both sides have the same number of atoms for each element, confirming that the equation is balanced.\n\n### Final Balanced Equation:\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\nThis balanced equation indicates that two molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of oxygen gas to produce two molecules of liquid water, adhering to the law of conservation of mass.
