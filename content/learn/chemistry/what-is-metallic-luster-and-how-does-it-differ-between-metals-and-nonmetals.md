    Metallic luster is a property of metals characterized by their shiny appearance due to surface light reflection, contrasting with non-metals which generally appear dull, except for certain cases like diamond.

    What is metallic luster and how does it differ between metals and non-metals?
answer: >-
    Metallic luster is an optical property characteristic of metals, which refers to their ability to reflect light from their surface, giving them a shiny appearance. This quality is due to the presence of loosely bound electrons in metals that can interact with light particles (photons) of various energies, resulting in the reflective surface that is typical of metals.\n\nIn contrast, non-metals generally do not exhibit metallic luster. Most non-metals appear dull or non-reflective, lacking the shiny surface associated with metals. However, there are exceptions; for example, carbon in the form of diamond is known for its lustrous appearance. Non-metals can also be found in various states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) at room temperature, while metals are typically solid.\n\nThe differences in luster between metals and non-metals can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Metals**: \n  - Exhibit a shiny, reflective surface (metallic luster).\n  - Are generally opaque and have a glittering appearance.\n  - Good conductors of heat and electricity.\n\n- **Non-Metals**: \n  - Typically lack luster and appear dull.\n  - Can be transparent or translucent, depending on the specific non-metal.\n  - Generally poor conductors of heat and electricity, with some exceptions like graphite.\n\nIn summary, metallic luster is a defining property of metals, while non-metals usually do not possess this characteristic, contributing to their distinct physical and chemical behaviors.
