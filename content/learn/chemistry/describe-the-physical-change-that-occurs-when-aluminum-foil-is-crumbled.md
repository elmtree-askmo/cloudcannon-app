    Describe the physical change that occurs when aluminum foil is crumbled.
answer: >-
    When aluminum foil is crumbled, a physical change occurs. This is characterized by the alteration of the foil's shape without changing its chemical composition. The aluminum foil remains aluminum, regardless of how it is manipulated. \n\nIn a physical change, the substance involved retains its identity and properties, even though its form may be altered. In this case, crumpling the foil results in a different configuration, but it does not transform into a different substance. The process can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Initial State**: Flat aluminum foil\n- **Change**: Crumbling the foil into a wad or various shapes\n- **Final State**: Crumbled aluminum foil\n\nSince the chemical structure of aluminum remains unchanged, this is classified as a physical change. Other examples of physical changes include melting, freezing, and evaporating, where the substance's state may change, but its chemical identity does not.
