    How do the melting and boiling points of metals generally compare to those of non-metals?
answer: >-
    The melting and boiling points of metals generally compare to those of non-metals in a significant way. Metals typically have high melting and boiling points, while non-metals tend to have lower melting and boiling points.\n\n1. **Metals**: Most metals are hard, shiny solids with high melting and boiling points. For example, metals like iron and copper have melting points above 1000°C. However, there are exceptions; some metals, such as cesium, gallium, mercury, rubidium, and tin, have relatively low melting points compared to other metals.\n\n2. **Non-Metals**: In contrast, non-metals are often softer and can exist in various states (solid, liquid, or gas) at room temperature. Most non-metals have low melting and boiling points. For instance, sulfur has a melting point of about 115°C, and many non-metals are gaseous at room temperature, such as oxygen and nitrogen. Notably, graphite and diamonds, which are forms of carbon, exhibit high melting points, but these are exceptions among non-metals.\n\nIn summary, while metals generally exhibit high melting and boiling points, non-metals are characterized by their lower melting and boiling points, with some exceptions in both categories. This distinction is a fundamental aspect of the properties of these two classes of elements.
