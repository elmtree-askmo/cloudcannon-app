    Can you provide examples of non-metals that conduct electricity?
answer: >-
    The primary example of a non-metal that conducts electricity is carbon, specifically in its allotrope form known as graphite. Graphite is an excellent conductor of electricity due to its unique structure, where each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in a planar hexagonal lattice, leaving one free valence electron per carbon atom. This free electron can move easily, allowing graphite to conduct electricity effectively.\n\nWhile most non-metals are generally poor conductors of electricity, graphite stands out as an exception. Other non-metals, such as sulfur and phosphorus, do not conduct electricity well, as their electrons are held tightly and do not allow for free movement necessary for electrical conductivity.\n\nIn summary, the main non-metal that conducts electricity is graphite, which is a form of carbon.
