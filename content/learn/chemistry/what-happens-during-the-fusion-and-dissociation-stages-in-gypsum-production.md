    What happens during the fusion and dissociation stages in gypsum production?
answer: >-
    During the production of gypsum, the fusion and dissociation stages are critical processes that involve the transformation of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO₄·2H₂O) into its various forms, particularly during calcination.\n\n1. **Dissociation Stage**: Gypsum undergoes a simple two-phase dissociation when it is dissolved in water. This process results in the formation of a solution of calcium sulfate. The solubility of gypsum is governed by solid-liquid equilibrium with its dissociated ions and water molecules. The dissociation can be represented as follows:\n\n   $$ \n   CaSO₄·2H₂O \rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + SO₄^{2-} + 2H₂O \n   $$\n\n   This equilibrium is essential for understanding how gypsum behaves in aqueous solutions, especially in industrial applications where predicting solubility in concentrated multi-component electrolyte systems can be challenging.\n\n2. **Fusion Stage (Calcination)**: The fusion stage primarily involves the thermal process of calcination, where gypsum is heated to convert it into hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O). The reaction can be expressed as:\n\n   $$\n   CaSO₄·2H₂O + \text{energy} \rightarrow CaSO₄·½H₂O + 1.5H₂O\n   $$\n\n   This process requires careful control of temperature and time to ensure the desired product is achieved. The hemihydrate form is crucial for various applications, including the production of gypsum boards and other construction materials.\n\nIn summary, during the gypsum production process, the dissociation stage involves the dissolution of gypsum into its ionic components, while the fusion stage (calcination) transforms gypsum into hemihydrate through the application of heat. Both stages are essential for producing high-quality gypsum products used in construction and other industries.
