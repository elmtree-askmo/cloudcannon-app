answer: >-
    **Atomic Weight: Definition and Calculation**\n\nAtomic weight is defined as the weighted average of the atomic masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element. This average takes into account the relative abundance of each isotope, which means that isotopes that are more prevalent in nature will have a greater impact on the atomic weight.\n\n**Calculation of Atomic Weight Using Weighted Average**\n\nTo calculate atomic weight, the following formula is used:\n\n$$\n\text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{(\text{mass of isotope 1} \times \text{abundance of isotope 1}) + (\text{mass of isotope 2} \times \text{abundance of isotope 2})}{100}\n$$\n\nIn this formula:\n- The mass of each isotope is multiplied by its relative abundance (expressed as a percentage).\n- The products of these multiplications are summed together.\n- The total is then divided by 100 to convert the percentage into a decimal format.\n\n**Example: Chlorine Isotopes**\n\nFor instance, chlorine has two stable isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. The natural abundance of these isotopes is approximately:\n- Chlorine-35: 75%\n- Chlorine-37: 25%\n\nUsing the atomic masses:\n- Chlorine-35: 35 AMU\n- Chlorine-37: 37 AMU\n\nThe calculation for chlorine's atomic weight would be:\n\n$$\n\text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{(35 \times 75) + (37 \times 25)}{100} = \frac{2625 + 925}{100} = \frac{3550}{100} = 35.5 \text{ AMU}\n$$\n\nThus, the atomic weight of chlorine is approximately 35.5 AMU, reflecting the weighted contributions of its isotopes based on their natural abundances.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnderstanding atomic weight is crucial in chemistry, particularly in fields like biochemistry and pharmacology, where precise measurements of elements are essential. The concept of weighted averages helps clarify how the atomic weight is derived from the isotopes present in nature, emphasizing the importance of isotope abundance in determining the average mass of an element.
