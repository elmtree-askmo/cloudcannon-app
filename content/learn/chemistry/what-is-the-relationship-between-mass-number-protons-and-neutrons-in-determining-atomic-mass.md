    What is the relationship between mass number, protons, and neutrons in determining atomic mass?
answer: >-
    The relationship between mass number, protons, and neutrons is fundamental in determining atomic mass. The mass number of an atom is defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. Since protons and neutrons are the primary contributors to an atom's mass, the mass number provides a rough estimate of the atomic mass.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Mass Number**: \n   - The mass number (often denoted as $ A $) is calculated as:\n     $$\n     A = Z + N\n     $$\n     where $ Z $ is the number of protons (atomic number) and $ N $ is the number of neutrons.\n\n2. **Protons and Neutrons**:\n   - Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus, and their number defines the element (atomic number).\n   - Neutrons are neutral particles that also reside in the nucleus. The number of neutrons can vary among isotopes of the same element, leading to different mass numbers.\n\n3. **Isotopes**:\n   - Isotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. For example, carbon has isotopes such as carbon-12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and carbon-13 (6 protons and 7 neutrons). This variation affects the atomic mass.\n\n4. **Atomic Mass**:\n   - Atomic mass is often expressed in atomic mass units (amu) and is calculated as the weighted average of the masses of an element's isotopes, taking into account their natural abundances. The formula for calculating atomic mass is:\n     $$\n     \text{Atomic Mass} = \sum ( \text{mass of isotope} \times \text{abundance of isotope} )\n     $$\n   - Electrons are not included in this calculation because their mass is negligible compared to that of protons and neutrons.\n\n5. **Calculation of Neutrons**:\n   - The number of neutrons in an atom can be calculated by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number:\n     $$\n     N = A - Z\n     $$\n\n### Example:\nFor carbon, which has an atomic number of 6:\n- Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (mass number = 12).\n- Carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons (mass number = 13).\n- The average atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12.011 amu, reflecting the natural abundance of its isotopes.\n\nIn summary, the mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons, is crucial for determining the atomic mass of an element, while the presence of isotopes introduces variations in atomic mass due to differing neutron counts.
