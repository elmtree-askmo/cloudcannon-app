    What are network covalent solids and what are their properties?
answer: >-
    Network covalent solids, also known as covalent network solids or giant covalent structures, are materials in which atoms are bonded together by a continuous network of covalent bonds. This extensive bonding results in unique physical and chemical properties that distinguish them from other types of solids.\n\n### Properties of Network Covalent Solids:\n\n1. **High Melting and Boiling Points**: Due to the strong covalent bonds that hold the atoms together, network covalent solids typically have very high melting and boiling points. A significant amount of energy is required to break these bonds, making them stable at high temperatures.\n\n2. **Hardness**: These solids are generally very hard and durable. For example, diamond, a well-known network covalent solid, is one of the hardest known materials due to its tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms, which are covalently bonded in a three-dimensional structure.\n\n3. **Poor Electrical Conductivity**: Network covalent solids do not conduct electricity well because they lack free-moving electrons. In materials like diamond and silicon dioxide (quartz), all electrons are involved in sigma bonds, leaving no delocalized electrons to facilitate electrical conductivity.\n\n4. **Insolubility**: Network covalent solids are typically insoluble in both polar and nonpolar solvents. The strong covalent bonds within the solid make it difficult for solvents to disrupt the structure.\n\n5. **Structural Diversity**: These solids can exhibit a variety of structures. For instance, while diamond has a three-dimensional network, graphite consists of two-dimensional sheets of carbon atoms that are held together by weaker van der Waals forces between the layers, allowing them to slide over one another.\n\n### Examples of Network Covalent Solids:\n- **Diamond**: Composed entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure, making it extremely hard.\n- **Silicon Dioxide (Quartz)**: Features a three-dimensional network of silicon and oxygen atoms.\n- **Silicon Carbide (SiC)**: Contains a tetrahedral arrangement of silicon and carbon atoms, contributing to its hardness.\n\nIn summary, network covalent solids are characterized by their strong covalent bonding, leading to high melting points, hardness, and poor electrical conductivity, with notable examples including diamond and silicon dioxide.
