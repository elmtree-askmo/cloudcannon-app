    What is the relationship between conductivity and concentration in ionic solutions?
answer: >-
    The relationship between conductivity and concentration in ionic solutions is a fundamental concept in electrochemistry. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions, which are responsible for conducting electricity. As the concentration of these ions increases, the conductivity of the solution also increases.\n\n1. **Ionic Dissociation**: When ionic compounds, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), are dissolved in water, they dissociate into cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻). The presence of these charged particles allows the solution to conduct electric current.\n\n2. **Direct Relationship**: The conductivity ($\kappa$) of an electrolyte solution is directly proportional to the concentration of ions in the solution. This means that as the concentration of the ionic species increases, the conductivity of the solution also increases. This relationship can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \kappa = \sum (c_i \cdot \lambda_i)\n   $$\n   where $c_i$ is the concentration of each ion and $\lambda_i$ is the molar conductivity of that ion.\n\n3. **Weak vs. Strong Electrolytes**: The extent of conductivity also depends on whether the electrolyte is a strong or weak electrolyte. Strong electrolytes, which fully dissociate in solution, will exhibit higher conductivity at a given concentration compared to weak electrolytes, which only partially dissociate. For example, a 0.1 M solution of NaCl will conduct electricity much better than a 0.1 M solution of mercury(II) chloride (HgCl₂), which only dissociates to a limited extent.\n\n4. **Kohlrausch's Law**: According to Kohlrausch's law, the total conductivity of an electrolyte solution is the sum of the individual conductivities of all migrating ions. This law is particularly applicable to strong electrolytes, which are fully dissociated in solution. It states that the equivalent conductivity at infinite dilution is equal to the sum of the conductances of the anions and cations.\n\n5. **Ion Mobility**: The mobility of ions also plays a crucial role in determining conductivity. Different ions have different mobilities, which can affect the overall conductivity of the solution. For instance, ions with higher mobility will contribute more significantly to the conductivity than those with lower mobility.\n\nIn summary, the conductivity of ionic solutions is closely related to the concentration of ions present. As the concentration increases, so does the conductivity, with the type of electrolyte and the mobility of the ions also influencing the overall conductivity of the solution.
