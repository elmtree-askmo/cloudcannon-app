    What are the defining characteristics of organic molecules?
answer: >-
    Organic molecules are defined by several key characteristics that distinguish them from inorganic compounds. Here are the defining characteristics of organic molecules:\n\n1. **Presence of Carbon**: Organic molecules primarily contain carbon (C) atoms. This is a fundamental criterion, as carbon's ability to form four covalent bonds allows for a vast diversity of structures and functions.\n\n2. **Covalent Bonds**: The atoms in organic molecules are primarily linked by covalent bonds, which involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. This bonding type contributes to the stability and complexity of organic compounds.\n\n3. **Hydrogen and Other Atoms**: In addition to carbon, organic molecules typically contain hydrogen (H) and often include other elements such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and halogens (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine). The combination of these elements contributes to the functional diversity of organic compounds.\n\n4. **Functional Groups**: Organic molecules often contain functional groupsâ€”specific groups of atoms that confer particular chemical properties and reactivity to the molecule. These groups play a crucial role in the behavior and interactions of organic compounds in biological systems.\n\n5. **Solubility**: Many organic compounds are more soluble in organic solvents (like benzene, ether, or alcohols) than in water, due to their non-polar nature. This characteristic affects their behavior in biological systems and their interactions with other molecules.\n\n6. **Complexity and Size**: Organic molecules are generally larger and more complex than inorganic molecules. They can form long chains or rings, leading to a variety of structural forms, including macromolecules like carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.\n\n7. **Chirality**: Many organic molecules exhibit chirality, meaning they can exist in two mirror-image forms (enantiomers) that have different properties, particularly in biological contexts. This characteristic is significant in the function of biomolecules, such as amino acids and sugars.\n\n8. **Volatility**: Some organic compounds are volatile, meaning they can evaporate at relatively low temperatures. This property is important in various biological and environmental processes.\n\nThese characteristics collectively define organic molecules and underscore their essential roles in biochemistry and the functioning of living organisms.
