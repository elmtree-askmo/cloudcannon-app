    What are the common isotopes of hydrogen, and how do they differ in terms of proton and neutron presence?
answer: >-
    Hydrogen has three common isotopes, each differing in the number of neutrons present in their nuclei:\n\n1. **Protium (¹H)**: This is the most abundant isotope of hydrogen, consisting of one proton and no neutrons. Its atomic mass is approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu).\n\n2. **Deuterium (²H)**: This isotope contains one proton and one neutron, giving it an atomic mass of about 2 amu. Deuterium is less common than protium but is significant in various chemical and physical processes, including nuclear fusion.\n\n3. **Tritium (³H)**: Tritium has one proton and two neutrons, resulting in an atomic mass of approximately 3 amu. It is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12.3 years. Tritium is produced naturally in small amounts and can also be generated in nuclear reactors.\n\nThe differences in neutron count among these isotopes lead to variations in their physical and chemical properties, although they all behave similarly in chemical reactions due to having the same number of protons and electrons. In the context of auto-ionization of water and acidity, the most relevant isotope is protium, as it is the most prevalent form of hydrogen in nature.
