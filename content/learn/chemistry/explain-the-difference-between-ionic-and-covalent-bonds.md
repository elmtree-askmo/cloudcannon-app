    Explain the difference between ionic and covalent bonds.
answer: >-
    The difference between ionic and covalent bonds primarily revolves around how electrons are managed between the atoms involved in the bonding process.\n\n### Ionic Bonds\n- **Electron Transfer**: Ionic bonds are formed through the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. This typically occurs between metals and non-metals. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na) donates one electron to chlorine (Cl). This transfer results in sodium becoming a positively charged ion (Na⁺) and chlorine becoming a negatively charged ion (Cl⁻).\n- **Electrostatic Attraction**: The oppositely charged ions (cations and anions) are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction, which constitute the ionic bond. This type of bond emphasizes the creation of ions through electron transfer rather than sharing.\n\n### Covalent Bonds\n- **Electron Sharing**: In contrast, covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons to fill their valence shells. This sharing can occur in various forms, such as single, double, or triple bonds, depending on the number of shared electron pairs. For example, in a water molecule (H₂O), each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds.\n- **Types of Covalent Bonds**: The sharing of electrons can be equal (nonpolar covalent bonds) or unequal (polar covalent bonds), leading to partial charges in the case of polar covalent bonds. \n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the nature of electron interaction:\n- **Ionic Bonds**: Involve the transfer of electrons, resulting in the formation of charged ions.\n- **Covalent Bonds**: Involve the sharing of electrons between atoms.\n\nThis distinction is fundamental in understanding the behavior of different compounds and their properties in various chemical contexts.
