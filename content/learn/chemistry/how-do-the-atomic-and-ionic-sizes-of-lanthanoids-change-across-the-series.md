    The atomic and ionic sizes of lanthanoids decrease across the series from La to Lu due to increasing nuclear charge and ineffective shielding by the 4f electrons, resulting in the phenomenon known as lanthanoid contraction.

    How do the atomic and ionic sizes of lanthanoids change across the series?
answer: >-
    The atomic and ionic sizes of lanthanoids exhibit a consistent trend of decrease across the series, a phenomenon known as lanthanoid contraction. This contraction occurs as we move from lanthanum (La) to lutetium (Lu), which corresponds to atomic numbers 57 to 71.\n\n1. **Atomic Size**: As the atomic number increases from La to Lu, the atomic size decreases. This is primarily due to the increasing nuclear charge (the number of protons in the nucleus) which pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus. Although additional electrons are added, they enter the inner (n-2) f orbitals, which do not shield the nuclear charge effectively. Consequently, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons increases, leading to a reduction in atomic size.\n\n2. **Ionic Size**: The trend is similar for ionic radii, particularly for the tripositive lanthanide ions (Ln³⁺). The ionic radii decrease steadily from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺. This decrease is attributed to the same factors affecting atomic size: the poor shielding effect of the 4f electrons and the increasing effective nuclear charge. As a result, the ionic radii of these lanthanide ions show a smooth decrease across the series.\n\n3. **Lanthanoid Contraction**: The lanthanoid contraction is characterized by a greater-than-expected decrease in both atomic and ionic radii. This contraction is significant because it affects the properties of the lanthanides and the elements that follow them in the periodic table, leading to similarities in size between certain lanthanides and the post-lanthanoid elements (like hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten).\n\nIn summary, both atomic and ionic sizes of lanthanoids decrease from La to Lu due to the increasing nuclear charge and the ineffective shielding by the 4f electrons, resulting in the phenomenon known as lanthanoid contraction.
