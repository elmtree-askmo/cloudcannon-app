    Describe the atomic arrangement and type of bonds present in a water molecule.
answer: >-
    The atomic arrangement in a water molecule (H₂O) consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen (O) atom. This arrangement forms a V-shaped or bent molecular structure, with an angle of approximately 104.5 degrees between the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen atoms. \n\n### Types of Bonds in Water\n\n1. **Covalent Bonds**: \n   - In water, each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds. This sharing of electrons allows the atoms to achieve a more stable electronic configuration.\n   - The covalent bonds in water are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen is more electronegative, meaning it attracts the shared electrons more strongly than hydrogen. This unequal sharing results in a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms.\n\n2. **Hydrogen Bonds**: \n   - In addition to covalent bonds, water molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other. These are weak interactions that occur between the positively charged hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen atoms of another. Hydrogen bonding is crucial for many of water's unique properties, such as its high surface tension, boiling point, and solvent capabilities.\n\n### Summary\nThe molecular structure of water, characterized by its bent shape and polar covalent bonds, leads to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. This unique arrangement and bonding are fundamental to understanding water's behavior and its essential role in biological and chemical processes.
