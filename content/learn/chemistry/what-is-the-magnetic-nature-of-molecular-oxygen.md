    What is the magnetic nature of molecular oxygen?
answer: >-
    Molecular oxygen (\(O_2\)) is known to be paramagnetic, which means it is attracted to magnetic fields. This magnetic property arises from the presence of two unpaired electrons in its molecular structure. According to molecular orbital theory, these unpaired electrons occupy the antibonding molecular orbitals, specifically the $\pi^*$ orbitals (π* 2p_x and π* 2p_y).\n\nTo elaborate, the molecular orbital configuration of \(O_2\) can be described as follows:\n\n1. The two oxygen atoms combine their atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals.\n2. In the case of \(O_2\), the molecular orbitals are filled in the order of increasing energy, leading to the configuration: \n   - $\sigma_{2s}^2 \sigma_{2s}^*^2 \sigma_{2p_z}^2 \pi_{2p_x}^2 \pi_{2p_y}^2 \pi_{2p_x}^*^1 \pi_{2p_y}^*^1$.\n3. The two unpaired electrons in the $\pi^*$ orbitals contribute to the paramagnetic behavior of the molecule.\n\nThis paramagnetism is evidenced by experiments where liquid oxygen is attracted to a strong magnet, demonstrating its magnetic nature. In contrast, molecular nitrogen (\(N_2\)), which has all paired electrons, is diamagnetic and is repelled by magnetic fields.\n\nIn summary, the magnetic nature of molecular oxygen is a result of its two unpaired electrons, which allows it to be attracted to magnetic fields, confirming its classification as a paramagnetic substance.
