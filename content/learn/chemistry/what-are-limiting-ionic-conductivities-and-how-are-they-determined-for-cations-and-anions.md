    What are limiting ionic conductivities and how are they determined for cations and anions?
answer: >-
    Limiting ionic conductivities refer to the conductivities of individual ions in a solution when the concentration of the electrolyte approaches zero, or at infinite dilution. At this state, the ions are fully dissociated, and interactions between ions are minimal, allowing for a clearer measurement of their conductive properties.\n\nThe limiting ionic conductivities for cations and anions can be determined using Kohlrausch's Law, which states that the limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte (Λ°m) is the sum of the individual contributions of the limiting ionic conductivities of its constituent ions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\Lambda°_m = \lambda^+ + \lambda^-\n$$\n\nwhere $\lambda^+$ is the limiting ionic conductivity of the cation and $\lambda^-$ is the limiting ionic conductivity of the anion.\n\nFor example, the limiting ionic conductivities for silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) are given as $\lambda_{\text{Ag}^+} = 61.9 \, \text{S cm}^2 \text{mol}^{-1}$ and $\lambda_{\text{Cl}^-} = 76.3 \, \text{S cm}^2 \text{mol}^{-1}$, respectively. The total limiting molar conductivity of silver chloride (AgCl) can then be calculated as:\n\n$$\n\Lambda° = \lambda_{\text{Ag}^+} + \lambda_{\text{Cl}^-} = 138.2 \, \text{S cm}^2 \text{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nTo determine the limiting ionic conductivities of specific ions, one can also use extrapolated values from experimental data or compare the ionic conductivities of similar electrolytes. For instance, the limiting molar conductivity of magnesium chloride can be compared with that of potassium chloride to estimate the limiting ionic conductivity of magnesium ions.\n\nIn summary, limiting ionic conductivities are essential for understanding the conductive behavior of electrolytes in solution, and they can be determined through experimental measurements and the application of Kohlrausch's Law.
