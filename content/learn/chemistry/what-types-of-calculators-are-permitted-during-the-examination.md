    What types of calculators are permitted during the examination?
answer: >-
    During the Ministry of Education Fiji Year 12 Chemistry Examination 2023, students are permitted to use calculators that are silent, battery-operated, and non-programmable. Specifically, the use of scientific calculators such as the Casio fx-82MS is allowed, as well as other calculators with similar functions or those with only basic functions. However, calculators with features for retrieval of text or programmable functions are not permitted. This ensures that all candidates have a fair and standardized examination experience.
