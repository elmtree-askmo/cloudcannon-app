    What is molarity, and how is it calculated in the context of solution concentration?
answer: >-
    Molarity (M) is a key concept in chemistry that quantifies the concentration of a solute in a solution. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution and is expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L). \n\nTo calculate molarity, you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\nM = \frac{n}{V}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ M $ is the molarity,\n- $ n $ is the number of moles of solute,\n- $ V $ is the volume of the solution in liters.\n\nFor example, if you dissolve 1 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl) in enough water to make a total volume of 1 liter, the molarity of the solution would be 1 M. If you were to dissolve the same amount of NaCl in only 0.5 liters of water, the molarity would be 2 M, as the concentration of solute increases when the volume of the solution decreases.\n\nMolarity is particularly important in the context of acid-base chemistry, where it helps in determining the concentration of hydrogen ions (H‚Å∫) in a solution. For instance, in pure water at 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of hydrogen ions is approximately:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 1 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}\n$$\n\nThis concentration is crucial for calculating the pH of the solution, which is defined as:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]\n$$\n\nThus, understanding molarity allows chemists to accurately prepare solutions and predict the outcomes of chemical reactions based on the concentrations of reactants and products.
