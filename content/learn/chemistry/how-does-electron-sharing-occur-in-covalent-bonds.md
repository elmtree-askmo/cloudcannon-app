    How does electron sharing occur in covalent bonds?
answer: >-
    Electron sharing in covalent bonds occurs when two atoms come together to form a bond by sharing one or more pairs of electrons. This process allows each atom to achieve a more stable electron configuration, often resembling that of noble gases, which are known for their stability due to having full valence shells.\n\n### Mechanism of Electron Sharing\n\n1. **Formation of Covalent Bonds**: When two atoms approach each other, their outermost electron shells (valence shells) interact. If the atoms have similar electronegativities, they can share electrons rather than transferring them completely (as seen in ionic bonds). \n\n2. **Types of Covalent Bonds**:\n   - **Single Covalent Bonds**: In a single covalent bond, one pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. For example, in a water molecule (H₂O), each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds.\n   - **Double and Triple Covalent Bonds**: More than one pair of electrons can be shared between atoms. For instance, in an oxygen molecule (O₂), two oxygen atoms share two pairs of electrons, forming a double bond.\n\n3. **Electronegativity**: The tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons is quantified by electronegativity. When two atoms with different electronegativities form a bond, the electrons may be shared unequally, leading to polar covalent bonds. For example, in water, oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, resulting in a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4. **Stability and Molecular Formation**: The sharing of electrons allows atoms to fill their valence shells, leading to greater stability. This is crucial for the formation of various biological molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, which rely on covalent bonds for their structure and function.\n\nIn summary, electron sharing in covalent bonds is a fundamental concept in chemistry that enables the formation of stable molecules through the sharing of electron pairs, influenced by the electronegativity of the participating atoms.
