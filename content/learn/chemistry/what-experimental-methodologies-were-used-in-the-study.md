answer: >-
    The experimental methodologies used in the study of the phenolic composition of cherry wood and its impact on wine phenolics involved several key steps and techniques:\n\n1. **Sample Preparation**: The study utilized wood chips from various species, including cherry (Prunus avium), acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), and two types of oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica). These wood chips were added to a Portuguese red wine to evaluate their effects during a brief aging period.\n\n2. **Aging Process**: The red wine was aged for 90 days in contact with the wood chips. This aging process allowed for the extraction of phenolic compounds from the wood into the wine, facilitating the study of phenolic evolution.\n\n3. **Phenolic Analysis**: The researchers conducted analyses to quantify the phenolic compounds present in both the wood and the wine. More than 20 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in cherry wood, and the study focused on how these compounds influenced the wine's phenolic content and sensory profile.\n\n4. **Monitoring Changes**: The study monitored the evolution of global phenolic parameters and color intensity in the wine during the aging process. This included measuring total phenols, non-flavonoid phenols, and flavonoid phenols.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: A comparative analysis was performed between the effects of cherry wood and oak wood on the phenolic composition of the wine. This involved assessing the rate of oxidation of phenolics in the wine and identifying specific phenolic markers associated with the use of cherry wood.\n\n6. **Statistical Evaluation**: The data collected from the phenolic analyses were likely subjected to statistical evaluation to determine the significance of the differences observed between the various wood types and their impact on the wine.\n\nThese methodologies provided a comprehensive approach to understanding the influence of cherry wood on wine phenolics, allowing for insights into the sensory and chemical changes that occur during the aging process.
