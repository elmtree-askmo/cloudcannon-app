    This content explains how the removal of a reactant from a chemical equilibrium causes a leftward shift in the equilibrium position, as described by Le Chtelier's Principle, aiming to restore the concentration of the removed reactant.

    What happens to the equilibrium position when a reactant is removed?
answer: >-
    When a reactant is removed from a chemical system at equilibrium, the equilibrium position is disturbed. According to Le ChÃ¢telier's Principle, the system will respond to this disturbance by shifting the equilibrium to the left, which means it will favor the formation of the reactants. This shift occurs in order to increase the concentration of the reactant that was removed, thereby re-establishing equilibrium.\n\nThe principle can be summarized as follows: if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change (in this case, the removal of a reactant), the equilibrium will shift in a direction that counteracts that change. Specifically, removing a reactant decreases its concentration, creating an imbalance that the system seeks to correct by producing more of that reactant.\n\nFor example, consider a hypothetical reaction:\n\n$$\nA \rightleftharpoons B + C\n$$\n\nIf some amount of reactant A is removed, the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more A from the products B and C. This shift continues until a new equilibrium is established, with adjusted concentrations of A, B, and C.\n\nIn summary, the removal of a reactant leads to a leftward shift in the equilibrium position, as the system attempts to restore balance by increasing the concentration of the removed reactant.
