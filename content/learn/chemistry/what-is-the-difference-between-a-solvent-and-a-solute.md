    What is the difference between a solvent and a solute?
answer: >-
    The difference between a solvent and a solute is fundamental in the study of solutions in chemistry. \n\nA **solute** is the substance that is being dissolved in a solution. It is typically present in a lesser amount compared to the solvent. Solutes can exist in various forms, including solids, liquids, or gases. For example, in a solution of saltwater, sodium chloride (salt) is the solute.\n\nOn the other hand, a **solvent** is the medium in which the solute is dissolved. It is the component of the solution that is present in the greatest amount. Solvents are usually liquids, but they can also be gases or solids. In the saltwater example, water acts as the solvent.\n\nIn summary, the key distinctions are:\n- **Solute**: The substance being dissolved, present in a smaller quantity.\n- **Solvent**: The substance that dissolves the solute, present in a larger quantity.\n\nTogether, the solute and solvent form a homogeneous mixture known as a solution.
