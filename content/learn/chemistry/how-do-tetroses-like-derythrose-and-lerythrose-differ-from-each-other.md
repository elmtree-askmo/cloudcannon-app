    D-erythrose and L-erythrose are enantiomers that differ in the configuration of their chiral centers, specifically the orientation of their hydroxyl groups. They are diastereomers of D-threose and L-threose and have different chemical and physical properties.

    How do tetroses like D-erythrose and L-erythrose differ from each other?
answer: >-
    D-erythrose and L-erythrose are enantiomers, which means they are mirror images of each other and have the same chemical and physical properties, except for their interaction with chiral entities, such as other chiral molecules or polarized light. The distinction between the two is based on the configuration of their chiral centers.\n\nIn D-erythrose, the hydroxyl group on the bottom chiral carbon is positioned to the right, while in L-erythrose, it is positioned to the left. This difference in configuration at the chiral centers leads to their classification as enantiomers. \n\nAdditionally, both D-erythrose and L-erythrose are diastereomers of D-threose and L-threose, which means they are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties, unlike enantiomers, which share most properties except for their optical activity.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between D-erythrose and L-erythrose lies in the spatial arrangement of their atoms, specifically the orientation of the hydroxyl group on the bottom chiral carbon, which affects their interactions with other chiral substances.
