    How do energy changes occur in chemical reactions?
answer: >-
    Energy changes in chemical reactions occur primarily due to the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. When a reaction takes place, energy is either absorbed or released, which can be classified into two main categories: exothermic and endothermic reactions.\n\n1. **Exothermic Reactions**: In these reactions, energy is released into the surroundings, typically in the form of heat. This occurs when the energy released from forming new bonds is greater than the energy required to break the existing bonds. A common example of an exothermic reaction is combustion, where fuels react with oxygen to produce heat and light.\n\n2. **Endothermic Reactions**: Conversely, endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings. This happens when the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is greater than the energy released when new bonds are formed. Photosynthesis is a classic example of an endothermic reaction, where plants absorb sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nThe enthalpy change ($ \Delta H $) of a reaction quantifies the energy change and can be calculated using bond energy values. The process involves adding energy to break bonds (endothermic) and releasing energy when new bonds are formed (exothermic). The overall enthalpy change is determined by the difference between the total energy of the bonds broken and the total energy of the bonds formed.\n\nAdditionally, the pathway of a reaction can include higher energy intermediates, which may affect the overall energy change. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed, which underpins the energy changes observed in chemical reactions.\n\nIn summary, energy changes in chemical reactions are a result of the interplay between the energy required to break bonds and the energy released upon forming new bonds, leading to either an increase or decrease in the system's energy.
