    How is the enthalpy of formation defined and calculated?
answer: >-
    The standard enthalpy of formation, denoted as $ΔH^\circ_f$, is defined as the change in enthalpy that occurs when one mole of a pure substance is formed from its constituent elements in their most stable states under standard conditions (typically at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm). By convention, the standard enthalpy of formation for elements in their most stable form is defined as zero.\n\nTo calculate the standard enthalpy of formation for a reaction, the following formula is used:\n\n$$\nΔH^\circ_f = \sum v ΔH^\circ_f(\text{products}) - \sum v ΔH^\circ_f(\text{reactants})\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $v$ represents the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equation. This means that you sum the standard enthalpies of formation of the products, multiplied by their coefficients, and subtract the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants, also multiplied by their coefficients.\n\nFor example, the standard enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) can be represented by the reaction:\n\n$$\nC(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)\n$$\n\nThe enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated using the standard enthalpy values for the reactants and products involved. The standard enthalpy of formation for $CO_2$ at 298.15 K is approximately $ΔH_f^\circ = -393.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}$.\n\nThis method of calculating enthalpy changes is particularly useful in thermochemistry, as it allows for the prediction of enthalpy changes in reactions that may be difficult or dangerous to perform experimentally.
