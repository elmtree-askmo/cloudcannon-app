    Can you provide some common examples of chemical reactions?
answer: >-
    Here are some common examples of chemical reactions, categorized by their types:\n\n1. **Synthesis Reactions**: In a synthesis reaction, two or more reactants combine to form a single product. \n   - Example: The combination of iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide:\n     $$ \n     8 \text{Fe} + \text{S}_8 \rightarrow 8 \text{FeS} \n     $$\n\n2. **Decomposition Reactions**: A decomposition reaction occurs when a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler products.\n   - Example: The electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen:\n     $$ \n     2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \n     $$\n\n3. **Single Replacement Reactions**: In a single replacement reaction, one element replaces another in a compound.\n   - Example: Zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid:\n     $$ \n     \text{Zn} + 2 \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2 + \text{H}_2 \n     $$\n\n4. **Double Replacement Reactions**: In a double replacement reaction, the cations and anions of two different compounds exchange places to form two new compounds.\n   - Example: The reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate:\n     $$ \n     \text{NaCl} + \text{AgNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3 + \text{AgCl} \n     $$\n\n5. **Combustion Reactions**: A combustion reaction involves a fuel reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.\n   - Example: The combustion of propane:\n     $$ \n     \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3 \text{CO}_2 + 4 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy} \n     $$\n\n6. **Acid-Base Reactions**: These reactions typically involve the reaction of an acid with a base to produce a salt and water.\n   - Example: The reaction between baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and vinegar (acetic acid):\n     $$ \n     \text{NaHCO}_3 + \text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{NaC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2 \n     $$\n\n7. **Photosynthesis**: This is a natural process where plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight.\n   - Example:\n     $$ \n     6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2 \n     $$\n\nThese examples illustrate the various types of chemical reactions that occur in both everyday life and industrial processes. Each type of reaction has distinct characteristics and can be identified based on the changes in reactants and products.
