    How do heterogeneous mixtures differ from homogeneous mixtures?
answer: >-
    Heterogeneous mixtures and homogeneous mixtures differ primarily in their composition and appearance.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Heterogeneous Mixtures**: These consist of visibly different substances or phases. The components can be easily distinguished and separated by physical means. For example, in a salad, you can see and separate the individual ingredients, and in a mixture of oil and water, the two liquids do not mix and form distinct layers.\n   - **Homogeneous Mixtures**: These have a uniform composition throughout, meaning that the individual components are not distinguishable. They cannot be easily separated by physical means. Examples include saltwater, where the salt is completely dissolved in water, and air, which is a consistent mixture of gases.\n\n2. **Physical Appearance**:\n   - In heterogeneous mixtures, the different components are visually distinct, allowing for easy identification and separation. \n   - In homogeneous mixtures, the mixture appears uniform, and the individual components are not visible.\n\n3. **Separation Methods**:\n   - Components of heterogeneous mixtures can be separated using physical methods such as filtration or decanting.\n   - Homogeneous mixtures typically require more complex methods for separation, such as distillation or evaporation, since the components are not easily separable.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the uniformity of the mixture: heterogeneous mixtures have distinct, identifiable components, while homogeneous mixtures are uniform and indistinguishable.
