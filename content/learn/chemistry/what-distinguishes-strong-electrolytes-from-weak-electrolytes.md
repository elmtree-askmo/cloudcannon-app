    What distinguishes strong electrolytes from weak electrolytes?
answer: >-
    Strong electrolytes and weak electrolytes are distinguished primarily by their degree of ionization when dissolved in water.\n\n1. **Strong Electrolytes**: These substances fully dissociate into ions in an aqueous solution. This complete ionization results in a high concentration of free ions, which allows for efficient electrical conductivity. Common examples of strong electrolytes include soluble salts (like sodium chloride), strong acids (such as hydrochloric acid), and strong bases (like sodium hydroxide). The ionization of a strong acid, for instance, can be represented as follows:\n\n   $$ \n   HBr \rightarrow H^+ + Br^- \n   $$\n\n   Here, hydrobromic acid (HBr) completely dissociates into hydrogen ions (H⁺) and bromide ions (Br⁻).\n\n2. **Weak Electrolytes**: In contrast, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions when dissolved in water. This partial ionization results in a lower concentration of free ions, leading to less efficient electrical conductivity compared to strong electrolytes. Examples of weak electrolytes include weak acids (like acetic acid) and weak bases (like ammonia). The ionization of acetic acid can be represented as:\n\n   $$ \n   CH_3COOH \rightleftharpoons H^+ + CH_3COO^- \n   $$\n\n   In this case, acetic acid (CH₃COOH) only partially dissociates into hydrogen ions (H⁺) and acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nIn summary, the key distinction lies in the extent of ionization: strong electrolytes fully dissociate into ions, while weak electrolytes only partially dissociate. This difference in ionization affects their conductivity and overall behavior in solution.
