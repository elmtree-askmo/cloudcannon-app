    What are the three states of matter in which water can exist?
answer: >-
    Water can exist in three common states of matter: \n\n1. **Solid (Ice)**: At temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), water freezes and forms ice. In this state, water molecules are arranged in a crystalline structure, which makes ice less dense than liquid water, allowing it to float.\n\n2. **Liquid (Water)**: Between 0 degrees Celsius and 100 degrees Celsius (32 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit), water exists in its liquid state. In this form, water molecules are in constant motion, allowing them to flow and take the shape of their container.\n\n3. **Gas (Water Vapor)**: At temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), water boils and turns into water vapor, which is the gaseous state of water. In this state, water molecules are widely spaced and move freely.\n\nThe state of water is influenced by temperature and pressure, making it a unique substance that plays a crucial role in various natural processes.
