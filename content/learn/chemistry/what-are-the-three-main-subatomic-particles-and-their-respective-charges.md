    What are the three main subatomic particles and their respective charges?
answer: >-
    The three main subatomic particles that make up an atom are:\n\n1. **Protons**: \n   - Charge: Positive (+1)\n   - Location: Found in the nucleus of the atom.\n   - Significance: The number of protons in an atom defines its atomic number, which determines the identity of the element (e.g., hydrogen has one proton).\n\n2. **Neutrons**: \n   - Charge: Neutral (0)\n   - Location: Also located in the nucleus alongside protons.\n   - Significance: Neutrons contribute to the atomic mass of an element and can vary in number among isotopes of the same element.\n\n3. **Electrons**: \n   - Charge: Negative (-1)\n   - Location: Orbiting the nucleus in discrete energy levels or electron shells.\n   - Significance: The arrangement of electrons, especially the valence electrons in the outermost shell, influences how atoms bond and interact with one another.\n\nThese particles play a crucial role in the structure and behavior of atoms, which are the fundamental building blocks of matter.
