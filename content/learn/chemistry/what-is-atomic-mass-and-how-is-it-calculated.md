    What is atomic mass and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Atomic mass, also known as atomic weight, is a fundamental concept in chemistry that represents the mass of a single atom of an element. It is primarily derived from the combined mass of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, with minor contributions from the electrons and nuclear binding energy. The atomic mass is usually measured in unified atomic mass units (u) or daltons (Da), where 1 u is defined as 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 isotope.\n\n### Calculation of Atomic Mass\n\nThe atomic mass can be calculated using the following methods:\n\n1. **Mass Number Approximation**: For a rough estimate, the atomic mass can be approximated by adding the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. This is known as the mass number. For example, carbon has 6 protons and typically 6 neutrons, giving it a mass number of 12.\n\n2. **Weighted Average of Isotopes**: The atomic mass of an element is often calculated as a weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes, taking into account their relative abundances. The formula for calculating the average atomic mass is:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Mass} = \sum \left( \text{(fraction of isotope)} \times \text{(mass of isotope)} \right)\n   $$\n\n   For example, if an element has two isotopes, A and B, with masses $ m_A $ and $ m_B $ and relative abundances $ f_A $ and $ f_B $, the average atomic mass can be calculated as:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Average Atomic Mass} = (f_A \times m_A) + (f_B \times m_B)\n   $$\n\n3. **Periodic Table Reference**: The average atomic mass of an element can also be found directly on the periodic table, where it is listed for each element.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nFor instance, consider a sample of carbon that consists of 75% carbon-12 (mass = 12 u) and 25% carbon-14 (mass = 14 u). The average atomic mass can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the contribution from carbon-12:\n   $$ \n   0.75 \times 12 = 9 \n   $$\n\n2. Calculate the contribution from carbon-14:\n   $$ \n   0.25 \times 14 = 3.5 \n   $$\n\n3. Add the contributions:\n   $$ \n   \text{Average Atomic Mass} = 9 + 3.5 = 12.5 \, \text{u} \n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, atomic mass is a crucial concept in chemistry that reflects the average mass of an element's atoms, accounting for the contributions of protons, neutrons, and isotopic abundances. It is essential for stoichiometry, chemical reactions, and understanding the properties of elements.
