    What is the difference between sensitivity and precision in figures of merit?
answer: >-
    Sensitivity and precision are both important figures of merit used to evaluate the performance of analytical methods, but they refer to different aspects of measurement quality.\n\n### Sensitivity\nSensitivity refers to the ability of an analytical method to detect low concentrations of an analyte. It is a measure of how effectively a method can identify the presence of a substance, particularly at low levels. A highly sensitive method will produce a significant response (signal) even when the concentration of the analyte is very low. For example, in a chemical assay, sensitivity is crucial for detecting trace amounts of a substance, which is often expressed in terms of the limit of detection (LOD).\n\n### Precision\nPrecision, on the other hand, refers to the consistency or reproducibility of repeated measurements under the same conditions. It indicates how close the results of multiple measurements are to each other, regardless of whether they are close to the true value (accuracy). Precision is often assessed through statistical measures such as standard deviation or coefficient of variation. A method can be precise (i.e., yield similar results upon repeated testing) but not necessarily accurate if it consistently deviates from the true value.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while sensitivity focuses on the ability to detect low levels of an analyte, precision emphasizes the reproducibility of measurements. Both are critical for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of analytical methods, especially in fields such as forensic chemistry and quality control.
