    Can you provide examples of non-metals with high melting points?
answer: >-
    Examples of non-metals with high melting points include:\n\n1. **Carbon (Graphite)**: Graphite, an allotrope of carbon, has a melting point of approximately 3550 °C under high pressure. It is notable for its ability to conduct electricity and is used in various applications, including batteries and electrodes.\n\n2. **Diamond**: Another allotrope of carbon, diamond, has an extremely high melting point, estimated to be around 3550 °C as well. Diamonds are renowned for their hardness and are commonly used in cutting tools and jewelry.\n\nThese examples illustrate that while many non-metals tend to have lower melting points compared to metals, certain forms of carbon exhibit exceptionally high melting points, making them exceptions in the category of non-metals.
