    How does the hydrogen ion concentration in pure water compare to other solutions?
answer: >-
    The hydrogen ion concentration in pure water is a fundamental concept in understanding acidity and basicity in solutions. At 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) in pure water is approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar. This concentration arises from the auto-ionization of water, where water molecules dissociate into hydronium and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n\nWhen comparing the hydrogen ion concentration of pure water to other solutions, we observe significant differences:\n\n1. **Pure Water**: \n   - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M\n   - pH: 7 (neutral)\n\n2. **Orange Juice**: \n   - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: Approximately $1 \times 10^{-4}$ M\n   - pH: 4 (acidic)\n   - This indicates that orange juice is significantly more acidic than pure water, with a hydrogen ion concentration that is 1,000 times greater.\n\n3. **Bleach**: \n   - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: Approximately $1 \times 10^{-12}$ M\n   - pH: 12 (basic)\n   - Bleach is much more basic than pure water, with a hydrogen ion concentration that is 100,000 times lower.\n\n### Summary of Comparison:\n- **Acidic Solutions** (like orange juice) have a higher hydrogen ion concentration and lower pH values.\n- **Basic Solutions** (like bleach) have a lower hydrogen ion concentration and higher pH values.\n\nThe pH scale, which is logarithmic, allows for a more convenient representation of hydrogen ion concentration. The relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]\n$$\n\nThis means that each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration. Thus, understanding the hydrogen ion concentration in pure water compared to other solutions is crucial for grasping the concepts of acidity and basicity in chemistry.
