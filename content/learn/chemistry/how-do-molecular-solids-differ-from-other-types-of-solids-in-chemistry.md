    How do molecular solids differ from other types of solids in chemistry?
answer: >-
    Molecular solids differ from other types of solids in chemistry primarily in their composition, bonding, and resulting physical properties. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Composition**: Molecular solids are composed of neutral molecules, as opposed to ionic solids (which consist of ions), metallic solids (which consist of metal atoms), and covalent network solids (which consist of a network of covalently bonded atoms). Examples of molecular solids include ice (H₂O), sucrose (table sugar), and iodine (I₂).\n\n2. **Bonding**: The molecules in molecular solids are held together by relatively weak intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonds. This contrasts with ionic solids, which are held together by strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions, and metallic solids, which are held together by metallic bonding that allows for the delocalization of electrons.\n\n3. **Physical Properties**: Due to the weak intermolecular forces, molecular solids generally have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic and covalent network solids. For instance, many molecular solids can have melting points below −200 °C, while ionic solids typically have much higher melting points due to the strong ionic bonds. Additionally, molecular solids tend to be soft and easily compressible, whereas ionic and covalent solids are often hard and brittle.\n\n4. **Electrical Conductivity**: Molecular solids are generally non-conductors of electricity because their valence electrons are not free to move. In contrast, metallic solids can conduct electricity due to the presence of free-moving electrons.\n\n5. **Examples of Molecular Solids**: Common examples include small symmetrical molecules like H₂, N₂, O₂, and F₂, which form molecular solids with very low melting points. Larger nonpolar molecules, such as solid carbon dioxide (CO₂) and iodine (I₂), also exemplify molecular solids but with varying melting points due to differences in molecular size and intermolecular forces.\n\nIn summary, molecular solids are characterized by their composition of neutral molecules, weak intermolecular forces, lower melting and boiling points, and lack of electrical conductivity, setting them apart from other solid types in chemistry.
