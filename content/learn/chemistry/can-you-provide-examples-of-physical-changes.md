answer: >-
    Examples of physical changes are numerous and can be observed in everyday life. A physical change is defined as a change that affects one or more physical properties of a substance without altering its chemical composition. Here are some common examples:\n\n1. **Melting Ice**: When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid state, but the chemical composition (H₂O) remains the same.\n\n2. **Boiling Water**: Heating water causes it to change from a liquid to a gas (steam), yet it remains H₂O throughout the process.\n\n3. **Chopping Wood**: Cutting wood into smaller pieces alters its physical form but does not change its chemical structure.\n\n4. **Crumpling Paper**: When a sheet of paper is crumpled, its shape changes, but it is still paper with the same chemical properties.\n\n5. **Dissolving Sugar in Water**: When sugar dissolves, it disperses in water, but the sugar molecules remain unchanged.\n\n6. **Freezing Water**: Converting liquid water into ice is a physical change, as the water's chemical identity does not change.\n\n7. **Folding Origami**: The act of folding paper into different shapes is a physical change, as the paper's chemical composition remains intact.\n\nThese examples illustrate that physical changes can involve alterations in state, shape, or appearance, but they do not result in the formation of new substances.
