question: >-
    List three indicators of a chemical reaction.
answer: >-
    Three indicators of a chemical reaction include:\n\n1. **Color Change**: A noticeable change in color suggests that a new substance has formed, indicating a chemical reaction has occurred.\n\n2. **Gas Production**: The formation of gas, often observed as bubbling or fizzing, is a strong indicator of a chemical reaction taking place.\n\n3. **Temperature Change**: A reaction may either release heat (exothermic) or absorb heat (endothermic), leading to a change in temperature that can be detected.\n\nThese indicators help in identifying whether a chemical reaction has taken place.
