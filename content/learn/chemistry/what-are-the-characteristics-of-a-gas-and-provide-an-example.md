    What are the characteristics of a gas and provide an example.
answer: >-
    Gases exhibit several distinct characteristics that differentiate them from solids and liquids. Here are the key characteristics of gases:\n\n1. **Baja densidad (Low Density)**: Gases have a very low density due to the large separation between their molecules. This means that gases are much less dense compared to liquids and solids.\n\n2. **Compresibilidad (Compressibility)**: Gases are highly compressible, allowing them to be compressed into smaller volumes. This property arises because the molecules in a gas are far apart and can be pushed closer together when pressure is applied.\n\n3. **Expansión indefinida (Indefinite Expansion)**: Gases do not have a fixed volume or shape. They tend to expand to fill the entire volume of the container they occupy.\n\n4. **Difusividad alta (High Diffusivity)**: Gases mix uniformly with other gases and can diffuse quickly throughout a space. This is due to the rapid motion of gas molecules.\n\n5. **Variación de volumen con presión y temperatura (Volume Variation with Pressure and Temperature)**: The volume of a gas can change significantly with variations in pressure and temperature. According to the ideal gas law, the relationship between pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   PV = nRT\n   $$\n   where $ n $ is the number of moles of gas and $ R $ is the ideal gas constant.\n\n6. **Baja viscosidad (Low Viscosity)**: Gases have very low viscosity, which means they flow easily compared to liquids and solids.\n\n7. **Presión (Pressure)**: The pressure of a gas is defined as the force exerted by the gas per unit area. It depends on the amount of gas, temperature, and the volume of the container.\n\nAn example of a gas is **air**, which is a mixture of several gases, primarily nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂). Air occupies the volume of the container it is in and exhibits all the characteristics mentioned above.
