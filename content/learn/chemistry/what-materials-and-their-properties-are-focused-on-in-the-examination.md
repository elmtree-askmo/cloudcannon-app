    What materials and their properties are focused on in the examination?
answer: >-
    The Year 12 Chemistry Examination in Fiji focuses on various materials and their properties as part of its curriculum. Key areas of emphasis include:\n\n1. **Properties of Elements and Compounds**: Students are expected to understand the physical and chemical properties of different materials, including metals, non-metals, and compounds. This includes their reactivity, state of matter, and how these properties influence their use in everyday applications.\n\n2. **Materials Classification**: The examination covers the classification of materials based on their properties, such as conductors, insulators, and semiconductors. Understanding the differences between these categories is crucial for applications in technology and industry.\n\n3. **Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry**: Students will explore how materials interact during chemical reactions, including the formation of new substances and the conservation of mass. This includes calculations related to the amounts of reactants and products involved in reactions.\n\n4. **Consumer Chemistry**: The examination also addresses the properties of materials commonly found in consumer products. This includes understanding the chemical composition and safety of everyday items, such as cleaning agents, food additives, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n5. **Investigating Matter and Properties**: Students are encouraged to investigate the properties of various materials through experiments, which may include measuring physical properties like density, boiling point, and solubility.\n\nOverall, the examination aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of materials and their properties, preparing them for practical applications in both academic and real-world contexts.
