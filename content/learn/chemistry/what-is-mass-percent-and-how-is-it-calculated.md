answer: >-
    Mass percent, also known as mass percentage, is a way of expressing the concentration of an element in a compound as a percentage of the total mass of the compound. It provides a useful measure for understanding the composition of a chemical substance.\n\n### Calculation of Mass Percent\n\nThe mass percent of an element in a compound is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Mass percent} = \frac{\text{mass of element in 1 mole of compound}}{\text{molar mass of compound}} \times 100\%\n$$\n\n#### Example Calculation\n\nTo illustrate how to calculate mass percent, consider water (H₂O):\n\n1. **Determine the mass of the element in the compound**:\n   - Water contains 2 hydrogen (H) atoms. The atomic mass of hydrogen is approximately 1.01 g/mol.\n   - Therefore, the mass of hydrogen in 1 mole of water is:\n     $$ \n     \text{Mass of H} = 2 \times 1.01 \, \text{g/mol} = 2.02 \, \text{g} \n     $$\n\n2. **Calculate the molar mass of the compound**:\n   - The molar mass of water (H₂O) is calculated as follows:\n     - Molar mass of H₂O = (2 × 1.01 g/mol) + (16.00 g/mol for O) = 18.02 g/mol.\n\n3. **Calculate the mass percent of hydrogen**:\n   - Using the formula:\n     $$\n     \text{Mass percent of H} = \frac{2.02 \, \text{g}}{18.02 \, \text{g/mol}} \times 100\% \approx 11.2\%\n     $$\n\nThus, the mass percent of hydrogen in water is approximately 11.2%.\n\n### Importance of Mass Percent\n\nMass percent is particularly useful in various applications, including:\n\n- **Chemical Analysis**: It helps in determining the composition of compounds.\n- **Stoichiometry**: It is essential for calculations involving reactants and products in chemical reactions.\n- **Formulating Compounds**: It aids in the preparation of solutions and mixtures with specific concentrations.\n\nIn summary, mass percent is a fundamental concept in chemistry that quantifies the proportion of an element in a compound, allowing for better understanding and manipulation of chemical substances.
