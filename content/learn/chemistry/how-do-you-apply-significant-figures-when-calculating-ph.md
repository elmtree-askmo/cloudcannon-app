    When calculating pH and related hydrogen ion concentrations, applying significant figures is crucial to ensure that the precision of your results reflects the precision of your measurements. Hereâ€™s how to properly apply significant figures in pH calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding pH and Significant Figures**: The pH scale is logarithmic, and it is defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log[H^+]\n   $$\n   The number of decimal places in the pH value corresponds to the number of significant figures in the hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a pH of 3.67 has three significant figures.\n\n2. **Calculating Hydrogen Ion Concentration**: To find the hydrogen ion concentration from a given pH, you use the formula:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n   $$\n   For a pH of 3.67, you would substitute this value into the formula:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-3.67}\n   $$\n\n3. **Performing the Calculation**: When you calculate this, you get:\n   $$\n   [H^+] \approx 2.14 \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol/L}\n   $$\n   Here, the result is expressed with three significant figures, consistent with the pH measurement.\n\n4. **Reporting Results**: It is essential to report the hydrogen ion concentration with the same number of significant figures as the pH value. Therefore, if the pH is given as 3.67 (three significant figures), the resulting concentration should also be reported as:\n   $$\n   [H^+] \approx 2.14 \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol/L} \text{ (3 significant figures)}\n   $$\n\n5. **Importance of Significant Figures**: This practice ensures that the precision of your results is not overstated. If you were to report the concentration as 0.000215 mol/L (which has four significant figures), it would imply a greater precision than the original pH measurement allows.\n\nIn summary, when calculating pH and hydrogen ion concentrations, always match the number of significant figures in your results to the precision of the input data. This practice is fundamental in scientific calculations to maintain accuracy and reliability in your findings.
