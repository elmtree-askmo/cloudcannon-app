    How does temperature affect the equilibrium constant in a chemical reaction?
answer: >-
    Temperature has a significant effect on the equilibrium constant (K) of a chemical reaction, which is a measure of the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium. The relationship between temperature and the equilibrium constant is governed by the nature of the reaction—whether it is exothermic or endothermic.\n\n1. **Exothermic Reactions**: For reactions that release heat (exothermic), increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium position to the left, favoring the formation of reactants. This shift results in a decrease in the equilibrium constant (K). Conversely, decreasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of products and increasing K.\n\n   For example, consider the reaction:\n   $$\n   N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g) + Q\n   $$\n   Here, if the temperature is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the left, reducing the production of ammonia (NH₃).\n\n2. **Endothermic Reactions**: For reactions that absorb heat (endothermic), increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium position to the right, favoring the formation of products. This results in an increase in the equilibrium constant (K). Conversely, decreasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left, favoring the formation of reactants and decreasing K.\n\nIn summary, the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant can be summarized as follows:\n- **Exothermic Reaction**: Increase in temperature → Shift left (decrease K)\n- **Endothermic Reaction**: Increase in temperature → Shift right (increase K)\n\nThe relationship between Gibbs energy change (ΔG) and the equilibrium constant (K) is also relevant here, as it is given by the equation:\n$$\nΔG = -RT \ln(K)\n$$\nwhere R is the universal gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. This equation indicates that changes in temperature will affect the Gibbs energy and, consequently, the equilibrium constant.\n\nIn conclusion, temperature changes can significantly influence the equilibrium constant of a reaction, with the direction of the shift depending on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
