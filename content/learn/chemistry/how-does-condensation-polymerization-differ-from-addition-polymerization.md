    How does condensation polymerization differ from addition polymerization?
answer: >-
    Condensation polymerization and addition polymerization are two distinct methods used to synthesize polymers, each with unique characteristics and processes.\n\n### Addition Polymerization\n- **Process**: In addition polymerization, monomers with double or triple bonds (unsaturated monomers) are added together to form a polymer chain. This process does not involve the formation of any by-products; all atoms from the monomers are retained in the final polymer.\n- **Molecular Weight**: The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is an integral multiple of the monomer's molecular weight, as the polymer is formed directly from the monomers without any loss of atoms.\n- **Types of Polymers**: Addition polymerization typically results in homochain polymers, where the polymer consists of repeating units of the same type of monomer.\n- **Examples**: Common examples include polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n\n### Condensation Polymerization\n- **Process**: Condensation polymerization involves the reaction of two different monomers, each containing functional groups. During the reaction, small molecules such as water, ammonia, or hydrochloric acid are released as by-products. This process is characterized by the formation of covalent bonds between the monomers through the removal of these small molecules.\n- **Molecular Weight**: The molecular weight of the resulting polymer is not simply an integral multiple of the monomer's molecular weight due to the loss of atoms in the form of by-products.\n- **Types of Polymers**: Condensation polymerization typically results in heterochain polymers, which consist of different types of monomers linked together.\n- **Examples**: Notable examples include nylon, polyesters, and polyurethanes.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **By-products**: Addition polymerization does not produce by-products, while condensation polymerization results in the release of small molecules.\n2. **Monomer Types**: Addition polymerization generally involves unsaturated monomers, whereas condensation polymerization involves monomers with functional groups.\n3. **Polymer Structure**: Addition polymers are usually homochain, while condensation polymers are heterochain due to the involvement of different monomers.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between these two polymerization processes lies in the presence of by-products and the types of monomers involved, which ultimately affects the structure and properties of the resulting polymers.
