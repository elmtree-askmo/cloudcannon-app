    Provide an example calculation for determining hydroxide ion concentration from pH.
answer: >-
    To calculate the hydroxide ion concentration $[OH^-]$ from a given pH, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use the relationship between pH and pOH**: At 25Â°C, the sum of pH and pOH is always 14. This can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   pH + pOH = 14\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate pOH**: Rearranging the equation gives:\n   $$\n   pOH = 14 - pH\n   $$\n\n3. **Convert pOH to hydroxide ion concentration**: The hydroxide ion concentration can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   [OH^-] = 10^{-pOH}\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's say we have a solution with a pH of 11.6. We can calculate the hydroxide ion concentration as follows:\n\n1. **Calculate pOH**:\n   $$\n   pOH = 14 - 11.6 = 2.4\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate $[OH^-]$**:\n   $$\n   [OH^-] = 10^{-pOH} = 10^{-2.4} \approx 0.0040 \, \text{M}\n   $$\n\nThus, the hydroxide ion concentration $[OH^-]$ in a solution with a pH of 11.6 is approximately 0.0040 M.
