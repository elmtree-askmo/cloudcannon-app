    What is the method for calculating molar mass and why is it important?
answer: >-
    To calculate molar mass, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Chemical Formula**: Determine the molecular formula of the substance for which you want to calculate the molar mass. For example, the molecular formula of water is H₂O.\n\n2. **Find Atomic Masses**: Look up the atomic masses of each element in the formula from the periodic table. For instance:\n   - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.01 g/mol.\n   - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\n3. **Multiply by Subscripts**: Multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of times that element appears in the formula (the subscript). For water (H₂O):\n   - For hydrogen: $2 \times 1.01 \, \text{g/mol} = 2.02 \, \text{g/mol}$\n   - For oxygen: $1 \times 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 16.00 \, \text{g/mol}$\n\n4. **Sum the Masses**: Add the total masses of all elements together to get the molar mass of the compound:\n   $$\n   \text{Molar mass of H₂O} = 2.02 \, \text{g/mol} + 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} = 18.02 \, \text{g/mol}\n   $$\n\n### Importance of Molar Mass\n\nMolar mass is crucial in chemistry for several reasons:\n\n- **Stoichiometry**: It allows chemists to convert between grams and moles, which is essential for stoichiometric calculations in chemical reactions. Knowing the molar mass helps in determining how much of a reactant is needed or how much product will be formed.\n\n- **Chemical Reactions**: Molar mass is used to balance chemical equations and to calculate the yield of reactions. It ensures that the law of conservation of mass is upheld, as the total mass of reactants must equal the total mass of products.\n\n- **Solution Preparation**: In preparing solutions, molar mass is used to calculate the amount of solute needed to achieve a desired concentration.\n\n- **Understanding Properties**: Molar mass can influence the physical and chemical properties of substances, such as boiling point, melting point, and solubility.\n\nIn summary, calculating molar mass is a fundamental skill in chemistry that facilitates a wide range of applications, from laboratory work to theoretical calculations.
