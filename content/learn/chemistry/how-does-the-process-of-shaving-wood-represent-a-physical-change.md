    How does the process of shaving wood represent a physical change?
answer: >-
    The process of shaving wood is an excellent example of a physical change. In this process, when you use a knife to shave off pieces of wood from a stick or log, the wood retains its chemical composition throughout the action. The wood is still wood, and its chemical formula remains unchanged, which is typically represented as a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.\n\nPhysical changes are characterized by alterations in the form, shape, or appearance of a substance without any change in its chemical identity. In the case of shaving wood, the wood is simply being transformed into smaller pieces, but no new substances are formed. This is in contrast to chemical changes, where the original substances undergo a transformation that results in new chemical products.\n\nFor example, if you were to burn the wood, that would be a chemical change because it would produce new substances such as carbon dioxide and ash, fundamentally altering the chemical composition of the original wood.\n\nIn summary, shaving wood is a physical change because it involves a change in size and shape while maintaining the original chemical identity of the wood.
