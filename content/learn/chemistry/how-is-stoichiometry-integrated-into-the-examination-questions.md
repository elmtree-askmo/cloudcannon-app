    How is stoichiometry integrated into the examination questions?
answer: >-
    Stoichiometry is integrated into the Year 12 Chemistry Examination in Fiji through various questions that require students to perform calculations related to chemical reactions. These questions often involve determining the relationships between reactants and products in a chemical equation, which is a fundamental aspect of stoichiometry.\n\nFor instance, students may be asked to balance chemical equations and then use the balanced equations to calculate the amounts of reactants needed or the amounts of products formed. This could include problems where students analyze experimental data, such as the mass of a hydrated solid before and after heating, to determine the mass of water lost and subsequently apply stoichiometric principles to find the molar ratios involved.\n\nAdditionally, the examination structure emphasizes showing all working steps in calculations, which is crucial for demonstrating understanding in stoichiometry. This approach not only tests students' ability to perform calculations but also their comprehension of the underlying chemical principles that govern these relationships.\n\nOverall, stoichiometry is a key component of the examination, reflecting its importance in understanding chemical reactions and their quantitative aspects.
