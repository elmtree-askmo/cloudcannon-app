    How do chemical compounds form and what do they contain?
answer: >-
    Chemical compounds form when atoms of two or more different elements join together through strong forces known as chemical bonds. These bonds arise from the attractive electrostatic interactions between the atoms, which are stronger than the repulsive forces that also exist between them. The types of chemical bonds that primarily hold these atoms together are ionic and covalent bonds.\n\n1. **Ionic Bonds**: These typically form between metals and nonmetals. In an ionic bond, one atom donates an electron to another, resulting in the formation of charged ions. For example, sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl), creating Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, which are then held together by the electrostatic attraction between opposite charges.\n\n2. **Covalent Bonds**: These bonds occur when two nonmetals share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In a covalent bond, the atoms are bonded tightly together in molecules, which behave as single units. For instance, in a water molecule (H₂O), two hydrogen atoms share electrons with one oxygen atom.\n\nThe composition of a chemical compound is defined by its chemical formula, which specifies the types and ratios of the elements present. For example, the formula for water, H₂O, indicates that each molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The arrangement and ratio of these atoms are crucial for determining the compound's properties.\n\nChemical compounds can be classified based on their composition and the types of bonds they contain. They can be further described by their empirical or molecular formulas, which provide information about the identity and arrangement of the elements within the compound.\n\nIn summary, chemical compounds are formed through the interaction of atoms held together by chemical bonds, resulting in substances with specific compositions and properties.
