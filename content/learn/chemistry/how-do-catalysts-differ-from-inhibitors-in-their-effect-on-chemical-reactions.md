    How do catalysts differ from inhibitors in their effect on chemical reactions?
answer: >-
    Catalysts and inhibitors are two types of substances that significantly influence the rates of chemical reactions, but they do so in opposite ways.\n\nA **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. This means that a catalyst provides an alternative pathway for the reaction, allowing it to occur more quickly without being consumed in the process. Catalysts do not alter the energy of the reactants or products, and they do not change the equilibrium constant of the reaction. Their primary role is to facilitate the reaction by making it easier for reactants to collide with sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier.\n\nIn contrast, an **inhibitor** is a substance that decreases the rate of a chemical reaction. Inhibitors achieve this by increasing the activation energy barrier or by directly interfering with the reactants or the reaction mechanism. This interference can slow down or completely halt the reaction. Inhibitors can be thought of as "negative catalysts," as they impede the progress of the reaction rather than promote it.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between catalysts and inhibitors are:\n\n- **Effect on Reaction Rate**: Catalysts increase the reaction rate, while inhibitors decrease it.\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Catalysts lower the activation energy, facilitating the reaction, whereas inhibitors raise the activation energy or interfere with the reactants, hindering the reaction.\n- **Consumption**: Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction and can be used repeatedly, while inhibitors may remain in the system but do not facilitate the reaction.\n\nBoth catalysts and inhibitors play crucial roles in chemical reactions, influencing how quickly or slowly reactions occur, which is essential in various fields, including industrial chemistry, biochemistry, and environmental science.
