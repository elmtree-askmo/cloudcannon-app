    What are some examples of extensive properties?
answer: >-
    Extensive properties are those physical properties of matter that depend on the amount of substance present in a sample. Some common examples of extensive properties include:\n\n1. **Mass**: The quantity of matter in a sample, which increases as the amount of substance increases.\n2. **Volume**: The space occupied by a substance, which also varies with the amount of material present.\n3. **Weight**: The force exerted by gravity on a mass, which is directly proportional to the mass of the substance.\n4. **Length**: The measurement of distance, which changes with the size of the sample.\n5. **Size**: A general term that can refer to the dimensions or extent of a sample.\n6. **Internal Energy**: The total energy contained within a system, which depends on the amount of matter present.\n\nThese properties are useful for describing a sample but are not particularly helpful for identifying substances, as they can change based on the sample size or conditions. In contrast, intensive properties, such as density, boiling point, and color, remain constant regardless of the amount of substance.
