    What are the defining characteristics of heterogeneous mixtures?
answer: >-
    Heterogeneous mixtures are defined by several key characteristics:\n\n1. **Visibly Different Components**: Heterogeneous mixtures consist of two or more substances that are visibly distinct. The individual components can be seen and identified, which differentiates them from homogeneous mixtures where the composition is uniform.\n\n2. **Separation by Physical Means**: The components of a heterogeneous mixture can be easily separated using physical methods such as filtration, decanting, or manual sorting. This is possible because the substances retain their individual properties.\n\n3. **Non-uniform Composition**: In a heterogeneous mixture, the distribution of components is not uniform. For example, in a salad, you can see and separate the individual ingredients like lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Similarly, in a mixture of oil and water, the two liquids do not mix and form distinct layers.\n\n4. **Presence of Phases**: Heterogeneous mixtures often contain different phases, which can be solid, liquid, or gas. For instance, a mixture of sand and iron filings contains solid particles that can be distinguished from one another.\n\nExamples of heterogeneous mixtures include:\n- Salad, where the individual ingredients are visible and separable.\n- Oil and water, which do not mix and form separate layers.\n- A mixture of sand and gravel, where the different sizes and types of particles can be easily identified.\n\nIn summary, the defining characteristics of heterogeneous mixtures are their visibly distinct components, the ability to separate them by physical means, non-uniform composition, and the presence of different phases.
