    What is the definition of matter in terms of mass and volume?
answer: >-
    Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies volume. In more detail:\n\n- **Mass** is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, typically quantified in units such as grams (g) or kilograms (kg). It reflects the quantity of matter present and is a fundamental property that influences an object's inertia, or its resistance to changes in motion.\n\n- **Volume** is the amount of space that matter occupies, measured in units such as liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cm³). It provides a three-dimensional measure of how much space an object takes up.\n\nTogether, these two properties—mass and volume—are essential for understanding the behavior of matter in various states (solid, liquid, gas) and under different conditions. They also play a crucial role in calculations involving density, which is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance. \n\nIn summary, matter is characterized by its mass and volume, making these properties fundamental to the study of physical science.
