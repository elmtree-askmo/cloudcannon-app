    How is theoretical yield calculated?
answer: >-
    To calculate the theoretical yield of a chemical reaction, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Limiting Reactant**: The limiting reactant is the substance that is completely consumed first in the reaction, thus determining the maximum amount of product that can be formed.\n\n2. **Write the Balanced Chemical Equation**: Ensure that the chemical equation is balanced, as this will provide the mole ratios needed for calculations.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Moles of the Limiting Reactant**: Convert the mass of the limiting reactant to moles using its molar mass. This can be done using the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}}\n   $$\n\n4. **Use Mole Ratios to Find Theoretical Yield**: From the balanced equation, use the mole ratio between the limiting reactant and the desired product to calculate the number of moles of the product that can be formed. For example, if the balanced equation shows that 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2, you can set up the following relationship:\n   $$\n   \text{moles of } O_2 = \text{moles of } KClO3 \times \frac{3 \text{ moles } O_2}{2 \text{ moles } KClO3}\n   $$\n\n5. **Convert Moles of Product to Grams**: Finally, convert the moles of the product to grams using its molar mass:\n   $$\n   \text{theoretical yield (g)} = \text{moles of product} \times \text{molar mass of product (g/mol)}\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\nFor instance, consider the reaction:\n$$\n2 \text{KClO}_3 \rightarrow 3 \text{O}_2 + 2 \text{KCl}\n$$\nIf you start with 9 moles of KClO3, the theoretical yield of O2 can be calculated as follows:\n1. From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of KClO3 to O2 is 2:3.\n2. Calculate moles of O2 produced:\n   $$\n   \text{moles of } O_2 = 9 \text{ moles KClO3} \times \frac{3 \text{ moles } O_2}{2 \text{ moles } KClO3} = 13.5 \text{ moles } O_2\n   $$\n3. Convert moles of O2 to grams (using the molar mass of O2, which is approximately 32 g/mol):\n   $$\n   \text{theoretical yield of } O_2 = 13.5 \text{ moles} \times 32 \text{ g/mol} = 432 \text{ g}\n   $$\n\nThis process allows you to determine the theoretical yield of a product based on the limiting reactant and the stoichiometry of the reaction.
