    In the research concerning the rapid determination of phenolic compounds and their implications for the Brazilian wine industry, several statistical analysis methods were employed to interpret the data effectively. The primary statistical techniques utilized include:\n\n1. **Linear Regression**: This method was used to establish relationships between variables, particularly in determining the best wavelength for measuring total phenolic compounds in extracts. The study indicated that a wavelength of 725 nm was optimal for this purpose.\n\n2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Basic statistical measures were likely employed to summarize the data, although specific details on this were not provided in the gathered information.\n\n3. **Method Validation Statistics**: The validation of the RP-HPLC-DAD method included evaluations of limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), calibration curves, recovery rates, and both intra-day and inter-day precision. These statistical analyses ensure the reliability and accuracy of the method used for quantifying phenolic compounds.\n\n4. **Multivariate Statistical Techniques**: These techniques were applied to differentiate between grape cultivars based on their phenolic content and antioxidant properties. This approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the data by considering multiple variables simultaneously.\n\n5. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Specifically, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN was utilized to correlate phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity in vitro. This advanced statistical method helps in modeling complex relationships within the data.\n\n6. **Response Surface Methodology**: A Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize extraction parameters for antioxidant polyphenols, which involves statistical modeling to find the best conditions for maximizing total phenolic content and antioxidant activity.\n\nThese statistical methods collectively enhance the robustness of the research findings, allowing for a thorough analysis of phenolic compounds and their health benefits, as well as their implications for the Brazilian wine industry.
