    What are homonuclear diatomic molecules and how do they differ from heteronuclear diatomic molecules?
answer: >-
    Homonuclear diatomic molecules are defined as molecules composed of exactly two identical atoms. Examples of homonuclear diatomic molecules include hydrogen (H₂), nitrogen (N₂), oxygen (O₂), and the halogens such as fluorine (F₂), chlorine (Cl₂), and iodine (I₂). These molecules typically exhibit a pure covalent bond, where the electrons are shared equally between the identical atoms, resulting in non-polar bonds due to the absence of electronegativity differences.\n\nIn contrast, heteronuclear diatomic molecules consist of two different atoms bonded together. Examples include hydrogen fluoride (HF), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). In these molecules, the bond is often polar covalent, as the two different atoms usually have differing electronegativities, leading to an unequal sharing of electrons.\n\nThe primary difference between homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules lies in the identity of the atoms that compose them. Homonuclear diatomic molecules are made up of the same element, while heteronuclear diatomic molecules are formed from two different elements. This distinction affects the nature of the bonding and the physical properties of the molecules, such as polarity and bond strength.
