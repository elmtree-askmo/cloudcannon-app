    Explain the process of vaporization and how it differs from condensation.
answer: >-
    Vaporization is the process by which a liquid transforms into a gas. This can occur in two primary ways: through boiling and evaporation. Boiling happens when a liquid reaches its boiling point, while evaporation can occur at any temperature when molecules at the surface of the liquid gain enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces and escape into the gas phase.\n\nThe enthalpy change associated with vaporization is known as the heat of vaporization ($ \Delta H_{\text{vap}} $). For water, the heat of vaporization is approximately 2260 J/g at 100Â°C, meaning that this amount of energy is required to convert 1 gram of water from liquid to gas. This process is endothermic, as it requires the absorption of energy to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.\n\nIn contrast, condensation is the process where water vapor transitions back into liquid water. This process is exothermic, meaning it releases energy into the environment. The energy released during condensation is equal to the heat of vaporization, approximately 2260 J/g for water. Thus, when 1 gram of water vapor condenses, it releases 2260 joules of energy.\n\n### Key Differences Between Vaporization and Condensation:\n\n1. **Direction of Phase Change**:\n   - **Vaporization**: Liquid to gas (endothermic).\n   - **Condensation**: Gas to liquid (exothermic).\n\n2. **Energy Transfer**:\n   - **Vaporization**: Absorbs energy from the surroundings.\n   - **Condensation**: Releases energy to the surroundings.\n\n3. **Enthalpy Change**:\n   - The enthalpy of vaporization ($ \Delta H_{\text{vap}} $) is the energy required for vaporization, while the energy released during condensation is equal to this value.\n\nThese processes are crucial in various natural phenomena, including the water cycle, where evaporation and condensation play significant roles in climate regulation and energy transfer within the atmosphere.
