    A double replacement reaction is a chemical reaction where two reactants exchange ions to form two new products, commonly occurring between ionic compounds in solution, characterized by ion exchange and often resulting in water, precipitate, or gas.

    What is the definition of a double replacement reaction?
answer: >-
    A double replacement reaction, also known as a double displacement reaction or metathesis reaction, is a type of chemical reaction where two reactants exchange ions to form two new products. This reaction typically occurs between ionic compounds in an aqueous solution. The general form of a double replacement reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\ce{AB} + \ce{CD} \rightarrow \ce{AD} + \ce{CB}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, the positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) of the reactants switch places, resulting in the formation of two new compounds. Common examples of double replacement reactions include neutralization reactions, where an acid reacts with a base to produce water and a salt, and precipitation reactions, where two soluble salts react to form an insoluble compound (precipitate).\n\nDouble replacement reactions are characterized by the exchange of ions and often lead to the formation of a precipitate, gas, or water, depending on the specific reactants involved.
