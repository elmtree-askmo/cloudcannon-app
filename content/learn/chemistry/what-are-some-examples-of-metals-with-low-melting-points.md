    What are some examples of metals with low melting points?
answer: >-
    Some examples of metals with low melting points include:\n\n1. **Mercury (Hg)** - Melting point: -39°C (-38.8°F). Mercury is unique as it remains in liquid form at room temperature, making it useful in thermometers and barometers.\n\n2. **Gallium (Ga)** - Melting point: approximately 29.76°C (85.57°F). Gallium is notable for melting in the hand, which demonstrates its low melting point and practical applications in electronics and semiconductors.\n\n3. **Cesium (Cs)** - Melting point: 28.5°C (83.3°F). Cesium is another metal that has a low melting point, and it is often used in atomic clocks.\n\n4. **Potassium (K)** - Melting point: 63.5°C (146.3°F). Potassium is an alkali metal that also has a relatively low melting point.\n\n5. **Tin (Sn)** - Melting point: 231.93°C (449.47°F). Tin is widely used in soldering due to its low melting temperature.\n\n6. **Lead (Pb)** - Melting point: 327.5°C (621.5°F). Lead is known for its malleability and is often used in batteries and radiation shielding.\n\n7. **Bismuth (Bi)** - Melting point: 271.4°C (520.5°F). Bismuth is used as a non-toxic substitute for lead in various applications, including solders.\n\nThese metals are particularly valuable in applications that require materials that can melt and solidify at relatively low temperatures.
