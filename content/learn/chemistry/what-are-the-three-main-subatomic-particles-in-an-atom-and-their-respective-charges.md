    What are the three main subatomic particles in an atom and their respective charges?
answer: >-
    The three main subatomic particles in an atom are:\n\n1. **Protons**: \n   - Charge: Positively charged (+1).\n   - Location: Found in the nucleus of the atom.\n   - Role: The number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number of an element, which determines the element's identity. For example, an atom with 6 protons is carbon, while an atom with 8 protons is oxygen.\n\n2. **Neutrons**: \n   - Charge: Neutral (0).\n   - Location: Also located in the nucleus alongside protons.\n   - Role: Neutrons contribute to the atomic mass of the atom but do not affect the atomic number. The total number of protons and neutrons gives the atomic mass of the atom.\n\n3. **Electrons**: \n   - Charge: Negatively charged (-1).\n   - Location: Orbiting the nucleus in defined energy levels or orbitals.\n   - Role: The number of electrons determines the atom's charge and its chemical behavior. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, balancing the overall charge.\n\nIn summary, protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it, and their respective charges are crucial for defining the atom's properties and interactions.
