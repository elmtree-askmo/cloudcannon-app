    How do lanthanoids and actinoids differ in their chemical reactivity?
answer: >-
    Lanthanoids and actinoids, both belonging to the f-block of the periodic table, exhibit significant differences in their chemical reactivity due to their distinct electronic configurations and properties.\n\n1. **Electronic Configuration**: \n   - Lanthanoids have their last differentiating electron occupying the 4f orbital, while actinoids have their last electron in the 5f orbital. This difference in the subshell being filled contributes to their reactivity.\n\n2. **Reactivity Levels**: \n   - Lanthanoids are relatively reactive, but their reactivity is generally more uniform across the series. In contrast, actinoids are more reactive overall, particularly in finely divided states. This heightened reactivity is attributed to their higher atomic numbers and the presence of additional f-electrons, which can lead to a greater variety of oxidation states.\n\n3. **Oxidation States**: \n   - Actinoids exhibit a larger number of oxidation states compared to lanthanoids. This is due to the smaller energy gap between the 5f and 6d subshells in actinoids, allowing for more versatile chemical behavior.\n\n4. **Radioactivity**: \n   - Actinoids are predominantly radioactive, which influences their chemical reactivity and applications. In contrast, lanthanoids are mostly non-radioactive (with the exception of promethium), leading to different stability and reactivity profiles.\n\n5. **Applications**: \n   - The chemical reactivity of lanthanoids is often utilized in optical devices and alloys, while actinoids find applications in nuclear technology and devices that leverage their radioactivity, such as cardiac pacemakers.\n\nIn summary, while both lanthanoids and actinoids are f-block elements, actinoids are generally more reactive due to their electronic structure, greater variety of oxidation states, and radioactivity, distinguishing them significantly from lanthanoids.
