    Compare the pH of pure water, orange juice, and bleach.
answer: >-
    To compare the pH of pure water, orange juice, and bleach, we can use the concept of pH, which is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]\n$$\n\n### pH Values of Each Solution\n\n1. **Pure Water**:\n   - At 25Â°C, the concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) in pure water is approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar.\n   - Calculating the pH:\n     $$\n     \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-7}) = 7\n     $$\n   - **Conclusion**: Pure water has a pH of 7, which is considered neutral.\n\n2. **Orange Juice**:\n   - The hydrogen ion concentration in orange juice is about $1 \times 10^{-4}$ molar.\n   - Calculating the pH:\n     $$\n     \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-4}) = 4\n     $$\n   - **Conclusion**: Orange juice has a pH of 4, indicating it is acidic.\n\n3. **Bleach**:\n   - The hydrogen ion concentration in bleach is approximately $1 \times 10^{-12}$ molar.\n   - Calculating the pH:\n     $$\n     \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-12}) = 12\n     $$\n   - **Conclusion**: Bleach has a pH of 12, indicating it is basic.\n\n### Summary of Comparison\n- **Pure Water**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M\n  - pH: 7 (neutral)\n  \n- **Orange Juice**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-4}$ M\n  - pH: 4 (acidic)\n  \n- **Bleach**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-12}$ M\n  - pH: 12 (basic)\n\n### Implications\nThe pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:\n- Values below 7 indicate acidity (like orange juice).\n- Values above 7 indicate basicity (like bleach).\n- A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water).\n\nThis comparison illustrates the significant differences in acidity and basicity among these common substances.
