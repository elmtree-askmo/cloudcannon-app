answer: >-
    In the context of ion formation, aluminum (Al) and sulfur (S) can combine to form an ionic compound through the transfer of electrons. Hereâ€™s how the process works:\n\n1. **Aluminum Ion Formation**: Aluminum is a metal that has three valence electrons. To achieve a stable electron configuration, aluminum tends to lose these three electrons, resulting in the formation of a cation with a charge of +3. This can be represented as:\n   $$ \n   \text{Al} \rightarrow \text{Al}^{3+} + 3e^- \n   $$\n\n2. **Sulfur Ion Formation**: Sulfur, on the other hand, is a non-metal with six valence electrons. To achieve a full valence shell (octet), sulfur gains two electrons, forming an anion with a charge of -2. This can be represented as:\n   $$ \n   \text{S} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{S}^{2-} \n   $$\n\n3. **Formation of Ionic Compound**: When aluminum and sulfur react, the aluminum cation ($\text{Al}^{3+}$) and the sulfur anion ($\text{S}^{2-}$) combine to form the ionic compound aluminum sulfide. The chemical formula for this compound is determined by balancing the charges of the ions. To achieve neutrality, two aluminum ions are needed for every three sulfur ions, leading to the formula:\n   $$ \n   \text{Al}_2\text{S}_3 \n   $$\n\nIn summary, the formation of ions from aluminum and sulfur involves aluminum losing three electrons to form $\text{Al}^{3+}$ and sulfur gaining two electrons to form $\text{S}^{2-}$. The resulting ionic compound is aluminum sulfide, represented by the formula $\text{Al}_2\text{S}_3$.
