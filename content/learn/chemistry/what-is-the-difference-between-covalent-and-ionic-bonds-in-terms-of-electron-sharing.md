    What is the difference between covalent and ionic bonds in terms of electron sharing?
answer: >-
    The primary difference between covalent and ionic bonds in terms of electron sharing lies in how electrons are managed between the atoms involved in the bonding process.\n\n### Ionic Bonds\nIonic bonds are characterized by the **transfer of electrons** from one atom to another. This typically occurs between metals and non-metals. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na) donates one electron to chlorine (Cl). As a result, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na⁺), while chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl⁻). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond. This type of bond emphasizes the creation of ions through electron transfer rather than sharing.\n\n### Covalent Bonds\nIn contrast, covalent bonds involve the **sharing of electrons** between atoms. This sharing allows each atom to achieve a stable electron configuration, often filling their valence shells. For instance, in a water molecule (H₂O), each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds. Covalent bonding can vary in strength and can be classified into single, double, or triple bonds based on the number of shared electron pairs.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key distinction is:\n- **Ionic Bonds**: Result from the transfer of electrons, leading to the formation of charged ions.\n- **Covalent Bonds**: Result from the sharing of electrons between atoms.\n\nThis fundamental difference influences the properties and behaviors of the compounds formed by these types of bonds, such as their melting and boiling points, solubility, and electrical conductivity.
