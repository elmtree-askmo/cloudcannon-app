    What is the definition of atomic mass units (AMU) and how do they relate to atomic mass?
answer: >-
    Atomic mass units (AMU) are a standard unit of mass used to quantify mass on an atomic or molecular scale. One AMU is defined as one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. This definition provides a reference point that is widely accepted in the scientific community, facilitating the expression and comparison of atomic and molecular weights.\n\nThe significance of AMU in measuring atomic mass lies in its ability to provide a standardized measurement that allows scientists to compare the masses of different atoms and molecules effectively. For instance, the atomic mass of chlorine isotopes can be expressed in AMU, with chlorine-35 having an atomic mass of 35 AMU and chlorine-37 having an atomic mass of 37 AMU. \n\nIn summary, AMU serves as a crucial unit in the field of chemistry and physics, enabling the accurate representation of atomic mass and facilitating the understanding of the differences in mass among various isotopes.
