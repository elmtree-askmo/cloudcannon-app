    How does the pH scale measure acidity and basicity?
answer: >-
    The pH scale is a fundamental tool used to measure the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of aqueous solutions, ranging from 0 to 14. It was introduced in 1909 by the biochemist Soren Peter Lauritz Sorensen to provide a standardized method for quantifying how acidic or basic a substance is.\n\n### Understanding the pH Scale\n\n- **Definition**: The pH scale quantifies the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. The formula for calculating pH is given by:\n\n  $$\n  pH = -\log[H^+]\n  $$\n\n- **Scale Values**:\n  - A pH of **7** is considered neutral, indicating a balance between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions (OH-).\n  - Values **below 7** indicate acidity, with lower values representing stronger acids. For example, a solution with a pH of 2 is strongly acidic.\n  - Values **above 7** indicate basicity (or alkalinity), with higher values representing stronger bases. For instance, a solution with a pH of 12 is strongly basic.\n\n### Relationship Between pH and Acidity\n\nThe pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole number change on the scale represents a tenfold change in acidity. Therefore, a solution with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than one with a pH of 4. \n\n- **Acidity**: Acidity refers to the capacity of a solution to donate hydrogen ions. The more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH and the more acidic the solution becomes. Conversely, solutions with fewer hydrogen ions (higher pH) are less acidic or basic.\n\n- **pH and pOH Relationship**: The relationship between pH and pOH is defined by the equation:\n\n  $$\n  pH + pOH = 14\n  $$\n\nThis means that if you know the pH of a solution, you can easily calculate its pOH, which is a measure of hydroxide ion concentration.\n\n### Importance of pH\n\nThe pH of a solution is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science. It affects enzyme activity, metabolic processes, and the solubility of compounds. Understanding the pH scale and its implications is essential for maintaining optimal conditions in biological systems and chemical reactions.
