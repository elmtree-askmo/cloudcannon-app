    What is the definition of oxidation in redox chemistry?
answer: >-
    In redox chemistry, oxidation is defined as the process in which a substance loses electrons. This loss of electrons results in an increase in the oxidation state of the substance. In a redox reaction, oxidation occurs simultaneously with reduction, where another substance gains the electrons that were lost. \n\nFor example, in the rusting of iron, iron (Fe) is oxidized from its elemental state (FeÂ°) to a higher oxidation state (Fe^{+3}), while oxygen is reduced. This electron transfer is a fundamental aspect of redox reactions, which are characterized by the changes in oxidation states of the reacting species. \n\nIn summary, oxidation can be succinctly defined as:\n- **Oxidation:** The loss of electrons by a species, leading to an increase in its oxidation state.
