    How does the reactivity of hydrogen compare to that of oxygen?
answer: >-
    The reactivity of hydrogen and oxygen can be compared in several ways, particularly in terms of their roles in chemical reactions and their tendencies to undergo reactions.\n\n1. **Reactivity Overview**:\n   - **Hydrogen (H₂)**: Hydrogen is a highly reactive element, especially in the presence of oxygen. It readily combines with oxygen to form water (H₂O) in a combustion reaction. The reaction can be represented as:\n     $$\n     2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n     $$\n     This reaction is exothermic, releasing energy in the form of heat and light. Hydrogen's reactivity is influenced by its position in the periodic table, where it is a nonmetal with a tendency to lose its single electron to form a positive ion (H⁺).\n\n   - **Oxygen (O₂)**: Oxygen is also highly reactive, particularly as an oxidizing agent. It supports combustion and reacts with many substances, including metals and nonmetals. Oxygen's reactivity is characterized by its ability to gain electrons (reduction) during chemical reactions. For example, in the combustion of hydrogen, oxygen gains electrons as it reacts with hydrogen to form water, which can be seen as:\n     $$\n     \text{O}_2(g) + 4 \text{H} \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n     $$\n\n2. **Comparison of Reactivity**:\n   - **Combustion Reactions**: Both hydrogen and oxygen participate in combustion reactions, but they do so in different roles. Hydrogen acts as a fuel, while oxygen acts as an oxidizer. The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen is a classic example of a highly exothermic reaction, demonstrating the high reactivity of both elements.\n   - **Electronegativity**: Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, which means it has a stronger tendency to attract electrons. This difference in electronegativity influences the types of bonds formed and the nature of the reactions. In a reaction, oxygen typically gains electrons (is reduced), while hydrogen loses electrons (is oxidized).\n\n3. **Chemical Properties**:\n   - The chemical properties of both hydrogen and oxygen are evident during their reactions. For instance, when hydrogen gas combusts in the presence of oxygen, it forms water, illustrating a chemical change where the original substances are transformed into a new product.\n\nIn summary, both hydrogen and oxygen are highly reactive, but they exhibit their reactivity in different ways. Hydrogen is a reducing agent, while oxygen is an oxidizing agent. Their interaction in combustion reactions is a prime example of their reactivity, leading to the formation of water and the release of energy.
