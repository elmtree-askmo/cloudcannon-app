    How do substitution, addition, and elimination reactions differ?
answer: >-
    Substitution, addition, and elimination reactions are fundamental types of organic reactions, each with distinct characteristics and mechanisms.\n\n1. **Substitution Reactions**: In a substitution reaction, one functional group or atom in a molecule is replaced by another functional group or atom. This process typically involves a single carbon atom where a bond is both lost and gained. Substitution reactions can be classified into two main types: nucleophilic substitution (where a nucleophile replaces a leaving group) and electrophilic substitution (where an electrophile replaces a group). For example, in nucleophilic substitution, a nucleophile attacks a carbon atom, displacing a leaving group (X) and forming a new bond with another group (Y).\n\n2. **Addition Reactions**: Addition reactions involve the combination of two or more atoms or functional groups to form a single product. In these reactions, the number of sigma (σ) bonds in the substrate increases, usually at the expense of one or more pi (π) bonds. A common example is the addition of hydrogen to an alkene, resulting in the formation of an alkane. Addition reactions are characterized by the fact that no atoms are left over; all reactants are incorporated into the product.\n\n3. **Elimination Reactions**: Elimination reactions are the reverse of addition reactions. In these reactions, atoms are removed from a molecule, resulting in the formation of a double bond or a ring structure. The process typically involves the loss of a leaving group and one other atom or group from adjacent carbons. For instance, in the dehydration of alcohols, water is eliminated, leading to the formation of alkenes. Elimination reactions decrease the number of σ-bonds while increasing the number of π-bonds.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between these reactions can be outlined as follows:\n- **Substitution** involves replacing one group with another.\n- **Addition** involves combining groups to form a new product.\n- **Elimination** involves removing groups to form double bonds or rings.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for the design and synthesis of new organic compounds with specific properties and functionalities.
