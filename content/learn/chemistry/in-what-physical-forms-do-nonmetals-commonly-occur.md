    In what physical forms do non-metals commonly occur?
answer: >-
    Non-metals commonly occur in three physical forms under normal conditions of temperature and pressure: gases, solids, and one liquid. \n\n1. **Gases**: Many non-metals exist as gases at room temperature. For example, oxygen (O₂) and nitrogen (N₂) are essential gases that are vital for life and are prevalent in the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Solids**: Several non-metals are found in solid form at room temperature. Carbon (C), in its various allotropes such as graphite and diamond, is a notable example. Other solid non-metals include sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P).\n\n3. **Liquid**: Bromine (Br) is the only non-metal that is a liquid at room temperature. It is a reddish-brown liquid that readily evaporates to form a vapor.\n\nIn summary, non-metals can be found as gases (e.g., oxygen), solids (e.g., carbon, sulfur), and one liquid (bromine) at room temperature. This diversity in physical states reflects the varied properties and behaviors of non-metals compared to metals.
