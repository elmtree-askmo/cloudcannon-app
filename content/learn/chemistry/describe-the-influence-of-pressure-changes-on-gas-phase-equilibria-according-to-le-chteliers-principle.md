    Describe the influence of pressure changes on gas phase equilibria according to Le Châtelier's principle.
answer: >-
    According to Le Châtelier's principle, changes in pressure can significantly influence the position of equilibrium in gas-phase reactions. This principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the system will adjust to counteract that change and establish a new equilibrium.\n\n### Influence of Pressure Changes on Gas Phase Equilibria\n\n1. **Increasing Pressure**: When the pressure of a gaseous reaction system is increased, the equilibrium will shift toward the side of the reaction that has fewer moles of gas. This shift occurs because the system seeks to reduce the pressure by favoring the formation of products that occupy less volume. \n\n   For example, consider the following reaction:\n   $$\n   N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)\n   $$\n   In this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side (1 mole of $N_2$ and 3 moles of $H_2$) and only 2 moles of gas on the product side (2 moles of $NH_3$). Therefore, increasing the pressure will favor the formation of ammonia ($NH_3$), as it results in fewer gas molecules.\n\n2. **Decreasing Pressure**: Conversely, if the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift toward the side with more moles of gas. This shift occurs as the system attempts to increase the pressure by favoring the side that produces more gas molecules.\n\n### Summary of Effects\n- **Increased Pressure**: Shifts equilibrium toward the side with fewer gas molecules.\n- **Decreased Pressure**: Shifts equilibrium toward the side with more gas molecules.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- The effect of pressure changes is only significant in reactions involving gaseous species. In reactions where all reactants and products are in the liquid or solid state, changes in pressure have negligible effects on the position of equilibrium.\n- The stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced chemical equation are crucial in determining the direction of the shift when pressure changes occur.\n\nIn summary, Le Châtelier's principle provides a clear framework for predicting how changes in pressure will affect gas-phase equilibria, allowing chemists to manipulate conditions to favor desired products in chemical reactions.
