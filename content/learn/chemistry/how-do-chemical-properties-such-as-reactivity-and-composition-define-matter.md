    How do chemical properties such as reactivity and composition define matter?
answer: >-
    Chemical properties, such as reactivity and composition, play a crucial role in defining matter. These properties are intrinsic characteristics that become evident during chemical reactions, allowing us to understand how substances interact with one another and how they can change into different forms.\n\n1. **Reactivity**: This refers to the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical reactions. Highly reactive substances can easily form new compounds when they interact with other materials. For example, sodium (Na) is highly reactive with water, producing sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2) as shown in the reaction:\n\n   $$\n   2 \text{Na}(s) + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2 \text{NaOH}(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)\n   $$\n\n   This illustrates how sodium's reactivity leads to the formation of new substances, which is a fundamental aspect of its chemical property.\n\n2. **Composition**: The composition of a substance refers to the types and amounts of elements that make it up. This is often represented using chemical symbols and formulas. For instance, water (H2O) is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The specific arrangement and types of atoms in a substance determine its chemical behavior and properties. \n\n3. **Chemical Changes**: When a chemical reaction occurs, the original substances (reactants) are transformed into new substances (products). This transformation is indicative of a change in composition and is a hallmark of chemical properties. For example, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen to form water is a chemical change that alters the composition of the reactants.\n\n4. **Physical vs. Chemical Properties**: It is important to distinguish between physical properties (such as color, density, and state) and chemical properties. While physical properties can be observed without changing the substance's chemical identity, chemical properties require a reaction to be observed. For example, the shiny appearance of metals is a physical property, while their ability to react with acids is a chemical property.\n\nIn summary, chemical properties like reactivity and composition are essential for classifying and understanding matter. They help predict how substances will behave in different situations, which is fundamental in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and engineering.
