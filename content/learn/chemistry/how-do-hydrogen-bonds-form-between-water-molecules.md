    How do hydrogen bonds form between water molecules?
answer: >-
    Hydrogen bonds form between water molecules due to the polarity of the water molecule itself. A water molecule (H₂O) consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, which means it attracts the shared electrons in the covalent bonds more strongly. This results in a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms, creating a polar molecule.\n\nWhen water molecules are in close proximity, the positively charged hydrogen atoms of one water molecule are attracted to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules. This attraction leads to the formation of hydrogen bonds, which are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds but can be significant in large numbers. Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds: two through its hydrogen atoms and two through the lone pairs of electrons on its oxygen atom.\n\nThe dynamic nature of these hydrogen bonds means they are constantly breaking and reforming, which contributes to the unique properties of water, such as its high specific heat capacity and surface tension. In liquid water, each molecule is typically surrounded by four other water molecules, creating a network of hydrogen bonds that is crucial for the stability and behavior of water in various biological and chemical processes.
