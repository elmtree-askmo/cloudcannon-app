    How do the isotopes Chlorine 35 and Chlorine 37 differ in terms of atomic mass?
answer: >-
    Chlorine has two primary isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37, which differ in their atomic masses. \n\n- **Chlorine-35** has an atomic mass of 35 AMU (atomic mass units).\n- **Chlorine-37** has an atomic mass of 37 AMU.\n\nThe difference in atomic mass between these two isotopes is due to the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Chlorine-35 contains 18 neutrons, while chlorine-37 contains 20 neutrons. This additional mass from the extra neutrons in chlorine-37 accounts for its higher atomic mass compared to chlorine-35.\n\nIn terms of natural abundance, chlorine-35 is more prevalent, making up about 75% of naturally occurring chlorine, while chlorine-37 accounts for approximately 25%. This difference in abundance contributes to the atomic weight of chlorine, which is calculated as a weighted average of its isotopes, resulting in an atomic weight of 35.5 AMU. \n\nThus, the key differences in atomic mass between chlorine-35 and chlorine-37 are:\n\n- **Chlorine-35**: 35 AMU\n- **Chlorine-37**: 37 AMU\n\nThis distinction is important in understanding the behavior of chlorine in chemical reactions and its applications in various fields, including chemistry and medicine.
