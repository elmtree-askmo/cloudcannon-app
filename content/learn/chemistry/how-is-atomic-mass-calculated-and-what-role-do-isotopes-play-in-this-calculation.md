    How is atomic mass calculated, and what role do isotopes play in this calculation?
answer: >-
    Atomic mass is calculated as the weighted average of the masses of an element's isotopes, taking into account their natural abundances. This means that each isotope contributes to the overall atomic mass based on how common it is in nature. The formula used for this calculation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Atomic Mass} = \sum ( \text{mass of isotope} \times \text{abundance of isotope} )\n$$\n\nWhere the abundance is expressed as a fraction (e.g., 0.75 for 75%).\n\n### Role of Isotopes in Atomic Mass Calculation\n\nIsotopes are variants of a chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, leading to different atomic masses. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon-12 (with 6 protons and 6 neutrons) and carbon-13 (with 6 protons and 7 neutrons). The presence of these isotopes affects the average atomic mass of carbon as follows:\n\n1. **Natural Abundance**: The relative abundance of each isotope in nature is crucial. For instance, if carbon-12 makes up 98.9% of natural carbon and carbon-13 makes up 1.1%, the atomic mass will be closer to that of carbon-12.\n\n2. **Weighted Average**: The atomic mass is not simply the mass of the most abundant isotope; it is a weighted average that reflects both the mass and the abundance of all isotopes. This is why the atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12.01 uma, rather than exactly 12 uma.\n\n3. **Stability and Radioactivity**: Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes can have significant applications in fields such as medicine and environmental science, but they also contribute to the complexity of atomic mass calculations when considering isotopic distributions in certain contexts.\n\nIn summary, isotopes play a fundamental role in the calculation of atomic mass by providing the necessary data on mass and abundance, allowing for a precise understanding of an element's average mass as represented in the periodic table.
