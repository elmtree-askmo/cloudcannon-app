    What are endothermic and exothermic processes in thermochemistry?
answer: >-
    In thermochemistry, processes are classified as either endothermic or exothermic based on their heat exchange with the surroundings.\n\n**Endothermic Processes**: These are chemical reactions that absorb heat from their surroundings. As a result, the temperature of the surroundings decreases. The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) for endothermic reactions is positive, indicating that energy is taken in. Common examples of endothermic processes include:\n- **Photosynthesis**: Plants absorb sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n- **Melting Ice**: Ice absorbs heat from the environment to change from solid to liquid.\n- **Evaporation**: When a liquid evaporates, it absorbs heat, leading to a cooling effect.\n\n**Exothermic Processes**: In contrast, exothermic reactions release heat into the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to increase. The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) for exothermic reactions is negative, indicating that energy is released. Examples of exothermic processes include:\n- **Combustion Reactions**: Burning wood or fossil fuels releases heat and light.\n- **Respiration**: The metabolic process in living organisms that converts glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and energy.\n- **Rusting of Iron**: The oxidation of iron releases energy in the form of heat.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between these two types of processes is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science, as they play significant roles in energy transfer and transformation.
