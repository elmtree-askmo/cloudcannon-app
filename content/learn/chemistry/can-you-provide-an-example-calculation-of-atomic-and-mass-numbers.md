answer: >-
    To calculate the atomic number and mass number of an element, we can use the following definitions:\n\n- **Atomic Number (Z)**: The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It determines the element's identity.\n- **Mass Number (A)**: The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's take the element Uranium as an example, which has an atomic number of 92 and a mass number of 238.029.\n\n1. **Identify the Atomic Number (Z)**:\n   - For Uranium, $ Z = 92 $. This means there are 92 protons in the nucleus.\n\n2. **Identify the Mass Number (A)**:\n   - The mass number is approximately 238 (we typically round to the nearest whole number for mass number calculations). \n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Neutrons (N)**:\n   - The number of neutrons can be calculated using the formula:\n     $$\n     N = A - Z\n     $$\n   - Substituting the values:\n     $$\n     N = 238 - 92 = 146\n     $$\n   - Therefore, Uranium has 146 neutrons.\n\n### Summary of Uranium's Subatomic Particles:\n- **Protons**: 92\n- **Neutrons**: 146\n- **Electrons**: 92 (in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons)\n\nThis method can be applied to any element by using its atomic number and mass number to find the number of neutrons. For example, if you have an element with an atomic number of 9 (Fluorine) and a mass number of 19, you would calculate the number of neutrons as follows:\n\n1. **Atomic Number (Z)**: 9 (protons)\n2. **Mass Number (A)**: 19\n3. **Neutrons (N)**:\n   $$\n   N = 19 - 9 = 10\n   $$\n\nThus, Fluorine has 9 protons, 10 neutrons, and 9 electrons. \n\nThis approach provides a clear method for calculating atomic and mass numbers for any element.
