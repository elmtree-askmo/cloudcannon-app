    What defines a substance as an acid or a base in terms of pH?
answer: >-
    A substance is defined as an acid or a base primarily based on its effect on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution, which is measured using the pH scale.\n\n1. **Acids**: \n   - Acids are substances that increase the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. This results in a decrease in pH. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates in water, it releases hydrogen ions:\n     $$\n     \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{Cl}^-\n     $$\n   - Solutions with a pH less than 7 are considered acidic. The lower the pH, the stronger the acid, as it indicates a higher concentration of H⁺ ions.\n\n2. **Bases**: \n   - Bases are substances that decrease the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, which raises the pH. This can occur by binding free H⁺ ions or by releasing hydroxide ions (OH⁻). For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions:\n     $$\n     \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n     $$\n   - Solutions with a pH greater than 7 are considered basic (or alkaline). The higher the pH, the stronger the base, as it indicates a lower concentration of H⁺ ions.\n\n3. **pH Scale**: \n   - The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:\n     - A pH of 7 is neutral (pure water).\n     - A pH less than 7 indicates acidity (strong acids have lower pH values).\n     - A pH greater than 7 indicates basicity (strong bases have higher pH values).\n\n4. **Buffer Systems**: \n   - Buffers are substances that help maintain a stable pH by neutralizing added acids or bases. For example, the bicarbonate buffer system in human blood helps regulate pH by balancing the concentration of carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) and bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻):\n     $$\n     \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-\n     $$\n   - This system can shift to either release or absorb H⁺ ions, thus stabilizing the pH.\n\nIn summary, acids increase H⁺ concentration and lower pH, while bases decrease H⁺ concentration and raise pH. The pH scale is a logarithmic measure of this concentration, with buffers playing a crucial role in maintaining pH stability in various environments.
