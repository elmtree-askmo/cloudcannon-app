    What are the defining features of alkenes?
answer: >-
    Alkenes are a significant class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). Here are the defining features of alkenes:\n\n1. **Chemical Structure**: Alkenes have the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$, which indicates that they contain two fewer hydrogen atoms than their saturated counterparts, the alkanes, which have the formula $C_nH_{2n+2}$. This unsaturation is due to the presence of the double bond.\n\n2. **Physical Properties**:\n   - **State**: The first three alkenes (ethene, propene, and butene) are gases at room temperature, while those with five to eighteen carbon atoms are typically liquids, and higher alkenes are solids.\n   - **Color and Odor**: Most alkenes are colorless and odorless, with the exception of ethene, which has a sweet smell.\n   - **Solubility**: Alkenes are insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene.\n\n3. **Reactivity**: Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the presence of the carbon-carbon double bond, which is a site for chemical reactions. They primarily undergo addition reactions, where atoms or groups are added across the double bond. Other types of reactions include elimination, oxidation, and photooxygenation.\n\n4. **Hybridization**: The carbon atoms in alkenes are sp² hybridized, which means that they have a planar structure around the double bond. This hybridization leads to the formation of a π bond in addition to the σ bond between the carbon atoms.\n\n5. **Isomerism**: Alkenes can exhibit geometric (cis/trans) isomerism due to the restricted rotation around the double bond. This results in different spatial arrangements of substituents attached to the double-bonded carbons.\n\n6. **Applications**: Alkenes are important in organic chemistry and are often used as building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. They readily participate in various chemical reactions, making them valuable in industrial applications.\n\nIn summary, alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with distinctive structural, physical, and chemical properties that make them a crucial topic in organic chemistry.
