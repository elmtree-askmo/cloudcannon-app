    How can you calculate hydrogen ion concentration from a given pH value?
answer: >-
    To calculate the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$ from a given pH value, you can use the relationship defined by the pH formula:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n$$\n\nTo find the hydrogen ion concentration, you need to rearrange this equation. By applying the properties of logarithms, you can express $[H^+]$ in terms of pH:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration from pH:\n\n1. **Obtain the pH Value**: Start with the pH value of the solution you are analyzing.\n2. **Use the Rearranged Formula**: Substitute the pH value into the rearranged formula.\n3. **Calculate**: Use a calculator to compute the value of $10^{-\text{pH}}$.\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nIf the pH of a solution is 3.67, you can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration as follows:\n\n1. Substitute the pH value into the formula:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-3.67}\n   $$\n\n2. Calculate:\n   $$\n   [H^+] \approx 2.14 \times 10^{-4} \text{ mol/L}\n   $$\n\nThis result indicates that the solution is acidic, as it has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions compared to pure water, which has a hydrogen ion concentration of approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M at 25Â°C.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- The unit for hydrogen ion concentration is typically expressed in moles per liter (mol/L or M).\n- When performing calculations, be mindful of significant figures based on the precision of the pH measurement.\n- The logarithmic relationship means that a small change in pH corresponds to a large change in hydrogen ion concentration, highlighting the sensitivity of pH measurements in chemistry. \n\nThis method is widely used in chemistry to assess the acidity or basicity of solutions, making it a fundamental concept in acid-base chemistry.
