    What is the charge of an electron and where are they located in an atom?
answer: >-
    The charge of an electron is approximately -1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, which is a fundamental physical constant known as the elementary charge. This negative charge is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge of a proton, which is +1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.\n\nElectrons are located in the electron cloud that surrounds the nucleus of an atom, which contains protons and neutrons. Unlike classical models that depict electrons in fixed orbits, the modern quantum-mechanical model describes electrons as existing in regions of probability called orbitals. These orbitals represent areas where electrons are likely to be found, rather than specific paths. Electrons are organized into shells and subshells based on their energy levels, and they fill these orbitals in a manner that minimizes the energy of the atom.\n\nIn summary, electrons have a negative charge and are found in the electron cloud surrounding the atomic nucleus, where their positions are described by quantum mechanics rather than fixed orbits.
