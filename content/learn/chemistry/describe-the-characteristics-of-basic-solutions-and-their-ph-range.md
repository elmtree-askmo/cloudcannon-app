question: >-
    Describe the characteristics of basic solutions and their pH range.
answer: >-
    Basic solutions, also known as alkaline solutions, are characterized by a pH greater than 7. This means that in basic solutions, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) is higher than that of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺). The pH scale is logarithmic, which implies that each whole number change on the scale represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration. \n\n### Characteristics of Basic Solutions:\n1. **pH Range**: Basic solutions have a pH range from just above 7 to 14. The higher the pH, the more basic the solution is.\n2. **Ion Concentration**: In basic solutions, the concentration of hydroxide ions exceeds that of hydrogen ions. For example, a solution with a pH of 12 has a significantly higher concentration of OH⁻ compared to H₃O⁺.\n3. **Common Examples**: Everyday substances that are considered basic include:\n   - **Bleach**: Typically has a pH around 12-13.\n   - **Baking Soda**: Has a pH around 9.\n   - **Seawater**: Generally has a pH slightly above 7, making it mildly basic.\n\n### Implications of Basic Solutions:\n- Basic solutions can neutralize acids, which is a fundamental property utilized in various chemical reactions and processes.\n- The understanding of pH and the nature of basic solutions is crucial in fields such as chemistry, biology, and environmental science, as it affects biological systems and chemical equilibria.\n\nIn summary, basic solutions are defined by their pH greater than 7, a higher concentration of hydroxide ions, and their ability to neutralize acids, making them essential in both scientific and everyday contexts.
