    Can you summarize the trends in electronegativity across the periodic table?
answer: >-
    Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons when it is part of a chemical compound. The trends in electronegativity across the periodic table can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Horizontal Trend (Across a Period)**: Electronegativity increases as you move from left to right across a period. This is due to the increase in nuclear charge (more protons) without a significant increase in shielding effect, which allows the nucleus to exert a stronger pull on the valence electrons. For example, in Period 3, electronegativity increases from sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl).\n\n2. **Vertical Trend (Down a Group)**: Electronegativity decreases as you move down a group in the periodic table. Although the nuclear charge increases with the addition of protons, the effect is countered by the increase in the number of electron shells. This results in greater distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons, leading to a weaker attraction. For instance, fluorine (F) at the top of Group 17 has a higher electronegativity than iodine (I) further down the group.\n\n3. **Exceptions**: The noble gases, located in Group 18, are generally considered exceptions to the trend as they have very low electronegativity values due to their complete valence electron shells, making them relatively inert and not inclined to attract electrons.\n\nOverall, the general rule can be summarized as: "Electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group." The highest electronegativity value is found in fluorine, which is located at the upper right of the periodic table.
