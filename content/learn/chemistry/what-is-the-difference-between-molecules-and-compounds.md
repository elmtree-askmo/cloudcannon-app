    What is the difference between molecules and compounds?
answer: >-
    The difference between molecules and compounds lies primarily in their definitions and the types of bonds that hold their constituent atoms together.\n\n1. **Molecules**: A molecule is defined as a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. These atoms can be of the same element or different elements. For example:\n   - **Diatomic Molecules**: Molecules like O₂ (oxygen) and N₂ (nitrogen) consist of two atoms of the same element.\n   - **Different Atoms**: Molecules like H₂O (water) consist of different atoms (hydrogen and oxygen) bonded together.\n\n2. **Compounds**: A compound is a specific type of molecule that contains at least two different elements that are chemically bonded together. Compounds can be formed through either covalent bonds (where atoms share electrons) or ionic bonds (where electrons are transferred between atoms). For example:\n   - **Covalent Compound**: Water (H₂O) is a compound formed by covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\n   - **Ionic Compound**: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a compound formed by ionic bonds between sodium and chloride ions.\n\nIn summary, while all compounds are molecules (since they consist of atoms bonded together), not all molecules are compounds. A molecule can be a compound only if it contains different types of atoms. If it consists of the same type of atoms, it is simply referred to as a molecule.
