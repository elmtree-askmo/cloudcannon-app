    Can you provide examples of heterogeneous mixtures?
answer: >-
    Heterogeneous mixtures are characterized by the presence of visibly different substances or phases, allowing for easy distinction and separation of their components through physical means. Here are some examples of heterogeneous mixtures:\n\n1. **Salad**: A salad contains various ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and dressing, all of which can be seen and separated.\n\n2. **Oil and Water**: When mixed, oil and water do not combine; instead, they form distinct layers due to differences in density and polarity.\n\n3. **Sand and Salt**: A mixture of sand and salt can be easily separated by dissolving the salt in water and filtering out the sand.\n\n4. **Granite**: This rock is composed of different minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, and mica, which can be visually distinguished.\n\n5. **Fruit Salad**: Similar to a regular salad, a fruit salad contains various types of fruits that can be seen and separated.\n\n6. **Cereal in Milk**: The cereal pieces float on the surface of the milk, making them easily distinguishable.\n\nThese examples illustrate the defining characteristic of heterogeneous mixtures: the ability to see and separate the individual components.
