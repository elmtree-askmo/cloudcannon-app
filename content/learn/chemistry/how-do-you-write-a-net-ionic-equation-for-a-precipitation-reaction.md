    How do you write a net ionic equation for a precipitation reaction?
answer: >-
    To write a net ionic equation for a precipitation reaction, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the Balanced Molecular Equation**: Start by writing the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation includes all reactants and products in their molecular forms. For example, consider the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride:\n   $$\n   \text{AgNO}_3(aq) + \text{NaCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s) + \text{NaNO}_3(aq)\n   $$\n\n2. **Write the Complete Ionic Equation**: Next, convert all strong electrolytes (soluble ionic compounds) into their respective ions. The complete ionic equation for the above reaction would be:\n   $$\n   \text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{NO}_3^-(aq) + \text{Na}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s) + \text{Na}^+(aq) + \text{NO}_3^-(aq)\n   $$\n\n3. **Identify and Cancel Spectator Ions**: Spectator ions are ions that appear on both sides of the equation and do not participate in the formation of the precipitate. In this case, $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{NO}_3^-$ are spectator ions. Remove them from the equation:\n   $$\n   \text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)\n   $$\n\n4. **Write the Net Ionic Equation**: The resulting equation, which shows only the ions that form the precipitate, is the net ionic equation:\n   $$\n   \text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)\n   $$\n\nThis net ionic equation effectively represents the actual chemical process occurring in the precipitation reaction, highlighting the ions that combine to form the insoluble precipitate. Remember that the net ionic equation must be balanced in terms of both mass and charge.
