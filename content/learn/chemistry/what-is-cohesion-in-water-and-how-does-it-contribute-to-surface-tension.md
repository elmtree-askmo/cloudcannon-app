    What is cohesion in water and how does it contribute to surface tension?
answer: >-
    Cohesion in water refers to the attraction between water molecules themselves, primarily due to hydrogen bonding. Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules, creating a strong network of interactions. This cohesive force is significant because it allows water molecules to stick together, which is essential for various biological and physical processes.\n\nThe high cohesion of water contributes to its surface tension, which is the elastic tendency of the water surface to minimize its area. Surface tension arises because the molecules at the surface of a body of water experience a net inward force due to the cohesive forces from the molecules below them. These surface molecules are pulled inwards and sideways by the hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules, leading to a "skin-like" effect on the water's surface.\n\nThis phenomenon is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Formation of Droplets**: The high surface tension allows water to form droplets rather than spreading out. This is particularly evident when water is placed on a hydrophobic surface, where the cohesive forces among water molecules are stronger than the adhesive forces between water and the surface.\n\n2. **Support for Small Objects**: Surface tension enables small objects, such as a needle or a water strider insect, to rest on the surface of the water without sinking, despite being denser than water. The cohesive forces at the surface create a barrier that resists external forces.\n\n3. **Capillary Action**: While cohesion is the attraction between water molecules, it works in conjunction with adhesion (the attraction between water molecules and other surfaces) to facilitate capillary action. This is vital for the movement of water in plants, where water adheres to the walls of narrow vessels and pulls other water molecules along due to cohesion.\n\nIn summary, cohesion in water, driven by hydrogen bonding, is a fundamental property that contributes to surface tension, allowing water to form droplets, support small objects, and facilitate capillary action in biological systems.
