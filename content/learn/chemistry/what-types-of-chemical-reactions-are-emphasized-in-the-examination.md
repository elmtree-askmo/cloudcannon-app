    What types of chemical reactions are emphasized in the examination?
answer: >-
    The Year 12 Chemistry Examination for 2023 in Fiji emphasizes several types of chemical reactions. Based on the gathered information, the examination includes topics such as:\n\n1. **Organic Chemical Reactions**: This includes the study of various organic compounds, their structures, and the reactions they undergo. Students are expected to identify and describe these reactions.\n\n2. **Reactions Between Ions**: This involves understanding how different ions interact in solution, which is fundamental in predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions.\n\n3. **Acid-Base Reactions**: The examination covers the principles of acid-base chemistry, including neutralization reactions and the properties of acids and bases.\n\n4. **Stoichiometry**: Students will likely encounter questions that require them to perform calculations based on the quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions.\n\n5. **Oxide Properties**: Understanding the reactions involving oxides, including their formation and reactivity, is also a focus area.\n\nThese topics reflect a comprehensive approach to chemical reactions, ensuring that students are well-versed in both theoretical concepts and practical applications.
