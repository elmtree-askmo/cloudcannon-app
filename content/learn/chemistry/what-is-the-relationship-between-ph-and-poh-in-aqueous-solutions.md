    What is the relationship between pH and pOH in aqueous solutions?
answer: >-
    The relationship between pH and pOH in aqueous solutions is fundamental to understanding acid-base chemistry. \n\n1. **Definitions**:\n   - **pH** is defined as:\n     $$\n     pH = -\log[H^+]\n     $$\n     where $[H^+]$ is the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution.\n   - **pOH** is defined as:\n     $$\n     pOH = -\log[OH^-]\n     $$\n     where $[OH^-]$ is the concentration of hydroxide ions.\n\n2. **Relationship**:\n   At 25°C, the relationship between pH and pOH is given by the equation:\n   $$\n   pH + pOH = 14\n   $$\n   This means that if you know the pH of a solution, you can easily calculate the pOH, and vice versa. For example, if the pH of a solution is 3, the pOH can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 3 = 11\n   $$\n\n3. **Context**:\n   - In pure water at 25°C, both $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ are equal to $1 \times 10^{-7} \, M$, resulting in a pH of 7 and a pOH of 7, indicating a neutral solution.\n   - Solutions with a pH less than 7 are considered acidic (higher $[H^+]$ concentration), while those with a pH greater than 7 are basic (higher $[OH^-]$ concentration).\n\n4. **Importance**:\n   This relationship is crucial for calculating the acidity or basicity of solutions in various chemical contexts, including titrations, buffer solutions, and hydrolysis of salts.\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between pH and pOH allows chemists to predict the behavior of solutions and to perform calculations necessary for various applications in chemistry.
