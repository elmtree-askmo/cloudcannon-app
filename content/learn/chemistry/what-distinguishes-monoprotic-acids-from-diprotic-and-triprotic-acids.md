    Monoprotic, diprotic, and triprotic acids are classified based on the number of ionizable protons they can donate during acid-base reactions. Monoprotic acids donate one proton, diprotic acids donate two, and triprotic acids donate three, with examples including hydrochloric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids respectively.

    What distinguishes monoprotic acids from diprotic and triprotic acids?
answer: >-
    Monoprotic, diprotic, and triprotic acids are distinguished by the number of ionizable hydrogen ions (protons) they can donate per molecule during acid-base reactions.\n\n1. **Monoprotic Acids**: These acids can donate only one proton (H+) per molecule. Examples include hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), and nitric acid (HNO3). During an acid-base titration, they transfer a single H+ ion.\n\n2. **Diprotic Acids**: These acids can donate two protons per molecule. They undergo ionization in two steps, with the first ionization typically occurring to a greater extent than the second. A common example is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which can release two protons sequentially.\n\n3. **Triprotic Acids**: These acids can donate three protons per molecule. They also ionize in a stepwise manner, with each subsequent loss of a proton becoming less favorable. An example of a triprotic acid is phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\nIn summary, the key distinction lies in the number of protons each type of acid can donate: monoprotic acids donate one, diprotic acids donate two, and triprotic acids donate three.
