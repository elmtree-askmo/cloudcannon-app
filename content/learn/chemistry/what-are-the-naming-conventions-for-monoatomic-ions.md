    What are the naming conventions for monoatomic ions?
answer: >-
    The naming conventions for monoatomic ions differ for cations and anions.\n\n1. **Monatomic Cations**: The name of a monatomic cation is simply the name of the element followed by the word "ion." For example:\n   - Na⁺ is called the sodium ion.\n   - Al³⁺ is called the aluminum ion.\n   - Ca²⁺ is called the calcium ion.\n\n   It is important to note that some elements can form multiple cations with different charges. In such cases, the charge may be indicated in the name. For example, iron can form two cations: Fe²⁺ (ferrous ion) and Fe³⁺ (ferric ion).\n\n2. **Monatomic Anions**: The name of a monatomic anion consists of the stem of the element name, the suffix "-ide," and then the word "ion." For example:\n   - Cl⁻ is called the chloride ion (from "chlor-" + "-ide").\n   - O²⁻ is called the oxide ion.\n   - N³⁻ is called the nitride ion.\n\nThese conventions help in clearly identifying the type and charge of the ions in chemical compounds.
