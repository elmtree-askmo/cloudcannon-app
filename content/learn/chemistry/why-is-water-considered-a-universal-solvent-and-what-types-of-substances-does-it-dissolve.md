    Why is water considered a universal solvent and what types of substances does it dissolve?
answer: >-
    Water is considered a universal solvent primarily due to its unique molecular structure and polarity. A water molecule (H₂O) consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms, resulting in a polar molecule. The oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, while the hydrogen atoms carry slight positive charges. This polarity allows water to interact effectively with various solutes, facilitating their dissolution.\n\n### Why Water is a Universal Solvent\n\n1. **Polarity**: The polar nature of water molecules enables them to surround and interact with other polar molecules and ionic compounds. When a solute is introduced to water, the positive part of the water molecules is attracted to negatively charged components of the solute, while the negative part is attracted to positively charged components. This interaction helps dissociate the solute into its constituent ions or molecules.\n\n2. **Dissolution of Ionic Compounds**: A classic example of water's solvent capabilities is the dissolution of salt (sodium chloride). When salt is added to water, water molecules surround the sodium ions (Na⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻), effectively isolating and dissolving them. The sodium ions are attracted to the oxygen atoms of water, while the chloride ions are attracted to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n3. **Biological Importance**: Water's ability to dissolve a wide range of substances is crucial for biological processes. It allows for the transport of nutrients, gases, and waste products in living organisms, facilitating essential chemical reactions.\n\n### Types of Substances Water Can Dissolve\n\n- **Ionic Compounds**: Such as salts (e.g., sodium chloride), which dissociate into ions in water.\n- **Polar Molecules**: Such as sugars and alcohols, which can form hydrogen bonds with water.\n- **Hydrophilic Substances**: These are substances that have an affinity for water and dissolve well in it, including many biological molecules.\n\n### Limitations of Water as a Solvent\n\nWhile water is capable of dissolving a vast array of polar and ionic compounds, it is not a true universal solvent. It cannot dissolve nonpolar substances, such as fats and oils, due to the lack of attraction between nonpolar molecules and polar water molecules. This limitation is significant in biological systems, where the separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances plays a critical role in cellular structure and function.\n\nIn summary, water's status as a universal solvent is attributed to its polar nature, which allows it to dissolve a wide variety of ionic and polar substances, making it essential for life and various chemical processes. However, it does have limitations regarding the dissolution of nonpolar substances.
