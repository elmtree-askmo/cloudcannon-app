    What happens during the formation of new substances in a chemical change, such as the reaction between iron and oxygen?
answer: >-
    During a chemical change, such as the reaction between iron and oxygen, new substances are formed through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. This process is characterized by the transformation of reactants into products, which have different chemical compositions and properties compared to the original substances.\n\nIn the specific case of iron (Fe) reacting with oxygen (O2) to form rust, which is iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), the chemical reaction can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n4 \text{Fe}(s) + 3 \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)\n$$\n\nHereâ€™s what happens during this reaction:\n\n1. **Breaking of Bonds**: The reaction begins with the breaking of the bonds in the diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) and the metallic bonds in iron (Fe). This requires energy input.\n\n2. **Formation of New Bonds**: As the reaction proceeds, new bonds are formed between iron and oxygen atoms, resulting in the creation of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). This process releases energy, often in the form of heat.\n\n3. **Observable Changes**: The formation of rust is often accompanied by observable changes, such as a color change (from metallic gray to reddish-brown) and the production of heat. These changes indicate that a chemical reaction has occurred.\n\n4. **Irreversibility**: The rusting of iron is generally considered an irreversible chemical change under normal conditions. Once iron has oxidized to form rust, it cannot be converted back to its original metallic form without significant energy input and chemical processes.\n\n5. **Environmental Factors**: The rate of rust formation can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of moisture, salt, and other environmental conditions that facilitate the oxidation process.\n\nIn summary, during the formation of new substances in a chemical change like the reaction between iron and oxygen, the original substances undergo a transformation that results in new chemical entities with distinct properties, marking a clear distinction from physical changes where the chemical identity remains unchanged.
