    Explain the formation of new substances when hydrogen and oxygen react to form water.
answer: >-
    When hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, a chemical change occurs, resulting in the formation of a new substance. This reaction can be represented by the balanced chemical equation:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\n### Reactants and Products\nIn this reaction, the reactants are diatomic hydrogen gas (H₂) and diatomic oxygen gas (O₂). When these gases react, they undergo a transformation to form water (H₂O), which is the product of the reaction. The properties of water are significantly different from those of the reactants; for example, hydrogen is a flammable gas, and oxygen supports combustion, while water is a liquid at room temperature and is essential for life.\n\n### Chemical Change\nThe formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is a clear example of a chemical change. During this process, the bonds between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms are broken and reformed. The original substances (H₂ and O₂) are no longer present in their initial forms after the reaction; instead, they have combined to create a new substance, water (H₂O). This illustrates a fundamental principle of chemistry: during a chemical reaction, the reactants are transformed into products with different chemical and physical properties.\n\n### Properties of Water\nThe structure of a water molecule is crucial to understanding its unique properties. A water molecule consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, leading to polar covalent bonds. This polarity results in a partial negative charge at the oxygen end and a partial positive charge at the hydrogen ends, giving water its characteristic properties such as high surface tension, solvent capabilities, and a relatively high boiling point compared to other similar-sized molecules.\n\nIn summary, the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water is a classic example of a chemical reaction where new substances are formed, demonstrating the transformation of reactants into products with distinct properties.
