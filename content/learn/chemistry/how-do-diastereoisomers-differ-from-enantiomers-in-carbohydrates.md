    How do diastereoisomers differ from enantiomers in carbohydrates?
answer: >-
    Diastereoisomers and enantiomers are both types of stereoisomers, which are molecules that have the same molecular formula but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. However, they exhibit distinct characteristics, particularly in carbohydrates.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Enantiomers**: These are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They have opposite configurations at all chiral centers. For example, if one enantiomer has a specific configuration at a chiral center, the other will have the opposite configuration at that same center.\n   - **Diastereomers**: In contrast, diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have opposite configurations at some (one or more) chiral centers but the same configuration at others. This means that while they share some similarities, they differ in at least one aspect of their stereochemistry.\n\n2. **Physical Properties**:\n   - Enantiomers typically share identical physical and chemical properties, except for their optical activity, which means they rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. \n   - Diastereomers, on the other hand, can have significantly different physical properties, such as melting points, boiling points, and solubility. This difference arises from their distinct spatial arrangements, which affect how they interact with other molecules.\n\n3. **Examples in Carbohydrates**:\n   - A common example of diastereomers in carbohydrates is the sugar threonine, which contains two chiral centers. The different configurations at these centers lead to the formation of multiple stereoisomers, some of which are diastereomers of each other.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between diastereoisomers and enantiomers in carbohydrates lies in their relationship to mirror images and their physical properties. Enantiomers are mirror images with opposite configurations at all chiral centers, while diastereomers are not mirror images and differ at some chiral centers, leading to distinct physical characteristics.
