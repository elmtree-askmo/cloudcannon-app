    Can you provide examples of molecules with single covalent bonds?
answer: >-
    Examples of molecules with single covalent bonds include:\n\n1. **Hydrogen (H₂)**: The hydrogen molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms, each sharing its single electron, resulting in a single covalent bond (H-H).\n\n2. **Chlorine (Cl₂)**: Similar to hydrogen, the chlorine molecule is formed by two chlorine atoms sharing one pair of electrons, represented as Cl-Cl.\n\n3. **Fluorine (F₂)**: This diatomic molecule consists of two fluorine atoms that share a pair of electrons, forming a single covalent bond (F-F).\n\n4. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**: In this molecule, hydrogen and chlorine share one pair of electrons, resulting in a single bond (H-Cl).\n\n5. **Methane (CH₄)**: In methane, carbon forms four single covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms, where each hydrogen shares its single electron with carbon.\n\n6. **Ammonia (NH₃)**: In ammonia, nitrogen forms three single covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms, sharing one electron from each hydrogen.\n\nThese examples illustrate how single covalent bonds are formed through the sharing of one pair of electrons between two atoms, contributing to the stability of the molecules.
