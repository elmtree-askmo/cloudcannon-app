    Compare molality with molarity and explain how each is calculated.
answer: >-
    Molarity and molality are both important measures of concentration in chemistry, but they differ significantly in their definitions and applications.\n\n### Definitions:\n- **Molarity (M)**: This is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. It is expressed mathematically as:\n  $$\n  M = \frac{n}{V}\n  $$\n  where:\n  - $ M $ is the molarity,\n  - $ n $ is the number of moles of solute,\n  - $ V $ is the volume of the solution in liters.\n\n- **Molality (m)**: This is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The formula for molality is:\n  $$\n  m = \frac{n_{solute}}{m_{solvent}}\n  $$\n  where:\n  - $ n_{solute} $ is the number of moles of the solute,\n  - $ m_{solvent} $ is the mass of the solvent in kilograms.\n\n### Calculation Examples:\n1. **Calculating Molarity**:\n   For example, if you dissolve 0.5 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 1 liter of water, the molarity of the solution would be calculated as follows:\n   $$\n   M = \frac{0.5 \text{ moles}}{1 \text{ L}} = 0.5 \text{ M}\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculating Molality**:\n   If you have 0.1 moles of potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) dissolved in 500 grams of water, you first convert the mass of water to kilograms (0.5 kg) and then calculate the molality:\n   $$\n   m = \frac{0.1 \, \text{moles}}{0.5 \, \text{kg}} = 0.2 \, \text{mol/kg}\n   $$\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Temperature Dependence**: Molarity is temperature-dependent because it is based on the volume of the solution, which can change with temperature. In contrast, molality is temperature-independent as it is based on the mass of the solvent, which does not change with temperature.\n  \n- **Applications**: Molality is often preferred in situations where temperature varies significantly, such as in colligative property calculations (e.g., boiling point elevation and freezing point depression), because it provides a consistent measure of concentration.\n\nIn summary, while both molarity and molality are used to express concentration, they are calculated differently and have different implications in chemical contexts. Molarity is useful for reactions in solution, while molality is more reliable for temperature-sensitive calculations.
