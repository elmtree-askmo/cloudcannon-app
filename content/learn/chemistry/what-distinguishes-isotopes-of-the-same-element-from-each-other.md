    What distinguishes isotopes of the same element from each other?
answer: >-
    Isotopes of the same element are distinguished from each other primarily by the number of neutrons they contain. While isotopes have the same number of protons, which defines the element and determines its atomic number, the variation in the number of neutrons leads to differences in their atomic masses.\n\nFor example, consider the isotopes of carbon:\n- **Carbon-12** has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu).\n- **Carbon-14** has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, resulting in an atomic mass of approximately 14 amu.\n\nThis difference in neutron count not only affects the atomic mass but can also influence the stability of the isotopes. Isotopes can be classified as:\n- **Stable isotopes**, which do not undergo radioactive decay (e.g., carbon-12).\n- **Radioactive isotopes**, which are unstable and decay over time, emitting radiation (e.g., carbon-14).\n\nThe applications of isotopes vary widely, including uses in medicine (such as in imaging and cancer treatment), archaeology (radiocarbon dating), and various scientific research fields.
