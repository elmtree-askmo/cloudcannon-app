    What are the main types of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons?
answer: >-
    The main types of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons include:\n\n1. **Combustion Reactions**: This is the most common reaction for hydrocarbons, where they react with oxygen (O₂) to produce carbon dioxide (CO₂), water (H₂O), and heat. For example, the combustion of propane can be represented as:\n   $$\n   C_3H_8 (g) + 5 O_2 (g) \rightarrow 3 CO_2 (g) + 4 H_2O (g) + \text{heat}\n   $$\n   Combustion reactions are exothermic, making hydrocarbons valuable as fuels.\n\n2. **Substitution Reactions**: Particularly relevant for saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) and aromatic compounds (arenes), substitution reactions involve replacing one atom or group in the hydrocarbon with another. For example, when methane reacts with chlorine, it can produce chloromethane and hydrogen chloride:\n   $$\n   CH_4 + Cl_2 \rightarrow CH_3Cl + HCl\n   $$\n\n3. **Addition Reactions**: These reactions are characteristic of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as alkenes and alkynes, where new substituents are added to the carbon chain. For instance, the addition of hydrogen (hydrogenation) to an alkene results in an alkane.\n\n4. **Reforming Reactions**: This involves converting straight-chain alkanes into branched alkanes, which can improve the octane rating of fuels.\n\n5. **Oxidation-Reduction Reactions**: These reactions involve changes in the oxidation state of the hydrocarbons, often characterized by the addition or removal of oxygen or hydrogen atoms.\n\n6. **Catalytic Hydrogenation**: This is a specific type of addition reaction where hydrogen is added to unsaturated hydrocarbons in the presence of a catalyst, converting them into saturated hydrocarbons.\n\nThese reactions highlight the diverse chemical behavior of hydrocarbons, which are fundamental to organic chemistry and have significant applications in various industries, particularly in fuel production and chemical synthesis.
