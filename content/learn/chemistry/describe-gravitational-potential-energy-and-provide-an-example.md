answer: >-
    Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy possessed by an object due to its position in a gravitational field. It is directly related to the height of the object above a reference point, typically the ground, and the mass of the object. The formula for calculating gravitational potential energy is given by:\n\n$$\nE_p = m \cdot g \cdot h\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $E_p$ is the gravitational potential energy,\n- $m$ is the mass of the object (in kilograms),\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on the surface of the Earth),\n- $h$ is the height of the object above the reference point (in meters).\n\n### Example of Gravitational Potential Energy\n\nConsider a scenario where a crane lifts a mass of 75 kg to a height of 8 meters. To calculate the gravitational potential energy of the mass at that height, we can use the formula:\n\n1. **Identify the values**:\n   - Mass ($m$) = 75 kg\n   - Height ($h$) = 8 m\n   - Acceleration due to gravity ($g$) = $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$\n\n2. **Substitute the values into the formula**:\n   $$\n   E_p = 75 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 8 \, \text{m}\n   $$\n\n3. **Calculate**:\n   $$\n   E_p = 75 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 8 = 5886 \, \text{J}\n   $$\n\nThus, the gravitational potential energy of the mass when lifted to a height of 8 meters is 5886 joules.\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nGravitational potential energy is a crucial concept in various real-world applications. For instance, in hydroelectric power plants, water stored at a height in a dam possesses gravitational potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy as it flows down, driving turbines to generate electricity. Another example is bungee jumping, where the jumper's potential energy at the peak of the jump is converted into kinetic energy as they fall, and then back into potential energy as they rebound upwards.\n\nUnderstanding gravitational potential energy helps in designing systems that utilize this energy effectively, such as roller coasters, water towers, and various engineering structures.
