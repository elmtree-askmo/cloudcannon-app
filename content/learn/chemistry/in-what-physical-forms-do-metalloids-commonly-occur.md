    In what physical forms do metalloids commonly occur?
answer: >-
    Metalloids, also known as semimetals, commonly occur in solid physical forms. They typically exhibit a shiny, metallic appearance, but they are generally brittle, which distinguishes them from true metals. The physical properties of metalloids are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals, allowing them to conduct electricity and heat, albeit not as efficiently as metals. \n\nIn terms of their chemical behavior, metalloids often display properties similar to nonmetals. They can form various allotropes, which are different structural forms of the same element, and these allotropes can have significantly different properties. For example, silicon and germanium are well-known metalloids that are crucial in the semiconductor industry due to their ability to conduct electricity under certain conditions.\n\nThe most commonly recognized metalloids include boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. These elements are typically found in solid form at room temperature and are utilized in a variety of applications, including semiconductors, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices, due to their unique combination of metallic and nonmetallic properties. \n\nIn summary, metalloids are primarily found as brittle solids with a metallic luster, and they exhibit a blend of properties characteristic of both metals and nonmetals.
