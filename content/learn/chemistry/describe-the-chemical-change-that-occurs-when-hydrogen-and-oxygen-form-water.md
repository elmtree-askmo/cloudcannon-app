    Describe the chemical change that occurs when hydrogen and oxygen form water.
answer: >-
    When hydrogen and oxygen undergo a chemical change to form water, the process can be described as a combustion reaction. This reaction involves the combination of two hydrogen molecules (H₂) with one oxygen molecule (O₂) to produce two molecules of water (H₂O). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\n### Description of the Chemical Change:\n\n1. **Reactants**: The reactants in this reaction are hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂). Both are diatomic molecules, meaning they consist of two atoms.\n\n2. **Chemical Bonds**: During the reaction, the chemical bonds in the reactants are broken. The H-H bonds in hydrogen molecules and the O=O bond in oxygen molecules are disrupted.\n\n3. **Formation of Water**: New bonds are formed as the hydrogen atoms combine with oxygen atoms to create water molecules. The resulting water is in a liquid state (H₂O).\n\n4. **Chemical Properties**: The properties of the reactants (hydrogen and oxygen gases) are significantly different from the properties of the product (water). For instance, hydrogen is a flammable gas, oxygen supports combustion, while water is a stable liquid at room temperature.\n\n5. **Conservation of Mass**: The reaction adheres to the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. The number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation, ensuring that mass is conserved.\n\n6. **Chemical Change**: This transformation is a chemical change because the original substances (H₂ and O₂) are converted into a new substance (H₂O) with different chemical properties. The original reactants are no longer present in their initial forms after the reaction.\n\nIn summary, the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water is a classic example of a chemical change, characterized by the breaking and forming of bonds, the production of a new substance, and the conservation of mass.
