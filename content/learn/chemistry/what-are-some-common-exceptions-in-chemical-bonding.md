    What are some common exceptions in chemical bonding?
answer: >-
    In chemical bonding, there are several notable exceptions to the octet rule, which states that atoms tend to form bonds in a way that gives them eight electrons in their valence shells. Here are the three primary categories of exceptions:\n\n1. **Incomplete Octet**: Some elements, particularly those in the second period like boron and beryllium, can form stable compounds with fewer than eight electrons. For example, boron trifluoride (BF₃) and beryllium hydride (BeH₂) are common examples where the central atom has less than an octet.\n\n2. **Odd-Electron Molecules**: Molecules that contain an odd number of valence electrons do not allow for all atoms to achieve an octet. A well-known example is nitric oxide (NO), which has a total of 11 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen and 6 from oxygen), resulting in an unpaired electron.\n\n3. **Expanded Octet**: Elements in the third period and beyond can accommodate more than eight electrons in their valence shells. This is often seen in compounds like sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), where sulfur can hold 12 electrons. This ability arises from the availability of d-orbitals in these heavier elements.\n\nThese exceptions illustrate the complexity of chemical bonding and the limitations of the octet rule, highlighting that while it serves as a useful guideline, it does not apply universally across all elements and compounds.
