    The reactivity of alkali metals increases down Group 1 of the periodic table due to increased atomic size, decreased nuclear attraction, and lower ionization energy, leading to easier loss of the outermost electron.

    How does the reactivity of alkali metals change as you move down the group?
answer: >-
    The reactivity of alkali metals, which are found in Group 1 of the periodic table, increases as you move down the group. This trend can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. **Atomic Size**: As you descend the group from lithium to francium, the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells. This increase in size means that the outermost electron is located further from the nucleus.\n\n2. **Nuclear Attraction**: The outermost electron experiences a weaker attraction to the positively charged nucleus as the distance increases. This is because the effective nuclear charge felt by the outermost electron is reduced due to the increased distance and the shielding effect of the inner electron shells.\n\n3. **Ionization Energy**: The energy required to remove the outermost electron, known as ionization energy, decreases down the group. This is because the outer electron is less tightly held by the nucleus, making it easier to lose. For example, lithium has a higher ionization energy than sodium, which in turn has a higher ionization energy than potassium.\n\n4. **Reactivity with Water and Other Substances**: The increasing reactivity is evident in the reactions of alkali metals with water. For instance, lithium reacts with water to produce lithium hydroxide and hydrogen gas, but the reaction is less vigorous compared to sodium and potassium, which react more explosively with water. Francium, being the most reactive, would react even more vigorously, although it is rare and highly radioactive.\n\n5. **Formation of Ions**: Alkali metals readily lose one electron to form cations with a +1 charge. The ease of this electron loss increases down the group, contributing to the overall increase in reactivity.\n\nIn summary, the reactivity of alkali metals increases down the group due to the increasing atomic radius, decreasing ionization energy, and the resulting ease of losing the outermost electron. This trend is crucial for understanding the chemical behavior of these elements in various reactions.
