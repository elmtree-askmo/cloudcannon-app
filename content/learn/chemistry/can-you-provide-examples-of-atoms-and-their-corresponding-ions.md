answer: >-
    Atoms are the basic units of matter, while ions are charged particles that result from the loss or gain of electrons by atoms. Here are some examples of atoms and their corresponding ions:\n\n### Examples of Atoms and Their Corresponding Ions\n\n1. **Sodium (Na)**\n   - **Atom**: Sodium (Na) is a neutral atom with 11 protons and 11 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Sodium ion (Na⁺) is formed when sodium loses one electron, resulting in a positive charge.\n\n2. **Chlorine (Cl)**\n   - **Atom**: Chlorine (Cl) is a neutral atom with 17 protons and 17 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Chloride ion (Cl⁻) is formed when chlorine gains one electron, resulting in a negative charge.\n\n3. **Magnesium (Mg)**\n   - **Atom**: Magnesium (Mg) is a neutral atom with 12 protons and 12 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) is formed when magnesium loses two electrons, resulting in a +2 charge.\n\n4. **Oxygen (O)**\n   - **Atom**: Oxygen (O) is a neutral atom with 8 protons and 8 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Oxide ion (O²⁻) is formed when oxygen gains two electrons, resulting in a -2 charge.\n\n5. **Iron (Fe)**\n   - **Atom**: Iron (Fe) is a neutral atom with 26 protons and 26 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Iron can form multiple ions, such as:\n     - Iron(II) ion (Fe²⁺) when it loses two electrons.\n     - Iron(III) ion (Fe³⁺) when it loses three electrons.\n\n6. **Sulfur (S)**\n   - **Atom**: Sulfur (S) is a neutral atom with 16 protons and 16 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Sulfide ion (S²⁻) is formed when sulfur gains two electrons, resulting in a -2 charge.\n\n7. **Nitrogen (N)**\n   - **Atom**: Nitrogen (N) is a neutral atom with 7 protons and 7 electrons.\n   - **Ion**: Nitride ion (N³⁻) is formed when nitrogen gains three electrons, resulting in a -3 charge.\n\nThese examples illustrate how atoms can transform into ions by either losing or gaining electrons, leading to the formation of cations (positively charged ions) or anions (negatively charged ions).
