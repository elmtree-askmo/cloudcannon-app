    How do you calculate theoretical yield in a chemical reaction?
answer: >-
    To calculate the theoretical yield in a chemical reaction, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Balance the Chemical Equation**: Ensure that the chemical equation for the reaction is balanced. This means that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Identify the Limiting Reactant**: Determine which reactant will be completely consumed first during the reaction. This is known as the limiting reactant, and it dictates the maximum amount of product that can be formed.\n\n3. **Calculate Moles of the Limiting Reactant**: Convert the mass of the limiting reactant to moles using its molar mass. The formula for this conversion is:\n   $$\n   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Molar Mass (g/mol)}}\n   $$\n\n4. **Use Mole Ratios**: From the balanced equation, use the mole ratio between the limiting reactant and the desired product to find the number of moles of product that can be formed. For example, if the balanced equation shows that 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2, you can set up the ratio accordingly.\n\n5. **Convert Moles of Product to Grams**: Finally, convert the moles of the product to grams using its molar mass. The formula for this conversion is:\n   $$\n   \text{Mass of Product (g)} = \text{Moles of Product} \times \text{Molar Mass of Product (g/mol)}\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\nFor instance, consider the reaction where 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. If you start with 9 moles of KClO3, the theoretical yield of O2 can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of KClO3 to O2 is 2:3.\n2. Calculate the moles of O2 produced:\n   $$\n   \text{Moles of O2} = 9 \text{ moles KClO3} \times \frac{3 \text{ moles O2}}{2 \text{ moles KClO3}} = 13.5 \text{ moles O2}\n   $$\n3. Convert moles of O2 to grams (using the molar mass of O2, which is 32 g/mol):\n   $$\n   \text{Theoretical Yield of O2} = 13.5 \text{ moles} \times 32 \text{ g/mol} = 432 \text{ grams}\n   $$\n\nThis process will give you the theoretical yield of the product under ideal conditions. Remember that the actual yield is often less than the theoretical yield due to various factors such as incomplete reactions or side reactions.
