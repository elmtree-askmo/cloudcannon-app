    Explain the physical change that occurs when aluminum foil is crumbled.
answer: >-
    When aluminum foil is crumbled, a physical change occurs. This is characterized by a change in the shape and form of the aluminum foil without altering its chemical composition. \n\nIn detail, crumbling the foil involves compressing and folding it, which results in a new configuration of the same material. The aluminum atoms remain intact and unchanged; only the arrangement of the foil is modified. This is a classic example of a physical change, where the substance retains its identity despite the alteration in its physical form.\n\nTo summarize, crumbling aluminum foil is a physical change because:\n- The material remains aluminum foil throughout the process.\n- There is no chemical reaction or formation of new substances.\n- The change is reversible; the foil can be flattened back to its original shape, demonstrating that the substance itself has not changed.\n\nThus, crumbling aluminum foil exemplifies a physical change, as it involves a transformation in shape while maintaining the same chemical properties.
