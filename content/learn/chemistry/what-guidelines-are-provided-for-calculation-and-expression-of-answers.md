    What guidelines are provided for calculation and expression of answers?
answer: >-
    The guidelines provided for calculation and expression of answers in the Ministry of Education Fiji Year 12 Chemistry Examination 2023 emphasize the importance of showing all working steps in calculations. Specifically, students are instructed to ensure that the equations used in their answers are balanced and to express their final answers correctly to two decimal places. This approach not only helps in obtaining full marks for the calculations but also demonstrates the student's understanding of the underlying chemistry concepts.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial for students to write their answers clearly in the provided answer booklet, as clarity can impact the grading of their responses. Following these guidelines will aid students in effectively communicating their solutions and achieving better results in the examination.
