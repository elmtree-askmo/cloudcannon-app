question: >-
    Provide examples of heterogeneous mixtures.
answer: >-
    Heterogeneous mixtures are characterized by the presence of visibly different substances or phases, allowing for easy distinction and separation of their components through physical means. Here are some examples of heterogeneous mixtures:\n\n1. **Salad**: A salad consists of various ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and dressing, all of which can be seen and separated from one another.\n\n2. **Oil and Water**: When mixed, oil and water do not combine but instead form distinct layers due to their differing densities and polarities.\n\n3. **Sand and Salt**: A mixture of sand and salt can be easily separated by dissolving the salt in water and filtering out the sand.\n\n4. **Granite**: This rock is composed of different minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica, which can be visually distinguished.\n\n5. **Fruit Salad**: Similar to a regular salad, a fruit salad contains various types of fruits that can be seen and identified separately.\n\n6. **Cereal in Milk**: The cereal pieces float on the surface of the milk, allowing for easy identification and separation.\n\n7. **Concrete**: A mixture of cement, water, sand, and gravel, where the individual components can be identified.\n\nThese examples illustrate the nature of heterogeneous mixtures, where the individual components retain their distinct properties and can be physically separated.
