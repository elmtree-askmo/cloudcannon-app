    What are the characteristics of covalent compounds and their molecular networks?
answer: >-
    Covalent compounds are characterized by the sharing of valence electrons between non-metal atoms, leading to the formation of distinct molecules or extensive molecular networks. Here are some key characteristics of covalent compounds and their molecular networks:\n\n### Characteristics of Covalent Compounds\n\n1. **Electron Sharing**: In covalent bonding, atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve a full outer shell, which is often referred to as the octet rule. This sharing can occur in single, double, or triple bonds, depending on the number of shared electron pairs.\n\n2. **Molecular Structure**: Covalent compounds can exist as small discrete molecules (e.g., water, H2O; ammonia, NH3) or as large, complex networks (e.g., diamond, graphite). The molecular structure significantly influences the physical properties of the compound.\n\n3. **Lower Melting and Boiling Points**: Generally, covalent compounds have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds. This is due to the relatively weaker intermolecular forces (like van der Waals forces) that hold the molecules together, as opposed to the strong electrostatic forces in ionic compounds.\n\n4. **Solubility**: Many covalent compounds are soluble in non-polar solvents but may be insoluble in polar solvents. This is due to the nature of the intermolecular forces at play.\n\n5. **Electrical Conductivity**: Covalent compounds typically do not conduct electricity in solid or liquid form because they do not have free-moving charged particles. However, some covalent compounds can conduct electricity when dissolved in water if they ionize (e.g., acids).\n\n### Molecular Networks\n\n1. **Large Repeating Structures**: Molecular networks are extensive structures formed by covalent bonds between atoms. These networks can result in materials with unique properties, such as high strength and stability. For example, diamond has a three-dimensional network of carbon atoms that contributes to its exceptional hardness.\n\n2. **Examples of Molecular Networks**:\n   - **Diamond**: Each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to four other carbon atoms, creating a rigid and strong structure.\n   - **Graphite**: Composed of layers of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, where each layer is held together by weaker van der Waals forces, allowing the layers to slide over each other, which gives graphite its lubricating properties.\n\n3. **Properties of Molecular Networks**: The properties of materials formed from molecular networks can vary widely. For instance, while diamond is extremely hard and has a high melting point, graphite is soft and has a lower melting point due to its layered structure.\n\nIn summary, covalent compounds exhibit a range of characteristics based on their molecular structures, from small discrete molecules to extensive networks, each with distinct physical and chemical properties.
