    What is the role of oxygen in combustion reactions?
answer: >-
    Oxygen plays a crucial role in combustion reactions, which are a specific type of chemical reaction where a substance, typically a hydrocarbon, reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light. The primary products of these reactions are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). \n\nIn a combustion reaction, oxygen acts as an oxidizing agent, facilitating the oxidation of the fuel. This process can be represented by the general equation for the combustion of octane (C8H18), a common component of gasoline:\n\n$$\n\text{2 C}_8\text{H}_{18}(l) + 25 \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 16 \text{CO}_2(g) + 18 \text{H}_2\text{O}(g)\n$$\n\nThis reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy in the form of heat. The presence of oxygen is essential for the combustion process to occur, as it allows for the complete oxidation of the fuel, leading to the efficient release of energy. \n\nIn summary, the role of oxygen in combustion reactions is to act as a reactant that enables the oxidation of fuels, resulting in the production of energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process is fundamental to various applications, including energy production in engines and heating systems.
