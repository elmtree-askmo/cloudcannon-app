    How do you prepare a standard solution for titration?
answer: >-
    To prepare a standard solution for titration, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select a Primary Standard**: Choose a highly pure compound that can be used to prepare a solution with an accurately known concentration. Common examples include sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium dichromate.\n\n2. **Calculate the Required Mass**: Use the formula to determine the mass of the solute needed:\n   $$\n   \text{Number of moles} = \text{Concentration (mol/dm}^3\text{)} \times \text{Volume (dm}^3\text{)}\n   $$\n   For example, if you want to prepare 250 cm³ (0.250 dm³) of a 0.200 mol/dm³ NaOH solution, you would calculate:\n   $$\n   \text{Number of moles} = 0.200 \, \text{mol/dm}^3 \times 0.250 \, \text{dm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{mol}\n   $$\n   Then, calculate the mass using the molar mass of NaOH (approximately 40 g/mol):\n   $$\n   \text{Mass} = \text{Number of moles} \times \text{Molar mass} = 0.050 \, \text{mol} \times 40 \, \text{g/mol} = 2.0 \, \text{g}\n   $$\n\n3. **Weigh the Solute**: Accurately weigh the calculated mass of the primary standard using a balance.\n\n4. **Dissolve the Solute**: Place the weighed solute into a beaker and add a small volume of distilled water. Stir the solution until the solute is completely dissolved.\n\n5. **Transfer to a Volumetric Flask**: Carefully transfer the solution from the beaker to a volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker with distilled water and add the rinsing to the volumetric flask to ensure all solute is transferred.\n\n6. **Make Up to the Mark**: Add distilled water to the volumetric flask until the bottom of the meniscus is at the calibration mark. This ensures that the total volume of the solution is accurate.\n\n7. **Homogenize the Solution**: Stopper the flask and invert it several times to ensure thorough mixing of the solution.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have prepared a standard solution with a known concentration, which is essential for accurate titration results. Remember to always use precise equipment and techniques to ensure the accuracy of your standard solution.
