    Describe the steps involved in balancing a chemical equation.
answer: >-
    Balancing a chemical equation is a systematic process that ensures the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation, in accordance with the law of conservation of mass. Here are the steps involved in balancing a chemical equation:\n\n1. **Write the Unbalanced Equation**: Start by writing the unbalanced chemical equation with the correct formulas for all reactants and products.\n\n2. **Count the Atoms**: Count the number of atoms of each element present in the reactants and products. This will help you identify which elements need to be balanced.\n\n3. **Identify the Most Complex Substance**: Choose a compound that contains the most elements or is the most complex to start balancing. This often simplifies the process.\n\n4. **Balance One Element at a Time**: Adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of the compounds) to balance one element at a time. It is usually best to start with elements that appear in only one reactant and one product.\n\n5. **Balance Hydrogen and Oxygen Last**: If your equation contains hydrogen and oxygen, it is often easier to balance these elements last, as they are commonly found in multiple compounds.\n\n6. **Check for Coefficients in the Simplest Ratio**: Ensure that all coefficients are in the simplest whole-number ratio. If necessary, simplify them.\n\n7. **Recount the Atoms**: After adjusting the coefficients, recount the atoms of each element to ensure that they are balanced on both sides of the equation.\n\n8. **Verify the Balance**: Finally, double-check that the number of atoms for each element is equal on both sides of the equation. If they are not, repeat the previous steps until the equation is balanced.\n\n### Example\nFor instance, to balance the combustion of propane, the unbalanced equation is:\n\n$$\n\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}\n$$\n\nFollowing the steps:\n1. Count the atoms: \n   - Reactants: 3 C, 8 H, and O (unknown)\n   - Products: C (1 in CO₂), H (2 in H₂O), and O (2 in CO₂ + 1 in H₂O)\n\n2. Start balancing:\n   - Balance C: 3 CO₂ (3 C)\n   - Balance H: 4 H₂O (8 H)\n   - Balance O: 5 O₂ (6 from CO₂ + 4 from H₂O)\n\nThe balanced equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3 \text{CO}_2 + 4 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n$$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively balance any chemical equation.
