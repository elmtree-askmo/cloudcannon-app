    What role do naturally occurring isotopes play in determining atomic weight?
answer: >-
    Naturally occurring isotopes play a crucial role in determining the atomic weight of an element. Atomic weight is defined as the weighted average of the masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element, taking into account their relative abundances in nature. This means that the atomic weight reflects not just the mass of the isotopes themselves, but also how common each isotope is.\n\nFor example, chlorine has two stable isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. The atomic weight of chlorine is approximately 35.5 AMU, which is calculated based on the natural abundance of these isotopesâ€”about 75% of chlorine found in nature is chlorine-35, while about 25% is chlorine-37. The calculation for atomic weight can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{(\text{mass of isotope 1} \times \text{abundance of isotope 1}) + (\text{mass of isotope 2} \times \text{abundance of isotope 2})}{100}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the contribution of each isotope to the atomic weight is weighted by its abundance, leading to an atomic weight that is closer to the mass of the more abundant isotope (chlorine-35) than to the less abundant one (chlorine-37).\n\nThis concept is essential for understanding how atomic weights are reported on the periodic table and is particularly important for fields such as chemistry and physics, where precise measurements of atomic properties are necessary. The distinction between atomic mass (the mass of a specific isotope) and atomic weight (the average based on abundance) is vital for mastering these concepts, especially in preparation for exams like the MCAT.
