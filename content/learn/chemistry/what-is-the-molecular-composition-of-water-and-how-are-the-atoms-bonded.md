    What is the molecular composition of water and how are the atoms bonded?
answer: >-
    The molecular composition of water is represented by the chemical formula H₂O, which indicates that each water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. The bonding in water is characterized by polar covalent bonds, where the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms. This difference in electronegativity leads to an unequal sharing of electrons, resulting in a partial negative charge (δ-) on the oxygen atom and partial positive charges (δ+) on the hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe V-shaped molecular structure of water is a consequence of the angle formed between the two hydrogen atoms, which is approximately 104.5 degrees. This geometry contributes to the polarity of the molecule, making water a polar solvent. The polar nature of water allows it to engage in hydrogen bonding, which is the attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atoms of another. These hydrogen bonds are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds but are crucial for many of water's unique properties, such as cohesion, adhesion, and its high heat capacity.\n\nIn summary, water's molecular composition and the nature of its bonding are fundamental to its role as a solvent and its importance in various chemical and biological processes.
