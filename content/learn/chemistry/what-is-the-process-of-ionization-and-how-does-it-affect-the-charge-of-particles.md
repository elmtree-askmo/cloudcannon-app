answer: >-
    Ionization is the process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by adding or removing charged particles, typically electrons. This process can significantly affect the charge of particles, leading to the formation of cations and anions. \n\nWhen an atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion known as a cation. For example, when a neutral sodium atom (Na) loses an electron, it transforms into a sodium ion (Na+), which can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\text{Na}(s) \rightarrow \text{Na}^+(aq) + e^-\n$$\n\nConversely, when an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negatively charged ion known as an anion. For instance, when a chlorine atom (Cl) gains an electron, it becomes a chloride ion (Cl-).\n\nThe charge of an ion is determined by the difference between the number of protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged) in the atom. If an atom has more protons than electrons, it will have a positive charge; if it has more electrons than protons, it will have a negative charge.\n\nIonization is crucial in various chemical reactions and is essential for the formation of ionic compounds. Additionally, ions play vital roles in biological processes, such as nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. The interactions between charged particles, governed by Coulomb's law, dictate how these ions behave in different environments, influencing their reactivity and the nature of chemical reactions they participate in. \n\nIn summary, ionization alters the charge of particles by either adding or removing electrons, leading to the formation of cations and anions, which are fundamental to many chemical and biological processes.
