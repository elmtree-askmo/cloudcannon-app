    How does electron sharing differ between single and double bonds?
answer: >-
    Electron sharing in single and double bonds differs primarily in the number of electron pairs shared between the atoms involved in the bond.\n\n1. **Single Bonds**: A single bond occurs when two atoms share one pair of electrons. This sharing involves one electron from each atom, resulting in a covalent bond that is represented by a single line (e.g., H-H in hydrogen gas). Single bonds allow for free rotation around the bond axis, which can affect the molecular geometry and flexibility of the molecule.\n\n2. **Double Bonds**: A double bond, on the other hand, involves the sharing of two pairs of electrons (or four electrons total) between two atoms. This is represented by two lines connecting the atoms (e.g., O=O in oxygen gas). Double bonds are generally stronger than single bonds due to the increased number of shared electrons, leading to a stronger attraction between the atoms. Additionally, double bonds result in shorter bond lengths compared to single bonds, and they restrict rotation around the bond axis due to the presence of a pi bond in addition to the sigma bond.\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- **Number of Electron Pairs**: Single bonds share one pair, while double bonds share two pairs.\n- **Strength and Length**: Double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds.\n- **Molecular Flexibility**: Single bonds allow for rotation, whereas double bonds do not.\n\nThese differences significantly influence the chemical properties and reactivity of the molecules involved.
