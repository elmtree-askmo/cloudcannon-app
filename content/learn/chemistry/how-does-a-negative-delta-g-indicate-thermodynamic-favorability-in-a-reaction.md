    How does a negative Delta G indicate thermodynamic favorability in a reaction?
answer: >-
    A negative Delta G (ΔG) indicates thermodynamic favorability in a reaction by signifying that the reaction can occur spontaneously without the need for external energy input. The concept of ΔG is rooted in the principles of thermodynamics, where it represents the change in free energy of a system during a chemical reaction.\n\nWhen ΔG is negative, it implies that the products of the reaction have lower free energy than the reactants. This difference in energy means that the reaction can proceed in the forward direction, releasing energy in the process. The relationship between ΔG and the equilibrium constant (K) is given by the equation:\n\n$$\n\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln(K)\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ \Delta G^\circ $ is the standard change in free energy,\n- $ R $ is the universal gas constant,\n- $ T $ is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- $ K $ is the equilibrium constant of the reaction.\n\nIf the equilibrium constant $ K $ is greater than 1, it indicates that the products are favored at equilibrium, leading to a negative ΔG. Conversely, if $ K $ is less than 1, the reaction is not favored, resulting in a positive ΔG.\n\nFor example, the hydrolysis of ATP, which has a ΔG of approximately -30.5 kJ/mol, is a highly favorable reaction that can drive other biochemical processes. This negative ΔG indicates that the reaction releases energy, making it capable of performing work in biological systems.\n\nIn summary, a negative ΔG signifies that a reaction is thermodynamically favorable and can occur spontaneously, contributing to the overall increase in entropy and energy dispersal in the universe.
