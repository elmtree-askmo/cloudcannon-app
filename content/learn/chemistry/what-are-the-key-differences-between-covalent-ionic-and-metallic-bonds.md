    What are the key differences between covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds?
answer: >-
    The key differences between covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Covalent Bonds\n- **Definition**: Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Typically occur between nonmetals.\n  - The shared electrons allow each atom to attain a stable electron configuration, often resembling that of noble gases.\n  - Covalent bonds can be single (one pair of electrons shared), double (two pairs), or triple (three pairs).\n  - They result in the formation of molecules with specific shapes and bond angles due to electron pair repulsion.\n\n### Ionic Bonds\n- **Definition**: Ionic bonds are formed through the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions that attract each other.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Typically occur between metals and nonmetals.\n  - Metals lose electrons to become positively charged cations, while nonmetals gain electrons to become negatively charged anions.\n  - The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms a strong ionic bond.\n  - Ionic compounds tend to form crystalline structures and have high melting and boiling points.\n\n### Metallic Bonds\n- **Definition**: Metallic bonds are characterized by the sharing of delocalized electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Occur between metal atoms.\n  - Electrons are not associated with any specific atom but are free to move throughout the metal structure, creating a "sea of electrons."\n  - This delocalization allows metals to conduct electricity and heat effectively.\n  - Metallic bonds contribute to properties such as malleability, ductility, and luster.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, covalent bonds involve electron sharing between nonmetals, ionic bonds involve electron transfer between metals and nonmetals leading to ionic attraction, and metallic bonds involve a delocalized electron cloud among metal atoms. Each type of bond has distinct properties that influence the physical characteristics of the resulting substances.
