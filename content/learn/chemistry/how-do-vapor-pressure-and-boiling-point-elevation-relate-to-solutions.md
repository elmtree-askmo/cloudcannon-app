    How do vapor pressure and boiling point elevation relate to solutions?
answer: >-
    Vapor pressure and boiling point elevation are closely related concepts in the study of solutions, particularly when a nonvolatile solute is added to a solvent. \n\n1. **Vapor Pressure**: The vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by its vapor when the liquid and vapor are in thermodynamic equilibrium. When a nonvolatile solute is added to a solvent, the vapor pressure of the resulting solution decreases compared to that of the pure solvent. This occurs because the solute particles occupy space at the surface of the liquid, reducing the number of solvent molecules that can escape into the vapor phase.\n\n2. **Boiling Point Elevation**: The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the external atmospheric pressure. Since the addition of a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solvent, a higher temperature is required for the vapor pressure of the solution to reach the atmospheric pressure. Consequently, the boiling point of the solution is elevated compared to that of the pure solvent.\n\nThe relationship between vapor pressure and boiling point elevation can be quantitatively described by the formula:\n\n$$\n\Delta T_b = i K_b m\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $\Delta T_b$ is the change in boiling point,\n- $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (the number of particles the solute dissociates into),\n- $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent,\n- $m$ is the molality of the solute.\n\nThis equation indicates that the extent of boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molality of the solute. As the concentration of the solute increases, the vapor pressure decreases further, necessitating an even higher temperature to achieve boiling.\n\nIn summary, the addition of a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of a solvent, which in turn raises the boiling point of the solution. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of colligative properties, which depend on the number of solute particles in a solution rather than their identity.
