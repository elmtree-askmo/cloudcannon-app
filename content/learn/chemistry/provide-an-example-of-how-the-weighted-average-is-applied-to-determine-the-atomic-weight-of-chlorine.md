    Provide an example of how the weighted average is applied to determine the atomic weight of chlorine.
answer: >-
    To determine the atomic weight of chlorine using the concept of weighted average, we consider its two stable isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. Hereâ€™s how the calculation is performed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Isotopes and Their Atomic Masses**:\n   - Chlorine-35 has an atomic mass of 35 AMU.\n   - Chlorine-37 has an atomic mass of 37 AMU.\n\n2. **Determine the Natural Abundance of Each Isotope**:\n   - Chlorine-35: approximately 75% (or 0.75 as a decimal).\n   - Chlorine-37: approximately 25% (or 0.25 as a decimal).\n\n3. **Calculate the Weighted Average**:\n   The atomic weight can be calculated using the formula for the weighted average:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = (m_1 \cdot a_1) + (m_2 \cdot a_2)\n   $$\n\n   where $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the atomic masses of the isotopes, and $ a_1 $ and $ a_2 $ are their respective abundances.\n\n   Plugging in the values for chlorine:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = (35 \, \text{AMU} \cdot 0.75) + (37 \, \text{AMU} \cdot 0.25)\n   $$\n\n   Performing the calculations:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = 26.25 + 9.25 = 35.5 \, \text{AMU}\n   $$\n\nThus, the atomic weight of chlorine is approximately 35.5 AMU. This value reflects the higher abundance of chlorine-35 compared to chlorine-37, which is why the atomic weight is closer to 35 than to 37.\n\n### Importance of the Weighted Average in Atomic Weight\nUnderstanding the weighted average of atomic weight is crucial for several reasons:\n- It helps predict how elements behave in chemical reactions.\n- Accurate molecular weight calculations are essential for determining molecular formulas.\n- Knowledge of isotopes and their abundances is important in various scientific fields, including radiometric dating and nuclear medicine.\n\nIn summary, the weighted average calculation provides a meaningful representation of the atomic weight of an element, taking into account the natural distribution of its isotopes.
