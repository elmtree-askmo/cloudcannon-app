    How is the topic of investigating matter and properties addressed in the examination?
answer: >-
    In the Ministry of Education Fiji Year 12 Chemistry Examination for 2023, the topic of "Investigating Matter and Properties" is addressed through a structured set of compulsory questions. This section is designed to assess students' understanding of the fundamental concepts related to matter, its properties, and the methods used to investigate these properties.\n\nThe examination format allocates a specific time for this strand, indicating its importance within the overall assessment. For instance, students are expected to spend approximately 36 minutes on questions related to investigating matter, which suggests a focus on both theoretical knowledge and practical application. The questions may cover various aspects, including the classification of matter, physical and chemical properties, and techniques for measuring and analyzing these properties.\n\nStudents are encouraged to demonstrate their understanding by showing their working in calculations and explanations, which is a critical skill in chemistry. This approach not only tests their knowledge but also their ability to apply scientific methods to investigate and interpret the properties of different substances.\n\nOverall, the examination aims to ensure that students are well-prepared to engage with the concepts of matter and its properties, laying a solid foundation for further studies in chemistry and related fields.
