    How is the atomic number of an element determined?
answer: >-
    The atomic number of an element is determined by the number of protons present in the nucleus of its atoms. This fundamental property not only defines the identity of the element but also determines its position in the periodic table. For instance, carbon has an atomic number of 6, indicating that it contains 6 protons in its nucleus. \n\nThe atomic number is crucial because it dictates the chemical properties of the element and influences how it interacts with other elements during chemical reactions. For example, oxygen has an atomic number of 8, meaning it has 8 protons, which contributes to its reactivity and the formation of compounds.\n\nIn summary, the atomic number is a key characteristic of an element, and it is solely determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. This is distinct from the atomic mass, which is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and can vary among isotopes of the same element.
