    How do exothermic and endothermic reactions affect the equilibrium constant when temperature changes?
answer: >-
    The effect of temperature changes on the equilibrium constant (K) for exothermic and endothermic reactions is a fundamental concept in chemical equilibrium. \n\n1. **Exothermic Reactions**: In an exothermic reaction, heat is released as a product. According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the temperature of the system is increased, the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change. Specifically, the increase in temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring the reactants. As a result, the equilibrium constant (K) will decrease. This can be summarized as:\n   - **Increase in Temperature**: Shifts equilibrium left → Decreases K.\n\n2. **Endothermic Reactions**: Conversely, in an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed. When the temperature is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right to favor the formation of products, as the system attempts to absorb the added heat. Consequently, the equilibrium constant (K) will increase. This can be summarized as:\n   - **Increase in Temperature**: Shifts equilibrium right → Increases K.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between temperature and the equilibrium constant is as follows:\n- For exothermic reactions, increasing temperature decreases K.\n- For endothermic reactions, increasing temperature increases K.\n\nThis temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is crucial for predicting the behavior of chemical systems under varying thermal conditions.
