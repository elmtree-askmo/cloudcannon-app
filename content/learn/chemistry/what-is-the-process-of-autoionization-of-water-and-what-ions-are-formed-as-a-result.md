    The auto-ionization of water is a chemical process where one water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to another, resulting in the formation of hydronium and hydroxide ions, essential for understanding acidity and basicity in solutions.

    What is the process of auto-ionization of water and what ions are formed as a result?
answer: >-
    The process of auto-ionization of water is a fundamental chemical reaction that occurs when two water molecules interact. In this process, one water molecule donates a hydrogen ion (H⁺) to another water molecule. This results in the formation of two distinct ions: the hydronium ion (H₃O⁺) and the hydroxide ion (OH⁻). The reaction can be represented by the following equation:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n$$\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Hydronium Ion (H₃O⁺)**: This is a positively charged ion formed when a water molecule gains a hydrogen ion. It is a crucial component in acid-base chemistry, as its concentration determines the acidity of a solution.\n  \n- **Hydroxide Ion (OH⁻)**: This is a negatively charged ion formed when a water molecule loses a hydrogen ion. It plays a significant role in determining the basicity of a solution.\n\n### Concentration of Ions:\nIn pure water at 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of both hydronium ions and hydroxide ions is approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar. This balance of ions is what gives pure water a neutral pH of 7.\n\nThe auto-ionization of water is essential for understanding the behavior of water as both an acid and a base, and it serves as a foundational concept in acid-base chemistry.
