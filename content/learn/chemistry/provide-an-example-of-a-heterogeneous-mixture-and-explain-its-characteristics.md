answer: >-
    An example of a heterogeneous mixture is a salad. In a salad, the individual ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots are visibly distinct and can be easily identified. This characteristic allows for the components to be separated by physical means, such as picking them out by hand or using a strainer.\n\n### Characteristics of Heterogeneous Mixtures:\n\n1. **Visibly Different Components**: The substances in a heterogeneous mixture can be seen as separate entities. In the case of a salad, each ingredient retains its own color, texture, and flavor.\n\n2. **Separation by Physical Means**: The components can be separated using physical methods. For example, you can easily remove the tomatoes from the salad without affecting the other ingredients.\n\n3. **Non-uniform Composition**: Unlike homogeneous mixtures, which have a uniform composition throughout, heterogeneous mixtures have varying compositions in different parts of the mixture. For instance, one bite of salad may contain more cucumbers, while another may have more lettuce.\n\n4. **Distinct Phases**: Heterogeneous mixtures often consist of different phases. For example, in a mixture of oil and water, the oil forms a separate layer on top of the water due to differences in density and polarity.\n\nOther examples of heterogeneous mixtures include a mixture of sand and salt, where the grains of sand and salt can be seen and separated, and a bowl of mixed nuts, where each type of nut is distinguishable from the others.
