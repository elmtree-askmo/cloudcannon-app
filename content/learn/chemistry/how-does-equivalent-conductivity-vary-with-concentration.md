    How does equivalent conductivity vary with concentration?
answer: >-
    Equivalent conductivity, denoted as $ \Lambda $, varies with concentration in a manner that is influenced by the nature of the electrolyte and the degree of ionization. As concentration decreases (or as the solution is diluted), the equivalent conductivity generally increases. This relationship can be understood through several key points:\n\n1. **Definition of Equivalent Conductivity**: Equivalent conductivity is defined as the conductivity of a solution divided by the concentration of the electrolyte in equivalents per liter. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \Lambda = \frac{\kappa}{c}\n   $$\n   where $ \kappa $ is the specific conductance and $ c $ is the concentration in equivalents per liter.\n\n2. **Effect of Dilution**: As the concentration of an electrolyte solution decreases, the number of ions per unit volume also decreases. However, the mobility of the ions increases in very dilute solutions, leading to an increase in equivalent conductivity. This is because, at lower concentrations, ions have more space to move freely, reducing the interactions that can hinder their movement.\n\n3. **Debye-HÃ¼ckel-Onsager Equation**: The relationship between molar conductivity ($ \Lambda_m $) and concentration can be described by the equation:\n   $$\n   \Lambda_m = \Lambda_m^\circ - A C^{1/2}\n   $$\n   where $ \Lambda_m^\circ $ is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution, $ A $ is a constant, and $ C $ is the concentration. This equation indicates that as concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity approaches a constant value, which is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution.\n\n4. **Graphical Representation**: The variation of equivalent conductivity with concentration can be graphically represented, showing that equivalent conductivity increases with dilution. For both strong and weak electrolytes, the equivalent conductivity tends to rise as the solution is diluted.\n\n5. **Ionic Mobility**: The increase in equivalent conductivity with dilution is primarily due to the increased mobility of ions. In concentrated solutions, ions are closer together, leading to increased interactions and reduced mobility. In contrast, in dilute solutions, the reduced ion concentration allows for greater mobility, enhancing conductivity.\n\nIn summary, equivalent conductivity increases as concentration decreases due to the enhanced mobility of ions in dilute solutions, despite the lower number of ions per unit volume. This relationship is crucial for understanding the behavior of electrolytic solutions in various chemical and electrochemical contexts.
