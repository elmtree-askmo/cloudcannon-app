    How is molarity calculated in solution stoichiometry?
answer: >-
    Molarity is a crucial concept in solution stoichiometry, defined as the number of moles of solute present in one liter of solution. The formula for calculating molarity (M) is given by:\n\n$$\nM = \frac{n}{V}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $M$ = molarity of the solution,\n- $n$ = number of moles of the solute,\n- $V$ = volume of the solution in liters.\n\nTo calculate molarity, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of moles of solute**: This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   n = \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{molar mass of solute (g/mol)}}\n   $$\n   For example, if you have 2.00 g of glucose (with a molar mass of approximately 180.18 g/mol), the number of moles would be:\n   $$\n   n = \frac{2.00 \, \text{g}}{180.18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0111 \, \text{mol}\n   $$\n\n2. **Measure the volume of the solution**: Ensure that the volume is in liters. For instance, if the solution volume is 100 mL, convert it to liters:\n   $$\n   V = 100 \, \text{mL} = 0.100 \, \text{L}\n   $$\n\n3. **Calculate molarity**: Substitute the values of $n$ and $V$ into the molarity formula. Continuing with the previous example:\n   $$\n   M = \frac{0.0111 \, \text{mol}}{0.100 \, \text{L}} = 0.111 \, \text{M}\n   $$\n\nThis means the molarity of the glucose solution is 0.111 M.\n\nMolarity is particularly useful in stoichiometric calculations involving chemical reactions in solution, as it allows for the direct conversion between moles of reactants and products based on the balanced chemical equation. For example, if a reaction requires a certain number of moles of a reactant, knowing the molarity of the solution allows you to calculate the volume needed to provide that amount of reactant.
