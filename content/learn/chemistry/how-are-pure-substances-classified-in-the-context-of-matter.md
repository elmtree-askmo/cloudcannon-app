    How are pure substances classified in the context of matter?
answer: >-
    In the context of matter, pure substances are classified into two main categories: elements and compounds. \n\n1. **Elements**: An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Each element is made up of only one type of atom and is represented by a unique chemical symbol. For example, copper (Cu) is an element consisting solely of copper atoms.\n\n2. **Compounds**: A compound is a substance formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. Compounds have distinct properties that differ from the individual elements that compose them. For instance, glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is a compound made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms bonded together.\n\nPure substances are characterized by their uniform and definite composition, which distinguishes them from mixtures. Mixtures consist of two or more substances that are physically combined but not chemically bonded, and they can be separated by physical means. Mixtures can further be classified as homogeneous (uniform composition) or heterogeneous (distinct, separate components).\n\nIn summary, pure substances are classified into elements and compounds, each with unique characteristics and properties that define their role in the classification of matter.
