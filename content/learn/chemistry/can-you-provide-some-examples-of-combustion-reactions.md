answer: >-
    Combustion reactions are a type of chemical reaction where a substance, typically a hydrocarbon, reacts with oxygen gas ($\ce{O_2}$), resulting in the release of energy in the form of heat and light. Here are some examples of combustion reactions:\n\n1. **Combustion of Ethanol**:\n   The combustion of ethanol ($\ce{C_2H_5OH}$) can be represented by the following balanced equation:\n   $$\n   \ce{C2H5OH + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O}\n   $$\n   In this reaction, ethanol reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.\n\n2. **Combustion of Hydrogen**:\n   The combustion of hydrogen gas is another example:\n   $$\n   \ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O}\n   $$\n   Here, hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water vapor.\n\n3. **Combustion of Methane**:\n   Methane ($\ce{CH4}$), a common fuel, undergoes combustion as follows:\n   $$\n   \ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}\n   $$\n   This reaction produces carbon dioxide and water when methane burns in the presence of oxygen.\n\n4. **Combustion of a Wax Candle**:\n   When a wax candle burns, the hydrocarbons in the wax react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The simplified reaction can be represented as:\n   $$\n   \text{Wax} + \ce{O2 -> CO2 + H2O}\n   $$\n\n5. **Combustion of Propane**:\n   Propane ($\ce{C3H8}$) is commonly used in heating and cooking. Its combustion can be represented by:\n   $$\n   \ce{C3H8 + 5O2 -> 3CO2 + 4H2O}\n   $$\n\nThese examples illustrate both complete and incomplete combustion processes, depending on the availability of oxygen. Complete combustion produces carbon dioxide and water, while incomplete combustion can produce carbon monoxide and soot due to insufficient oxygen.
