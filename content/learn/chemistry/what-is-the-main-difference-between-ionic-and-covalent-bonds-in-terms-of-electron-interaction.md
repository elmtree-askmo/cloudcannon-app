    What is the main difference between ionic and covalent bonds in terms of electron interaction?
answer: >-
    The main difference between ionic and covalent bonds in terms of electron interaction lies in how electrons are handled between the atoms involved in the bonding process.\n\n1. **Ionic Bonds**:\n   - Ionic bonds are formed through the **transfer of electrons** from one atom to another. This typically occurs between metals and non-metals. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na) donates one electron to chlorine (Cl). As a result, sodium becomes a positively charged ion (Na⁺), while chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl⁻). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond. This type of bond emphasizes the creation of ions through electron transfer.\n\n2. **Covalent Bonds**:\n   - In contrast, covalent bonds involve the **sharing of electrons** between atoms. This sharing allows each atom to attain a stable electron configuration, often filling their valence shells. For instance, in a water molecule (H₂O), each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds. Covalent bonding can vary in strength and can be classified into single, double, or triple bonds based on the number of shared electron pairs.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that ionic bonds result from the transfer of electrons and the formation of charged ions, while covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between atoms. This fundamental difference influences the properties and behaviors of the compounds formed by these types of bonds.
