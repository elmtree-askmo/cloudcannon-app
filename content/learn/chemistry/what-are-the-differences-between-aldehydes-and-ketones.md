    What are the differences between aldehydes and ketones?
answer: >-
    Aldehydes and ketones are both classes of organic compounds that contain a carbonyl group (C=O), but they differ significantly in their structure, reactivity, and nomenclature. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Chemical Structure**:\n   - **Aldehydes** have the general formula R-CHO, where the carbonyl group is located at the end of the carbon chain. This means that at least one of the bonds to the carbonyl carbon is a hydrogen atom.\n   - **Ketones**, on the other hand, have the general formula R-CO-R', where the carbonyl group is situated between two carbon atoms, meaning it is bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups.\n\n2. **Reactivity**:\n   - Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones. They can be easily oxidized to form carboxylic acids. In contrast, ketones are resistant to oxidation and cannot be oxidized without breaking the carbon chain.\n\n3. **Nomenclature**:\n   - In terms of naming, aldehydes typically end with the suffix "-al" (e.g., propanal for a three-carbon aldehyde), while ketones use the suffix "-one" (e.g., propanone for a three-carbon ketone).\n\n4. **Chemical Tests**:\n   - Aldehydes can be distinguished from ketones using specific chemical tests. For example, Tollen's test and Fehling's test will yield positive results for aldehydes but not for ketones. This is due to the higher reactivity of aldehydes.\n\n5. **Physical Properties**:\n   - Both aldehydes and ketones can form hydrogen bonds with water, but aldehydes tend to have higher boiling points than ketones of similar molecular weight due to the presence of the hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n\nIn summary, while both aldehydes and ketones contain a carbonyl group, they differ in their structural placement, reactivity, naming conventions, and some physical properties. These distinctions are crucial for understanding their behavior in chemical reactions and their applications in organic chemistry.
