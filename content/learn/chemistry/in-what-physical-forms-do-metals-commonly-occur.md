    In what physical forms do metals commonly occur?
answer: >-
    Metals commonly occur in solid physical forms at room temperature, with a few exceptions. The majority of metals are characterized by their shiny appearance, high density, and good conductivity of heat and electricity. Here are some key points regarding the physical forms of metals:\n\n1. **Solid State**: Most metals exist as solids at room temperature. This includes common metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and lead. They exhibit properties such as hardness and malleability, allowing them to be shaped without breaking.\n\n2. **Liquid State**: A notable exception is mercury, which is a metal that remains liquid at room temperature. Another example is gallium, which can also be liquid near room temperature.\n\n3. **Alloys**: Metals can also occur in the form of alloys, which are mixtures of two or more metals (or a metal and a non-metal) that have enhanced properties compared to the individual metals. Examples include bronze (copper and tin) and steel (iron and carbon).\n\n4. **Varied Properties**: While most metals are hard and solid, some, like sodium and potassium, are softer and can be cut with a knife. The physical properties of metals can vary significantly, including differences in density, melting points, and hardness.\n\n5. **Classification**: Metals are further classified into groups such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and post-transition metals, each exhibiting distinct physical characteristics.\n\nIn summary, metals primarily occur in solid forms, with the exception of a few that are liquid at room temperature, and they can also be found as alloys, which combine the properties of different metals.
