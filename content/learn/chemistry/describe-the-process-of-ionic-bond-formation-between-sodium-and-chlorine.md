answer: >-
    The process of ionic bond formation between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) involves the transfer of electrons, resulting in the creation of charged ions that attract each other due to their opposite charges. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Electron Configuration**:\n   - Sodium (Na) has the electron configuration of $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1$, indicating that it has one valence electron in the third energy level.\n   - Chlorine (Cl) has the electron configuration of $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^5$, which shows it has seven valence electrons in the third energy level.\n\n2. **Valence Electrons**:\n   - Sodium, being in Group 1 of the periodic table, has one valence electron. It is highly reactive and tends to lose this electron to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of the noble gas neon.\n   - Chlorine, located in Group 7, has seven valence electrons and is also very reactive. It tends to gain one electron to complete its octet, achieving a stable electron configuration similar to that of the noble gas argon.\n\n3. **Electron Transfer**:\n   - During the ionic bond formation, sodium loses its one valence electron, resulting in the formation of a sodium cation ($ \text{Na}^+ $). This loss of an electron gives sodium a positive charge.\n   - Chlorine, on the other hand, gains the electron that sodium has lost, forming a chloride anion ($ \text{Cl}^- $). This gain of an electron gives chlorine a negative charge.\n\n4. **Formation of Ionic Bond**:\n   - The resulting sodium cation ($ \text{Na}^+ $) and chloride anion ($ \text{Cl}^- $) are now oppositely charged ions. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions leads to the formation of an ionic bond.\n   - The compound formed as a result of this ionic bond is sodium chloride ($ \text{NaCl} $), commonly known as table salt.\n\n5. **Stability**:\n   - The formation of $ \text{NaCl} $ results in a stable ionic compound, where the arrangement of ions in a crystal lattice maximizes the attractive forces between the cations and anions while minimizing repulsive forces.\n\nIn summary, the ionic bond between sodium and chlorine is formed through the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine, resulting in the formation of $ \text{Na}^+ $ and $ \text{Cl}^- $, which are held together by the strong electrostatic forces of attraction. This process exemplifies the reactivity of alkali metals and halogens, leading to the formation of stable ionic compounds.
