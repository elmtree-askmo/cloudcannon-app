    The difference between acidic and basic solutions is primarily defined by their pH values, with acidic solutions having a pH less than 7 and basic solutions having a pH greater than 7. This foundational knowledge is critical across various scientific disciplines.

    What distinguishes acidic solutions from basic solutions in terms of pH values?
answer: >-
    Acidic solutions are distinguished from basic solutions primarily by their pH values, which are measured on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0 to 14. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **pH Values**:\n   - **Acidic Solutions**: These have a pH value less than 7. This indicates a higher concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) compared to hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n   - **Basic (Alkaline) Solutions**: These have a pH value greater than 7, indicating a higher concentration of hydroxide ions than hydronium ions.\n\n2. **Neutral Solution**: A pH of exactly 7 is considered neutral, which is the case for pure water at 25 degrees Celsius.\n\n3. **Logarithmic Nature of pH**: The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than one with a pH of 5.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **Stomach Acid**: Typically has a low pH (around 1-3), making it highly acidic.\n   - **Seawater**: Generally has a pH around 8, indicating it is slightly basic.\n   - **Bleach**: Often has a high pH (around 12-13), classifying it as strongly basic.\n\nIn summary, the distinction between acidic and basic solutions is fundamentally based on their pH values, which reflect the relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in the solution. This understanding is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science.
