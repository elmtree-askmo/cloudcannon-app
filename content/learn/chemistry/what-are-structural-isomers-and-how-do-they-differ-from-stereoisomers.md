    Structural isomers differ in the connectivity of their atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement. This distinction is important in organic chemistry.

    What are structural isomers and how do they differ from stereoisomers?
answer: >-
    Structural isomers and stereoisomers are two distinct types of isomerism in chemistry, particularly relevant in organic chemistry.\n\n**Structural Isomers** (also known as constitutional isomers) are compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity of their atoms. This means that the atoms are arranged in a completely different order, leading to different structural arrangements. For example, the molecular formula C₄H₁₀ can represent both butane and 2-methylpropane, which are structural isomers. Structural isomers can have vastly different physical and chemical properties due to their distinct arrangements. They can be further classified into various types, such as chain isomerism, where the carbon skeleton differs, and functional group isomerism, where the functional groups are arranged differently.\n\n**Stereoisomers**, on the other hand, have the same connectivity of atoms but differ in their spatial arrangement in three-dimensional space. This means that while the atoms are connected in the same order, their orientation in space is different. Stereoisomers can be further categorized into enantiomers (which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other) and diastereomers (which are not mirror images). An example of stereoisomers is the two forms of butene: 1-butene and 2-butene, which have the same molecular formula but differ in the position of the double bond.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the arrangement of atoms: structural isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers maintain the same connectivity but differ in their spatial orientation.
