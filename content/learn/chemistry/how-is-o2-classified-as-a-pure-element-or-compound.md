    How is O2 classified as a pure element or compound?
answer: >-
    Oxygen, in its most common form as a diatomic molecule represented as O2, is classified as a pure element. This classification is based on the definition of elements and compounds in chemistry. An element is a pure substance made up of only one type of atom, while a compound consists of two or more different elements that are chemically combined in fixed proportions.\n\nSince O2 consists of two identical oxygen atoms, it meets the criteria for being a pure element. It is not a mixture, and because it is homogeneous (having the same composition throughout), it is classified as a pure substance. Other examples of pure elements include hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), and noble gases like helium (He).\n\nIn contrast, compounds are formed when different elements combine chemically. For example, water (H2O) is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen in a specific ratio. Therefore, O2 is not a compound but rather a pure element, specifically a diatomic molecule of oxygen.
