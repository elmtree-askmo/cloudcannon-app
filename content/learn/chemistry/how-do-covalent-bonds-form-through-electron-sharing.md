    How do covalent bonds form through electron sharing?
answer: >-
    Covalent bonds form through the sharing of valence electrons between two non-metal atoms. This type of bonding is characterized by the mutual attraction of the shared electrons, which allows each atom to achieve a more stable electron configuration. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this process works:\n\n1. **Valence Electrons**: Atoms have outermost electrons known as valence electrons, which are crucial in determining how they bond with other atoms. The number of valence electrons influences an atom's reactivity and the types of bonds it can form.\n\n2. **Electron Sharing**: In covalent bonding, two atoms share one or more pairs of their valence electrons. For example, in a chlorine molecule (Cl2), each chlorine atom has seven valence electrons. By sharing one electron from each atom, they both achieve a full outer shell of eight electrons, which is a stable configuration.\n\n3. **Formation of Molecules**: The shared electrons create a strong bond between the atoms, resulting in the formation of discrete molecules. This can be seen in other examples such as ammonia (NH3), where nitrogen shares electrons with three hydrogen atoms.\n\n4. **Covalent Networks**: In some cases, covalent bonds can lead to the formation of extensive networks, such as in graphite. Here, carbon atoms are bonded in a repeating structure, creating a large, stable network.\n\n5. **Characteristics of Covalent Bonds**:\n   - They can form simple molecules (like H2 or Cl2) or complex structures (like graphite).\n   - The bond strength and stability depend on the number of shared electron pairs; for instance, a double bond involves sharing two pairs of electrons, which is stronger than a single bond.\n\nIn summary, covalent bonds are formed through the sharing of valence electrons, allowing atoms to achieve stability and resulting in the creation of various molecular structures. This process is fundamental to the chemistry of non-metals and plays a significant role in the properties of substances formed through covalent bonding.
