    What are the electronic configurations of lanthanoids?
answer: >-
    The electronic configurations of the lanthanoids, which are the series of elements from lanthanum (La) to lutetium (Lu), can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **General Configuration**: The general electronic configuration for the lanthanides is given by:\n   $$\n   [Xe] 4f^{1-14} 5d^{0-1} 6s^2\n   $$\n   This indicates that the 4f orbitals are progressively filled from 4f¹ to 4f¹⁴, while the 5d orbitals can hold up to one electron, and the 6s orbital is fully filled with two electrons.\n\n2. **Specific Cases**:\n   - **Lanthanum (La)**: The electronic configuration is [Xe] 5d¹ 6s², as it is the first element in the series and has one electron in the 5d orbital.\n   - **Cerium (Ce)**: The configuration is [Xe] 4f¹ 5d¹ 6s², indicating that it has one electron in both the 4f and 5d orbitals.\n   - **Gadolinium (Gd)**: The configuration is [Xe] 4f⁷ 5d¹ 6s², notable for having a half-filled 4f subshell.\n   - **Lutetium (Lu)**: The configuration is [Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹ 6s², where the 4f subshell is completely filled.\n\n3. **Promethium (Pm)**: This element, with atomic number 61, is unique as it is the only synthetic radioactive lanthanoid, and its electronic configuration is [Xe] 4f¹ 5d⁰ 6s².\n\nThe filling of the 4f and 5d orbitals is influenced by the close energy levels of these subshells, which can lead to exceptions in the expected configurations for certain elements. Overall, the lanthanides exhibit similar electronic configurations, which contribute to their comparable chemical properties.
