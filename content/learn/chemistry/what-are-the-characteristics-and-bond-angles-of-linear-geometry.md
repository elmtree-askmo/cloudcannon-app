    What are the characteristics and bond angles of linear geometry?
answer: >-
    Linear geometry is a fundamental concept in VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, which helps predict the shape of molecules based on the repulsion between electron groups around a central atom. Here are the key characteristics and bond angles associated with linear geometry:\n\n### Characteristics of Linear Geometry:\n1. **Electron Groups**: Linear geometry occurs when there are two electron groups (bonding pairs or lone pairs) around a central atom.\n2. **Hybridization**: The hybridization associated with linear geometry is **sp**. This involves the mixing of one s orbital and one p orbital to form two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals.\n3. **Molecular Shape**: In a linear arrangement, the atoms are positioned at opposite ends of the central atom, creating a straight line.\n4. **Examples**: Common examples of molecules with linear geometry include carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\n### Bond Angles:\n- The bond angle in linear geometry is **180 degrees**. This angle results from the arrangement of the two electron groups, which are positioned as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, linear geometry is characterized by:\n- **Electron Groups**: 2\n- **Hybridization**: sp\n- **Bond Angle**: 180 degrees\n- **Examples**: CO₂, HCl\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is essential for predicting the molecular structure and behavior of linear molecules in chemical reactions and interactions.
