    What are the steps and rules for writing formulas for ionic compounds?
answer: >-
    To write formulas for ionic compounds, you can follow these steps and rules:\n\n1. **Identify the Ions**: Determine the cation (positively charged ion) and the anion (negatively charged ion) involved in the compound. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium (Na⁺) is the cation and chloride (Cl⁻) is the anion.\n\n2. **Know the Charges**: Understand the charges of the ions. This is crucial as the total positive charge must balance the total negative charge in the compound. For instance, sodium has a charge of +1, while chloride has a charge of -1.\n\n3. **Use the Criss-Cross Method**: This method helps in balancing the charges. Write the charge of the cation as a subscript for the anion and the charge of the anion as a subscript for the cation. For example, if you have calcium (Ca²⁺) and nitrate (NO₃⁻), you would write the formula as Ca(NO₃)₂, indicating that two nitrate ions are needed to balance the charge of one calcium ion.\n\n4. **Combine the Ions**: Write the formula by placing the cation first followed by the anion. If the anion is a polyatomic ion (like sulfate or nitrate), keep it intact. For example, for potassium (K⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻), the formula would be K₂SO₄.\n\n5. **Use Parentheses for Multiple Polyatomic Ions**: If more than one polyatomic ion is needed, enclose the polyatomic ion in parentheses and place the subscript outside. For example, in aluminum sulfate, which contains two sulfate ions, the formula is Al₂(SO₄)₃.\n\n6. **Final Check**: Ensure that the overall charge of the compound is neutral. The total positive charge from the cations should equal the total negative charge from the anions.\n\n### Example:\nFor the compound formed from calcium and nitrate:\n- Calcium ion: Ca²⁺\n- Nitrate ion: NO₃⁻\nUsing the criss-cross method, you would write:\n- The formula becomes Ca(NO₃)₂, indicating that one calcium ion balances with two nitrate ions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately write the formulas for both binary ionic compounds and those containing polyatomic ions.
