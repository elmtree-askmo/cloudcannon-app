    What is the typical hardness of metalloids?
answer: >-
    Metalloids exhibit a diverse range of hardness levels, which can be measured using the Mohs hardness scale. For instance, arsenic has a Mohs hardness value of 3.5, indicating it is relatively soft compared to many other materials. In contrast, boron is significantly harder, with a Mohs hardness value of 9.3, making it one of the hardest metalloids. \n\nThis variability in hardness among metalloids is notable when compared to other elements; for example, diamond, which is a form of carbon, has a Mohs hardness of 10, while gold has a hardness of only 2.5. The hardness of metalloids can be influenced by their ability to form alloys with metals, which can enhance their overall strength and hardness.\n\nIn summary, the typical hardness of metalloids varies widely, with some like arsenic being relatively soft and others like boron being quite hard. This characteristic contributes to their unique applications in various fields, including electronics and materials science.
