    Describe the characteristics and examples of single, double, and triple bonds.
answer: >-
    Single, double, and triple bonds are types of covalent bonds that involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, primarily nonmetals. Here’s a detailed description of each type, including their characteristics and examples:\n\n### Single Bonds\n- **Definition**: A single bond occurs when two atoms share one pair of electrons (two electrons total).\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Represented by a single line (e.g., H-H or C-H).\n  - Atoms connected by a single bond can freely rotate around the bond axis.\n  - Generally longer and weaker than double and triple bonds.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Hydrogen molecule (H₂): Each hydrogen atom shares one electron.\n  - Methane (CH₄): Each hydrogen atom forms a single bond with the carbon atom.\n\n### Double Bonds\n- **Definition**: A double bond forms when two atoms share two pairs of electrons (four electrons total).\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Represented by two lines (e.g., O=O or C=C).\n  - Shorter and stronger than single bonds due to the increased electron sharing.\n  - Limited rotation around the bond axis compared to single bonds.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Oxygen molecule (O₂): Each oxygen atom shares two electrons.\n  - Ethylene (C₂H₄): Each carbon atom forms a double bond with the other carbon atom.\n\n### Triple Bonds\n- **Definition**: A triple bond occurs when two atoms share three pairs of electrons (six electrons total).\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Represented by three lines (e.g., N≡N or C≡C).\n  - Shorter and stronger than both single and double bonds, making them very stable.\n  - No rotation around the bond axis, leading to a fixed orientation of the bonded atoms.\n- **Examples**:\n  - Nitrogen molecule (N₂): Each nitrogen atom shares three electrons.\n  - Acetylene (C₂H₂): Each carbon atom forms a triple bond with the other carbon atom.\n\n### Comparison of Bonds\n- **Strength**: Triple bonds > Double bonds > Single bonds (in terms of bond strength).\n- **Length**: Single bonds > Double bonds > Triple bonds (in terms of bond length).\n- **Rotation**: Single bonds allow free rotation, while double and triple bonds restrict rotation due to their multiple electron sharing.\n\nIn summary, the type of bond formed between atoms significantly influences the properties of the resulting molecules, including their geometry, reactivity, and physical characteristics.
