    Explain the process of writing the electron configuration for sodium.
answer: >-
    To write the electron configuration for sodium (Na), which has an atomic number of 11, we need to account for all 11 electrons in the appropriate orbitals according to the principles of electron configuration.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Electrons**: Sodium has 11 electrons.\n\n2. **Determine the Energy Levels and Orbitals**:\n   - The first two electrons will fill the 1s orbital.\n   - The next two electrons will fill the 2s orbital.\n   - The following six electrons will fill the 2p orbital.\n\n3. **Filling the Orbitals**:\n   - The 1s orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons: \n     - Configuration: 1s²\n   - The 2s orbital can also hold a maximum of 2 electrons:\n     - Configuration: 2s²\n   - The 2p orbital can hold a maximum of 6 electrons, and since we have 6 electrons to place here:\n     - Configuration: 2p⁶\n   - Finally, we have 1 electron left to place in the 3s orbital:\n     - Configuration: 3s¹\n\n4. **Complete Electron Configuration**:\n   - Combining all these, the complete electron configuration for sodium is:\n   $$\n   1s^2 \, 2s^2 \, 2p^6 \, 3s^1\n   $$\n\n5. **Shorthand Notation**:\n   - The shorthand notation for sodium can be written using the nearest noble gas preceding it, which is neon (Ne). Thus, the shorthand electron configuration is:\n   $$\n   [Ne] \, 3s^1\n   $$\n\n### Summary:\nThe complete electron configuration for sodium is $1s^2 \, 2s^2 \, 2p^6 \, 3s^1$, and the shorthand notation is $[Ne] \, 3s^1$. This configuration indicates that sodium has one valence electron in the 3s orbital, which plays a crucial role in its chemical reactivity and properties.
