    What is the definition of a combustion reaction?
answer: >-
    A combustion reaction is defined as a chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas ($\ce{O_2}$), resulting in the release of energy in the form of light and heat. This type of reaction is typically exothermic, meaning it releases energy, and is commonly associated with the burning of fuels. \n\nIn general, combustion reactions can be represented by the following equation:\n\n$$\n\text{Fuel} + \ce{O_2} \rightarrow \text{Products} + \text{Energy}\n$$\n\nA classic example of a combustion reaction is the burning of hydrogen gas, which produces water vapor:\n\n$$\n2 \ce{H2(g)} + \ce{O2(g)} \rightarrow 2 \ce{H2O(g)}\n$$\n\nCombustion reactions can be categorized into two main types: complete combustion and incomplete combustion. Complete combustion occurs when there is a sufficient supply of oxygen, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and water. In contrast, incomplete combustion happens when there is insufficient oxygen, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide or soot along with water.\n\nOverall, combustion reactions are significant in various applications, including energy production, internal combustion engines, and heating systems.
