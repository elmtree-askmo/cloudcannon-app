    To calculate the cell potential (E_cell) of a galvanic cell, you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\nE_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Calculate E_cell:\n\n1. **Identify the Half-Reactions**: Determine the oxidation and reduction half-reactions occurring in the galvanic cell. The oxidation half-reaction occurs at the anode, while the reduction half-reaction occurs at the cathode.\n\n2. **Find Standard Reduction Potentials (E°)**: Look up the standard reduction potentials for both half-reactions in a standard reduction potential table. These values are typically given in volts (V).\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Substitute the standard reduction potentials into the formula:\n   - $ E_{cathode} $ is the standard reduction potential of the reduction half-reaction.\n   - $ E_{anode} $ is the standard reduction potential of the oxidation half-reaction (note that this value is used as a negative in the calculation since it represents the reverse reaction).\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nFor a Daniell cell, which consists of a zinc electrode (anode) and a copper electrode (cathode), the half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials are as follows:\n\n- **Oxidation at Anode**: \n  $$ \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Zn} \quad (E° = -0.76 \, \text{V}) $$\n  \n- **Reduction at Cathode**: \n  $$ \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \quad (E° = +0.34 \, \text{V}) $$\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n$$\nE_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode} = (+0.34 \, \text{V}) - (-0.76 \, \text{V}) = +0.34 \, \text{V} + 0.76 \, \text{V} = +1.10 \, \text{V}\n$$\n\nThus, the cell potential for the Daniell cell is +1.10 V, indicating a spontaneous reaction.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe cell potential (E_cell) is a crucial indicator of the driving force behind the electron flow in a galvanic cell. A positive E_cell value signifies that the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.
