    What is a base 10 logarithm and why is it important in pH calculations?
answer: >-
    A base 10 logarithm, often denoted as $\log(x)$ or $\log_{10}(x)$, is a logarithmic function where the base is 10. This means that the base 10 logarithm of a number $x$ is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to obtain that number. For example, $\log_{10}(100) = 2$ because $10^2 = 100$. \n\n### Importance in pH Calculations\n\nIn the context of chemistry, particularly in pH calculations, the base 10 logarithm plays a crucial role. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n$$\n\nThis equation indicates that as the concentration of hydrogen ions increases, the pH value decreases, making the solution more acidic. Conversely, a lower concentration of hydrogen ions results in a higher pH value, indicating a more basic or alkaline solution.\n\n### Rearranging the pH Equation\n\nTo find the hydrogen ion concentration from a given pH value, the equation can be rearranged as follows:\n\n1. Start with the pH definition:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n   $$\n\n2. Multiply both sides by -1:\n   $$\n   -\text{pH} = \log_{10} [H^+]\n   $$\n\n3. Apply the inverse of the logarithm (which is exponentiation) to both sides:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n   $$\n\nThis rearrangement allows chemists to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration directly from the pH value, which is essential for understanding the acidity or basicity of a solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe base 10 logarithm is fundamental in pH calculations because it provides a convenient way to express the concentration of hydrogen ions in a logarithmic scale, which is more manageable given the wide range of hydrogen ion concentrations encountered in various solutions. This logarithmic relationship simplifies the understanding and communication of acidity and basicity in chemical contexts.
