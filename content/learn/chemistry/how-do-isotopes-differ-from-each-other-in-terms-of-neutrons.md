    How do isotopes differ from each other in terms of neutrons?
answer: >-
    Isotopes differ from each other primarily in the number of neutrons they contain. While isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons, which defines the element itself, they vary in their neutron count. This difference in neutrons leads to variations in atomic mass.\n\nFor example, consider the element carbon. The most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Another isotope, carbon-14, has the same number of protons (6) but has 8 neutrons. This difference in neutron number results in carbon-14 being heavier than carbon-12.\n\nThe presence of different isotopes can have significant implications. Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14, can be used in various applications, including carbon dating in archaeology and as tracers in medical imaging.\n\nIn summary, isotopes are variants of the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, leading to differences in atomic mass and stability.
