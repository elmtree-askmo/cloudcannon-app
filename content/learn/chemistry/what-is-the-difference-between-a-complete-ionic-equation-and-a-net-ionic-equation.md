    What is the difference between a complete ionic equation and a net ionic equation?
answer: >-
    The difference between a complete ionic equation and a net ionic equation lies in the representation of the ions involved in a chemical reaction.\n\n1. **Complete Ionic Equation**: This equation includes all the ions present in the reaction, including both the ions that participate in the reaction (reactants that form products) and the spectator ions (ions that do not change during the reaction). For example, in the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride, the complete ionic equation is:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Ag}^+ (aq) + \text{NO}_3^- (aq) + \text{Na}^+ (aq) + \text{Cl}^- (aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl} (s) + \text{Na}^+ (aq) + \text{NO}_3^- (aq)\n   $$\n\n   Here, all ions are shown, including the sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and nitrate ions ($\text{NO}_3^-$), which do not participate in the formation of the precipitate.\n\n2. **Net Ionic Equation**: This equation is derived from the complete ionic equation by removing the spectator ions, thus focusing only on the ions that participate in the reaction. For the same reaction, the net ionic equation is:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Ag}^+ (aq) + \text{Cl}^- (aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl} (s)\n   $$\n\n   This equation highlights the actual chemical change occurring, which is the formation of the precipitate silver chloride ($\text{AgCl}$).\n\nIn summary, the complete ionic equation provides a full picture of all ions in the reaction, while the net ionic equation emphasizes the ions that are directly involved in the chemical change.
