    How is a decomposition reaction generally represented in chemical equations?
answer: >-
    A decomposition reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. This process typically requires an input of energy, which can be in the form of heat, light, or electricity. \n\nThe general representation of a decomposition reaction in chemical equations is as follows:\n\n$$\n\ce{AB} \rightarrow \ce{A} + \ce{B}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $AB$ represents the reactant (the compound that is decomposing), while $A$ and $B$ are the products formed from the decomposition. The arrow indicates the direction of the reaction, showing that the reactant breaks down into the products.\n\nFor example, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation:\n\n$$\n2 \ce{H2O2} \rightarrow 2 \ce{H2O} + \ce{O2}\n$$\n\nThis illustrates how one compound (hydrogen peroxide) decomposes into two products (water and oxygen gas). Decomposition reactions are essential in various chemical processes and can occur through different mechanisms, including thermal decomposition and electrolytic decomposition.
