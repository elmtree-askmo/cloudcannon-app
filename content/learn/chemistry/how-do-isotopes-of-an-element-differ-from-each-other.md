    Isotopes of an element differ in the number of neutrons they have, resulting in different atomic masses and stability. This difference is crucial in applications like radiocarbon dating and medical imaging.

    How do isotopes of an element differ from each other?
answer: >-
    Isotopes of an element differ from each other primarily in the number of neutrons they contain. While all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons (which defines the element), the variation in the number of neutrons leads to differences in their atomic masses. \n\nFor example, carbon has several isotopes, including carbon-12 (with 6 protons and 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (with 6 protons and 8 neutrons). Both isotopes are carbon, but carbon-14 is radioactive and is commonly used in radiocarbon dating, while carbon-12 is stable.\n\nThe differences in neutron numbers can result in different physical properties, such as stability. Some isotopes are stable, meaning they do not change over time, while others are radioactive and decay into other elements or isotopes over time. This decay process can be harnessed for various applications, including medical imaging and treatment, as well as in scientific research.\n\nIn summary, isotopes of an element differ in:\n1. The number of neutrons.\n2. Their atomic masses.\n3. Their stability (some are stable, while others are radioactive). \n\nThese differences are significant in fields such as biochemistry, medicine, and environmental science, where isotopes can be used as tracers or in dating techniques.
