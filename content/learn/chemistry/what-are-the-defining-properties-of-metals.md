    What are the defining properties of metals?
answer: >-
    Metals are a class of substances characterized by several defining properties that distinguish them from non-metals and metalloids. Here are the key properties of metals:\n\n1. **Luster**: Metals typically have a shiny appearance when cut, scratched, or polished. This reflective quality is due to their ability to reflect light effectively.\n\n2. **Malleability**: Metals are malleable, meaning they can be easily bent, shaped, or hammered into thin sheets without breaking. This property allows for the creation of various metal forms and structures.\n\n3. **Ductility**: Metals can be drawn into wires without breaking, which is a crucial property for many applications, such as electrical wiring.\n\n4. **Conductivity**: Metals are excellent conductors of both electricity and heat. This high conductivity is due to the presence of free-moving electrons within the metal structure.\n\n5. **Strength**: Metals are generally strong and can withstand significant stress and strain. This strength varies among different metals, with some being more suitable for construction and engineering applications.\n\n6. **High Density**: Most metals have a high density, which contributes to their strength and durability.\n\n7. **Chemical Reactivity**: Metals tend to lose electrons and form positive ions during chemical reactions. They often react with oxygen to form metal oxides, which are typically basic in nature.\n\n8. **Thermal Conductivity**: Metals can efficiently transfer heat, making them ideal for applications that require heat exchange.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of all known chemical elements are metals, with common examples including aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These properties make metals essential in various industrial applications, from construction to electronics.
