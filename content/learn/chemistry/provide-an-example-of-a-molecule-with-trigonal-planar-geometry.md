answer: >-
    An example of a molecule with trigonal planar geometry is boron trifluoride (BF3). In this molecule, the boron atom serves as the central atom and is surrounded by three fluorine atoms. The arrangement of these atoms forms a flat, triangular shape, with bond angles of approximately 120 degrees. This geometry arises because the boron atom has three electron groups (the three B-F bonds) and no lone pairs, leading to the minimization of electron pair repulsion as described by VSEPR theory. \n\nIn summary, BF3 exemplifies trigonal planar geometry due to its three bonding pairs and the absence of lone pairs around the central boron atom.
