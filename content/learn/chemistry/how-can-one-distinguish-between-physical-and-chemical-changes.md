    How can one distinguish between physical and chemical changes?
answer: >-
    To distinguish between physical and chemical changes, one must consider whether a new substance is formed during the process. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Physical Change**: A change that alters the form or appearance of a substance but does not change its chemical composition. Examples include melting, freezing, boiling, and shredding. For instance, when ice melts into water, its state changes, but it remains Hâ‚‚O.\n   - **Chemical Change**: A change that results in the formation of one or more new substances with different chemical properties. This involves the rearrangement of atoms and breaking of chemical bonds. Examples include burning, rusting, and cooking. For example, when wood burns, it transforms into ash, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, which are new substances.\n\n2. **Indicators**:\n   - **Physical Changes**: Look for changes in state (solid, liquid, gas), shape, or size without any alteration in the chemical identity. The original substance can typically be recovered.\n   - **Chemical Changes**: Indicators include color change, gas production (bubbles), temperature change, and the formation of a precipitate (solid). If a new substance is produced that cannot be easily reverted to the original, it is likely a chemical change.\n\n3. **Reversibility**:\n   - **Physical Changes**: Often reversible (e.g., freezing and melting of water).\n   - **Chemical Changes**: Generally not reversible by simple physical means (e.g., once wood is burned, it cannot be turned back into wood).\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction lies in the formation of new substances. If a new substance is created, it is a chemical change; if the substance retains its original chemical identity, it is a physical change.
