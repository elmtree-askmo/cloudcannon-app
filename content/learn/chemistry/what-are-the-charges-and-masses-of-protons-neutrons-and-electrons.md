    What are the charges and masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons?
answer: >-
    The charges and masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons are fundamental to understanding atomic structure. Here are the details:\n\n### Charges\n- **Protons**: Protons carry a positive charge of +1 elementary charge (approximately +1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs).\n- **Neutrons**: Neutrons are neutral particles and carry no charge (0).\n- **Electrons**: Electrons carry a negative charge of -1 elementary charge (approximately -1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs).\n\n### Masses\n- **Protons**: The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 atomic mass units (amu), which is about 1.6726 x 10^-27 kg.\n- **Neutrons**: The mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 amu, which is about 1.6750 x 10^-27 kg.\n- **Electrons**: The mass of an electron is significantly smaller, approximately 0.00054858 amu, which is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kg.\n\n### Summary\n- **Proton**: Charge = +1, Mass ≈ 1.007276 amu\n- **Neutron**: Charge = 0, Mass ≈ 1.008665 amu\n- **Electron**: Charge = -1, Mass ≈ 0.00054858 amu\n\nThese properties are crucial for understanding the behavior of atoms, their interactions, and the formation of chemical bonds.
