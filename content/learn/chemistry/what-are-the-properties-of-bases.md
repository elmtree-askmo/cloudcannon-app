    What are the properties of bases?
answer: >-
    In chemistry, bases are substances that exhibit several characteristic properties, which often contrast with those of acids. Here are the key properties of bases:\n\n1. **Taste and Texture**: Bases typically have a bitter taste and feel slippery to the touch. This slippery sensation is often associated with substances like soaps.\n\n2. **pH Level**: Bases have a pH greater than 7. They can be classified as strong or weak based on their ability to dissociate in water and produce hydroxide ions ($OH^-$).\n\n3. **Color Change in Indicators**: Bases can change the color of pH indicators. For example, they turn red litmus paper blue and can cause phenolphthalein to turn pink.\n\n4. **Electrolytic Properties**: Aqueous solutions of bases are electrolytes, meaning they can conduct electricity due to the presence of free ions.\n\n5. **Reactivity with Acids**: Bases react with acids in a neutralization reaction to form a salt and water. This reaction can be represented as:\n   $$\n   \text{Acid} + \text{Base} \rightarrow \text{Salt} + \text{Water}\n   $$\n\n6. **Hydroxide Ion Production**: Bases release hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) when dissolved in water. For example, sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$) dissociates in water to produce $Na^+$ and $OH^-$ ions.\n\n7. **Proton Acceptance**: According to the BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry theory, bases are defined as substances that can accept protons ($H^+$) from acids.\n\n8. **Less Reactivity with Metals**: Unlike acids, bases do not typically react with metals to produce hydrogen gas.\n\nThese properties make bases essential in various chemical reactions and applications, including neutralization processes, cleaning agents, and in biological systems.
