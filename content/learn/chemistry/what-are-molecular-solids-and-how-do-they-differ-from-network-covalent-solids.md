    What are molecular solids and how do they differ from network covalent solids?
answer: >-
    Molecular solids are a type of crystalline solid composed of discrete molecules held together by intermolecular forces such as van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and other weaker interactions. These solids typically exhibit lower melting points and are generally soft due to the relatively weak forces that bind the molecules together. Additionally, molecular solids are poor conductors of electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within each individual molecule.\n\nIn contrast, network covalent solids are characterized by a continuous network of covalent bonds that connect atoms throughout the material. This results in much stronger bonding compared to the intermolecular forces found in molecular solids. As a result, network covalent solids tend to have high melting points, extreme hardness, and poor electrical conductivity. Examples of network covalent solids include diamond and silicon dioxide (SiO2).\n\nTo summarize the key differences:\n\n- **Bonding**: Molecular solids are held together by intermolecular forces, while network covalent solids are held together by strong covalent bonds.\n- **Melting Points**: Molecular solids generally have lower melting points compared to the high melting points of network covalent solids.\n- **Physical Properties**: Molecular solids are typically softer and more flexible, whereas network covalent solids are hard and rigid.\n\nThese differences in bonding and properties highlight the distinct nature of molecular solids compared to network covalent solids.
