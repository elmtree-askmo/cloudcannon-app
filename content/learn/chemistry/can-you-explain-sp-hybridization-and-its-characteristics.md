answer: >-
    sp hybridization is a type of hybridization that occurs when one s orbital combines with one p orbital, resulting in the formation of two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals. This process is also referred to as diagonal hybridization. Here are the key characteristics of sp hybridization:\n\n1. **Orbital Composition**: In sp hybridization, the resulting hybrid orbitals consist of 50% s character and 50% p character. This means that each sp orbital has equal contributions from the s and p orbitals.\n\n2. **Geometry and Bond Angles**: The two sp hybrid orbitals are oriented linearly at an angle of 180 degrees with respect to each other. This linear arrangement is crucial for the molecular geometry of compounds that exhibit sp hybridization.\n\n3. **Unhybridized Orbitals**: In addition to the two sp hybrid orbitals, there are two remaining unhybridized p orbitals (p_y and p_z) that are oriented perpendicularly to the sp hybrid orbitals. These unhybridized p orbitals can participate in the formation of pi bonds.\n\n4. **Examples of sp Hybridization**: A classic example of sp hybridization can be found in acetylene (C₂H₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). In these molecules, the carbon atoms are sp hybridized, allowing for the formation of triple bonds (in acetylene) or double bonds (in carbon dioxide) with other atoms.\n\n5. **Molecular Geometry**: The linear geometry resulting from sp hybridization is essential for the stability and reactivity of certain molecules. The linear arrangement allows for optimal overlap of orbitals, leading to strong sigma bonds.\n\nIn summary, sp hybridization is characterized by the mixing of one s and one p orbital to form two sp hybrid orbitals, which are arranged linearly at 180 degrees, with significant implications for the molecular geometry and bonding properties of carbon compounds.
