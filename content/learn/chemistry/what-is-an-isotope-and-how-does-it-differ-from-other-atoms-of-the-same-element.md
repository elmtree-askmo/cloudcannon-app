    What is an isotope and how does it differ from other atoms of the same element?
answer: >-
    An isotope is a variant of a chemical element that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons in its atomic nucleus. This difference in neutron count leads to variations in atomic mass among isotopes of the same element. For example, carbon has several isotopes, including carbon-12 (with 6 protons and 6 neutrons) and carbon-14 (with 6 protons and 8 neutrons). Both isotopes are forms of carbon, but they differ in their mass due to the varying number of neutrons.\n\nThe key differences between isotopes of the same element are:\n\n1. **Number of Neutrons**: Isotopes have different numbers of neutrons. For instance, carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, while carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.\n\n2. **Atomic Mass**: Because of the differing number of neutrons, isotopes have different atomic masses. Carbon-12 has an atomic mass of approximately 12 atomic mass units (amu), while carbon-14 has an atomic mass of about 14 amu.\n\n3. **Stability**: Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive and decay over time. For example, carbon-12 is stable, whereas carbon-14 is radioactive and is used in radiocarbon dating.\n\n4. **Chemical Properties**: Isotopes of an element generally exhibit similar chemical properties because they have the same number of protons and electrons, which determine how they interact with other elements. However, slight differences in mass can lead to variations in reaction rates and physical properties.\n\nIn summary, isotopes are distinguished by their neutron count and atomic mass, while retaining the same chemical identity due to their identical proton count.
