    How is salicylic acid prepared?
answer: >-
    Salicylic acid, an organic compound with the formula C7H6O3, is primarily prepared through two main methods:\n\n1. **Kolbe-Schmitt Process**: This is the most common commercial method for producing salicylic acid. In this process, phenol is first reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium phenoxide. This intermediate then undergoes carboxylation, where carbon dioxide is introduced, leading to the formation of salicylic acid. The reaction can be summarized as follows:\n   - Phenol + Sodium Hydroxide → Sodium Phenoxide\n   - Sodium Phenoxide + CO2 → Salicylic Acid\n\n2. **Direct Carboxylation of Phenols**: Recent advancements have introduced methods that utilize transition metal-catalyzed C-H carboxylation reactions. These methods allow for the introduction of carboxyl groups into phenolic compounds using carbon dioxide, often resulting in high efficiency and selectivity. For example, a silanol-directed, palladium-catalyzed reaction has been developed, which demonstrates excellent functional-group tolerance.\n\nIn addition to these synthetic methods, salicylic acid can also be extracted from natural sources, such as the bark of the white willow and wintergreen leaves, where it occurs naturally.\n\nThese preparation methods highlight the versatility and importance of salicylic acid in various applications, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, where it serves as a precursor for the synthesis of aspirin and other therapeutic agents.
