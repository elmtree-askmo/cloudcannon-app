    To calculate equilibrium concentrations using known equilibrium constant (K) values, you can follow a systematic approach that often involves the use of ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) tables. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n### Steps to Calculate Equilibrium Concentrations\n\n1. **Write the Balanced Chemical Equation**: Start with the balanced equation for the reaction. For example, consider the reaction:\n   $$ aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD $$\n\n2. **Set Up the ICE Table**: Create an ICE table to organize the initial concentrations, the changes in concentrations, and the equilibrium concentrations. The table will look like this:\n\n   | Species | Initial Concentration | Change | Equilibrium Concentration |\n   |---------|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------|\n   | A       | [A]₀                  | -ax    | [A]₀ - ax                 |\n   | B       | [B]₀                  | -bx    | [B]₀ - bx                 |\n   | C       | 0                     | +cx    | cx                        |\n   | D       | 0                     | +dx    | dx                        |\n\n   Here, $ x $ represents the change in concentration at equilibrium based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\n3. **Express the Equilibrium Constant (K)**: Write the expression for the equilibrium constant based on the balanced equation:\n   $$\n   K = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}\n   $$\n\n4. **Substitute Equilibrium Concentrations into K Expression**: Replace the equilibrium concentrations in the K expression with those from the ICE table:\n   $$\n   K = \frac{(cx)^c(dx)^d}{([A]₀ - ax)^a([B]₀ - bx)^b}\n   $$\n\n5. **Solve for x**: Rearrange the equation to solve for $ x $. This may involve algebraic manipulation and could lead to a quadratic equation if the changes in concentrations are significant.\n\n6. **Calculate Equilibrium Concentrations**: Once you have the value of $ x $, substitute it back into the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations:\n   - For A: $ [A]_{eq} = [A]₀ - ax $\n   - For B: $ [B]_{eq} = [B]₀ - bx $\n   - For C: $ [C]_{eq} = cx $\n   - For D: $ [D]_{eq} = dx $\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nConsider the reaction:\n$$ N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g) $$\n\nAssume the equilibrium constant $ K = 0.5 $ at a certain temperature, and the initial concentrations are:\n- $ [N_2]₀ = 1.0 \, M $\n- $ [H_2]₀ = 3.0 \, M $\n- $ [NH_3]₀ = 0 \, M $\n\nSet up the ICE table:\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration | Change | Equilibrium Concentration |\n|---------|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------|\n| N₂      | 1.0                   | -x     | 1.0 - x                   |\n| H₂      | 3.0                   | -3x    | 3.0 - 3x                  |\n| NH₃     | 0                     | +2x    | 2x                        |\n\nSubstituting into the K expression:\n$$\nK = \frac{(2x)^2}{(1.0 - x)(3.0 - 3x)} = 0.5\n$$\n\nSolving this equation will yield the value of $ x $, which can then be used to find the equilibrium concentrations of all species involved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively calculate equilibrium concentrations using known K values. This method is essential for understanding the dynamics of chemical reactions and predicting the outcomes of various chemical processes.
