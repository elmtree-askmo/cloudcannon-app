    How does an increase in pressure affect chemical equilibrium?
answer: >-
    An increase in pressure affects chemical equilibrium by shifting the position of the equilibrium towards the side of the reaction that has fewer moles of gas. This behavior is explained by Le Châtelier's Principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the system will adjust to counteract that change.\n\nWhen the pressure of a gaseous reaction mixture is increased, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that decreases the total number of gas molecules. Conversely, if the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift towards the side with more gas molecules to increase the pressure. This principle is particularly relevant in reactions involving gaseous reactants and products, as changes in pressure have a measurable effect only in such systems.\n\nFor example, consider the synthesis of ammonia represented by the reaction:\n\n$$\nN_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)\n$$\n\nIn this case, there are 4 moles of gaseous reactants (1 mole of $N_2$ and 3 moles of $H_2$) and 2 moles of gaseous products ($2NH_3$). If the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of ammonia, as this results in fewer moles of gas and thus helps to reduce the pressure.\n\nIn summary, an increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium towards the side with fewer gas molecules, while a decrease in pressure will shift it towards the side with more gas molecules. This behavior is a fundamental aspect of chemical equilibrium and is crucial for understanding reaction dynamics in gaseous systems.
