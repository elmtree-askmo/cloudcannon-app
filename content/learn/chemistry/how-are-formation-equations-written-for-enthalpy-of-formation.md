    How are formation equations written for enthalpy of formation?
answer: >-
    Formation equations for enthalpy of formation are written to represent the formation of one mole of a compound from its constituent elements in their most stable states under standard conditions (typically at a temperature of 298.15 K and a pressure of 1 atm). The general format for writing these equations is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Compound**: Determine the chemical formula of the compound for which you want to write the formation equation.\n\n2. **List the Constituent Elements**: Identify the elements that make up the compound and ensure they are in their standard states. For example, carbon is typically represented as graphite, oxygen as O₂ gas, and hydrogen as H₂ gas.\n\n3. **Write the Balanced Equation**: The formation equation should show the reactants (the elements) on the left side and the product (the compound) on the right side. The equation must be balanced to reflect the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFor example, the formation equation for carbon dioxide (CO₂) is written as:\n\n$$\nC(graphite) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)\n$$\n\nThis equation indicates that one mole of carbon dioxide is formed from one mole of carbon in its graphite form and one mole of oxygen gas.\n\nAnother example is the formation of hexane (C₆H₁₄):\n\n$$\n6C(graphite) + 7H_2(g) \rightarrow C_6H_{14}(l)\n$$\n\nIn this case, six moles of carbon and seven moles of hydrogen gas combine to form one mole of liquid hexane.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation, denoted as ΔH_f°, is the enthalpy change associated with this reaction and is typically provided in tables for various compounds. It is important to note that the enthalpy of formation is defined for the formation of one mole of the compound, and thus the coefficients in the balanced equation must reflect this requirement.
