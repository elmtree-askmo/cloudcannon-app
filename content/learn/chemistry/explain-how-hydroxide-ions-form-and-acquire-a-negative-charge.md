    Explain how hydroxide ions form and acquire a negative charge.
answer: >-
    Hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) form through the process of auto-ionization of water, which can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction:\n\n$$\n\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n$$\n\nIn this reaction, a water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) donates a hydrogen ion ($\text{H}^+$), resulting in the formation of a hydroxide ion ($\text{OH}^-$). The hydroxide ion acquires a negative charge because it has one more electron than protons. Specifically, the hydroxide ion consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to one hydrogen atom, and it carries an extra electron, giving it a net charge of -1.\n\nThe presence of hydroxide ions is crucial in determining the basicity of a solution. In basic solutions, the concentration of hydroxide ions is greater than that of hydronium ions ($\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$), which leads to a higher pH value (greater than 7). Conversely, in acidic solutions, the concentration of hydronium ions exceeds that of hydroxide ions.\n\nAdditionally, hydroxide ions can also be produced through the dissociation of bases in aqueous solutions. For example, when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it dissociates to release hydroxide ions:\n\n$$\n\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n$$\n\nThis further illustrates how hydroxide ions can acquire a negative charge through the loss of a hydrogen ion from water or through the dissociation of a base. \n\nIn summary, hydroxide ions form when water molecules lose hydrogen ions, resulting in a negatively charged ion that plays a significant role in acid-base chemistry and the pH of solutions.
