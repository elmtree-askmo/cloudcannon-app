    What are the common methods for determining the composition of a chemical compound?
answer: >-
    Determining the composition of a chemical compound can be achieved through various analytical methods. Here are some common techniques used in chemical analysis:\n\n1. **Elemental Analysis (EA)**: This technique is employed to determine the elemental composition of chemical compounds. It identifies which elements are present and in what proportions. Elemental analysis is crucial for understanding the fundamental makeup of a compound.\n\n2. **Combustion Analysis**: This gravimetric method involves burning a sample and measuring the gaseous products produced. By analyzing the amounts of carbon dioxide and water generated, one can deduce the elemental composition of the original compound.\n\n3. **Mass Spectrometry**: This powerful analytical technique measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It is widely used to identify unknown compounds, determine the composition of complex mixtures, and study molecular structures.\n\n4. **Titration**: This method involves adding a titrant to a solution until a reaction reaches its endpoint. For example, titrating a sample of acid rain with sodium hydroxide can help determine the concentration of acidic components in the sample.\n\n5. **Infrared Spectroscopy**: This technique is used to identify functional groups within organic compounds by measuring the absorption of infrared light, which causes molecular vibrations.\n\n6. **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**: NMR is used to determine the structure of organic compounds by observing the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei.\n\n7. **Chromatography**: This method separates components of a mixture based on their different interactions with a stationary phase and a mobile phase. It is useful for analyzing complex mixtures and determining the composition of individual components.\n\n8. **Gravimetric Analysis**: This involves measuring the mass of a substance to determine its composition. It often includes precipitating a compound and weighing the resulting solid.\n\nThese methods can be used individually or in combination to provide a comprehensive understanding of a compound's composition, including its empirical and molecular formulas. Each technique has its strengths and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the analysis.
