answer: >-
    To write the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of a salt in a solubility equilibrium, we first need to understand the dissociation reaction of the salt in question. The general form of the dissociation reaction for a salt $ AB $ that dissociates into its ions $ A^+ $ and $ B^- $ can be represented as:\n\n$$\nAB_{(s)} \rightleftharpoons A^+_{(aq)} + B^-_{(aq)}\n$$\n\nIn this reaction, $ AB $ is the solid salt, and $ A^+ $ and $ B^- $ are the ions in aqueous solution.\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the solubility product constant $ K_{sp} $ is derived from the concentrations of the ions at equilibrium. For the dissociation of the salt $ AB $, the $ K_{sp} $ expression is given by:\n\n$$\nK_{sp} = [A^+][B^-]\n$$\n\nFor a more complex salt $ A_mB_n $ that dissociates into $ m $ moles of $ A^+ $ and $ n $ moles of $ B^- $, the dissociation reaction can be written as:\n\n$$\nA_mB_n_{(s)} \rightleftharpoons mA^+_{(aq)} + nB^-_{(aq)}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding $ K_{sp} $ expression for this reaction would be:\n\n$$\nK_{sp} = [A^+]^m [B^-]^n\n$$\n\nThis expression allows us to quantify the solubility of the salt in a saturated solution, where the concentrations of the ions remain constant at equilibrium. \n\nTo calculate the molar solubility of a salt, one can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table based on the dissociation reaction and solve for the concentrations of the ions at equilibrium using the known $ K_{sp} $ value. \n\nFor example, for silver chloride ($ AgCl $), the dissociation reaction is:\n\n$$\nAgCl_{(s)} \rightleftharpoons Ag^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}\n$$\n\nThe $ K_{sp} $ expression is:\n\n$$\nK_{sp} = [Ag^+][Cl^-]\n$$\n\nIf $ s $ is the molar solubility of $ AgCl $, then at equilibrium:\n\n$$\nK_{sp} = s \cdot s = s^2\n$$\n\nThis allows for the calculation of $ s $ using the given $ K_{sp} $ value for silver chloride.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of a salt in a solubility equilibrium is based on the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction and is represented by the solubility product constant $ K_{sp} $.
