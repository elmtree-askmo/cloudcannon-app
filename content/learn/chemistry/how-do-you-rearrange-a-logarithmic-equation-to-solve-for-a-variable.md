    How do you rearrange a logarithmic equation to solve for a variable?
answer: >-
    To rearrange a logarithmic equation to solve for a variable, you can follow a systematic approach that involves converting the logarithmic form to its equivalent exponential form. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using the general form of a logarithmic equation:\n\n1. **Identify the Logarithmic Equation**: Start with the equation in the form:\n   $$\n   \log_b(x) = y\n   $$\n   where $ b $ is the base of the logarithm, $ x $ is the argument, and $ y $ is the result.\n\n2. **Convert to Exponential Form**: Use the definition of logarithms to convert the equation to its exponential form:\n   $$\n   x = b^y\n   $$\n   This step isolates the variable $ x $.\n\n3. **Rearranging for Other Variables**: If you need to solve for a different variable, you can manipulate the equation accordingly. For example, if you have:\n   $$\n   \log_b(x) = y \implies x = b^y\n   $$\n   and you want to solve for $ y $, you can take the logarithm of both sides:\n   $$\n   y = \log_b(x)\n   $$\n\n### Example in pH Calculations\n\nIn the context of pH calculations, we often rearrange the pH equation to find the concentration of hydrogen ions $[H^+]$ from the pH value. The pH is defined as:\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}([H^+])\n$$\n\nTo solve for $[H^+]$:\n\n1. **Multiply by -1**:\n   $$\n   -\text{pH} = \log_{10}([H^+])\n   $$\n\n2. **Convert to Exponential Form**:\n   $$\n   [H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n   $$\n\nThis rearrangement allows you to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration directly from the pH value.\n\n### Summary of Key Steps\n- Identify the logarithmic equation.\n- Convert to exponential form to isolate the variable.\n- If necessary, take logarithms of both sides to solve for other variables.\n\nUnderstanding these steps is crucial for effectively manipulating logarithmic equations in various mathematical and scientific contexts.
