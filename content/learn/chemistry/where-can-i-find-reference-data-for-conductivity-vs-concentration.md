answer: >-
    For reference data on conductivity versus concentration, you can explore several sources that provide detailed charts and tables for various common solutions. Here are some notable references:\n\n1. **Emerson's Conductance Data**: This source includes conductivity versus concentration charts for many commonly used chemicals, specifically at a reference temperature of 25°C (77°F). It provides a comprehensive overview of the conductivity of various solutions.\n\n2. **Technical Reference by Omega Engineering**: This document offers technical insights into conductivity, including specific data points for different concentrations of solutions like NaOH, HNO₃, and H₂SO₄.\n\n3. **Petr Vanysek's Tables**: This reference provides equivalent (molar) conductivity values at 25°C for several common electrolytes in aqueous solutions, covering concentrations up to 0.1 mol/L.\n\n4. **Conductivity Tables for Aqueous Solutions**: There are tables available that list the electrical conductivity of aqueous solutions of acids, bases, and salts as a function of concentration, typically at 20°C. These tables can be particularly useful for understanding how conductivity changes with concentration.\n\n5. **Scientific Journals**: Research articles often include plots and data on conductivity versus concentration for specific electrolytes, such as KCl and CH₃COOH, which can be found in journals related to chemical engineering and physical chemistry.\n\nThese resources should provide a solid foundation for obtaining reference data on conductivity as it relates to concentration.
