    A decomposition reaction is a chemical reaction where a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances, requiring energy input and can be classified into various types like thermal decomposition, photolytic decomposition, and electrolysis.

    What is the definition of a decomposition reaction?
answer: >-
    A decomposition reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. This process is essentially the opposite of a synthesis reaction, where simpler substances combine to form a more complex compound. The general form of a decomposition reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\ce{AB} \rightarrow \ce{A} + \ce{B}\n$$\n\nIn most cases, decomposition reactions require an input of energy to proceed, which can come in the form of heat, light, or electricity. This energy is necessary to break the bonds within the compound, allowing it to separate into its constituent parts.\n\nFor example, when carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) decomposes, it breaks down into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O):\n\n$$\n\ce{H2CO3 (aq) -> CO2 (g) + H2O (l)}\n$$\n\nDecomposition reactions can be classified into several types, including thermal decomposition (where heat is applied), photolytic decomposition (where light energy is used), and electrolysis (where an electric current is applied). Each of these types involves different mechanisms and conditions for the breakdown of the reactant.
