    What is the role of the anode and cathode in a galvanic cell?
answer: >-
    In a galvanic cell, the roles of the anode and cathode are crucial for the functioning of the cell, which converts chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions.\n\n1. **Anode**: The anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs. During this process, a substance loses electrons. In a galvanic cell, the anode is typically the negative terminal because it is the source of electrons that flow through the external circuit to the cathode. For example, in a Daniell cell, zinc (Zn) is oxidized at the anode, where it loses electrons to form zinc ions (Zn²⁺).\n\n2. **Cathode**: The cathode is the electrode where reduction takes place. Here, a substance gains electrons. In a galvanic cell, the cathode is usually the positive terminal because it receives electrons from the anode. Continuing with the Daniell cell example, copper ions (Cu²⁺) are reduced at the cathode, where they gain electrons to form solid copper (Cu).\n\nThe overall cell potential (E_cell) for a galvanic cell can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nE_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}\n$$\n\nThis equation indicates that the cell potential is determined by the difference in standard reduction potentials of the two half-reactions occurring at the cathode and anode.\n\nIn summary, the anode is where oxidation occurs and electrons are released, while the cathode is where reduction occurs and electrons are accepted. This flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit is what generates electrical energy in a galvanic cell.
