    What is a key property of transition metals that distinguishes them from main group elements?
answer: >-
    A key property that distinguishes transition metals from main group elements is their ability to form multiple oxidation states. Transition metals, which are found in groups 3-12 of the periodic table, can lose different numbers of electrons, allowing them to exist in various ionic forms. For example, iron (Fe) can have oxidation states of +2 (ferrous) and +3 (ferric), among others. This versatility in oxidation states enables transition metals to participate in a wide range of chemical reactions and form complex ions.\n\nIn contrast, main group elements, which are located in groups 1, 2, and 13-18, typically exhibit more predictable and limited oxidation states based on their valence electron configurations. For instance, sodium (Na), a main group element, predominantly forms a +1 ion, while magnesium (Mg) typically forms a +2 ion. This difference in oxidation state flexibility contributes to the diverse chemistry and applications of transition metals, including their use in catalysts and pigments, as well as their characteristic colorful compounds.
