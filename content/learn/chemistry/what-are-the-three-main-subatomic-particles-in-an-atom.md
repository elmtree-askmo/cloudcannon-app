    What are the three main subatomic particles in an atom?
answer: >-
    The three main subatomic particles in an atom are:\n\n1. **Protons**: These are positively charged particles located in the nucleus of the atom. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number of the element and its identity.\n\n2. **Neutrons**: These are neutral particles, meaning they have no charge, and are also found in the nucleus alongside protons. Neutrons contribute to the atomic mass of the atom but do not affect its charge.\n\n3. **Electrons**: These are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in electron shells. Electrons play a crucial role in chemical bonding and the behavior of atoms in reactions.\n\nTogether, these subatomic particles define the structure and properties of atoms, which are the fundamental building blocks of matter.
