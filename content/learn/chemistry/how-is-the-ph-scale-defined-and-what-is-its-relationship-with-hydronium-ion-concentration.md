    The pH scale quantifies acidity or basicity based on hydronium ion concentration, defined by the equation pH = -log[HO]. It ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidity and above 7 indicating basicity.

    How is the pH scale defined, and what is its relationship with hydronium ion concentration?
answer: >-
    The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to quantify the acidity or basicity of a solution. It is defined by the equation:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log[H_3O^+]\n$$\n\nwhere $[H_3O^+]$ represents the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) in moles per liter (M). The scale typically ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being considered neutral. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, indicating a higher concentration of hydronium ions, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic, indicating a lower concentration of hydronium ions.\n\nThe relationship between pH and hydronium ion concentration is inversely logarithmic. For example, a solution with a hydronium ion concentration of $1.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}$ has a pH of 5. Conversely, the hydronium ion concentration can be calculated from the pH using the formula:\n\n$$\n[H_3O^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n$$\n\nThis means that as the pH decreases (indicating increased acidity), the concentration of hydronium ions increases exponentially. For instance, a solution with a pH of 3 has a hydronium ion concentration of $1.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}$.\n\nIn summary, the pH scale provides a convenient way to express the acidity or basicity of a solution, and it is directly related to the concentration of hydronium ions through a logarithmic relationship.
