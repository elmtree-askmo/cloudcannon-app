    What type of bond is formed between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule?
answer: >-
    The bond formed between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule (Hâ‚‚O) is a covalent bond. Specifically, each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the oxygen atom, resulting in two single covalent bonds. This sharing of electrons allows the atoms to achieve a more stable electron configuration, which is essential for the stability of the water molecule.\n\nCovalent bonds are characterized by their strength and stability, making them fundamental to the formation of stable molecules like water. In summary, the type of bond between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is a single covalent bond.
