    Compare the hydrogen ion concentration and pH values of pure water to other solutions.
answer: >-
    To compare the hydrogen ion concentration and pH values of pure water with other solutions, we can look at the following key points:\n\n### Hydrogen Ion Concentration\n- **Pure Water**: At 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) in pure water is approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar. This reflects the auto-ionization of water, where water molecules dissociate into hydronium and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n- **Orange Juice**: The hydrogen ion concentration in orange juice is significantly higher, around $1 \times 10^{-4}$ molar, indicating that it is more acidic than pure water.\n- **Bleach**: In contrast, bleach has a much lower hydrogen ion concentration, approximately $1 \times 10^{-12}$ molar, making it more basic than pure water.\n\n### pH Values\nThe pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution, defined as:\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]\n$$\n- **Pure Water**: The pH of pure water is 7, which is considered neutral.\n- **Orange Juice**: With a hydrogen ion concentration of $1 \times 10^{-4}$ molar, the pH of orange juice is calculated as:\n  $$\n  \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-4}) = 4\n  $$\n  This indicates that orange juice is acidic.\n- **Bleach**: For bleach, with a hydrogen ion concentration of $1 \times 10^{-12}$ molar, the pH is:\n  $$\n  \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1 \times 10^{-12}) = 12\n  $$\n  This shows that bleach is basic.\n\n### Summary of Comparison\n- **Pure Water**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M\n  - pH: 7 (neutral)\n  \n- **Orange Juice**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-4}$ M\n  - pH: 4 (acidic)\n  \n- **Bleach**: \n  - Hydrogen Ion Concentration: $1 \times 10^{-12}$ M\n  - pH: 12 (basic)\n\nThis comparison illustrates the significant differences in acidity and basicity among these solutions, with pure water serving as a neutral reference point.
