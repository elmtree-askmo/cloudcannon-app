    What is the difference between a cation and an anion?
answer: >-
    The difference between a cation and an anion lies in their charges and the processes by which they are formed:\n\n1. **Cation**: A cation is a positively charged ion that is formed when an atom or molecule loses one or more electrons. This loss of electrons results in a greater number of protons than electrons, leading to a net positive charge. Cations are typically formed by metals. For example, sodium (Na) can lose one electron to form the sodium cation (Na⁺), achieving a stable electron configuration similar to that of the noble gas neon.\n\n2. **Anion**: An anion is a negatively charged ion that is formed when an atom or molecule gains one or more electrons. This gain of electrons results in a greater number of electrons than protons, leading to a net negative charge. Anions are typically formed by nonmetals. For example, chlorine (Cl) can gain one electron to form the chloride anion (Cl⁻), achieving an electron configuration similar to that of the noble gas argon.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that cations are positively charged due to the loss of electrons, while anions are negatively charged due to the gain of electrons.
