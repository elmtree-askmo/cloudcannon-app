    What is stoichiometry and why is it important in chemical reactions?
answer: >-
    Stoichiometry is a fundamental branch of chemistry that focuses on the quantitative relationships between the reactants and products in chemical reactions. It enables chemists to predict the amounts of substances that are consumed and produced during a reaction by using balanced chemical equations. For instance, in the reaction:\n\n$$\n2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O\n$$\n\nstoichiometry indicates that 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to yield 2 moles of water. This relationship is crucial for various applications in chemistry.\n\n### Importance of Stoichiometry\n\n1. **Predicting Reaction Outcomes**: Stoichiometry allows chemists to calculate the expected amounts of products formed from given quantities of reactants. This is essential for planning experiments and industrial processes.\n\n2. **Conservation of Mass**: Stoichiometry is grounded in the principle of conservation of mass, which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This principle ensures that the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products, which is vital for balancing chemical equations.\n\n3. **Molar Mass Calculations**: Molar mass plays a significant role in stoichiometric calculations. It allows for the conversion between grams and moles, facilitating the determination of how much of a reactant is needed or how much product will be formed. For example, knowing the molar mass of water (H₂O), which is approximately 18.02 g/mol, helps in calculating the mass of water produced in a reaction.\n\n4. **Yield Calculations**: Stoichiometry is used to calculate the theoretical yield of a reaction, which is the maximum amount of product that can be formed from the given amounts of reactants. This is important for assessing the efficiency of chemical reactions.\n\n5. **Solution Preparation**: In preparing solutions, stoichiometry is essential for determining the amount of solute required to achieve a desired concentration, which is critical in laboratory settings and industrial applications.\n\nIn summary, stoichiometry is vital for understanding and predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions, ensuring the conservation of mass, and facilitating various calculations related to chemical processes.
