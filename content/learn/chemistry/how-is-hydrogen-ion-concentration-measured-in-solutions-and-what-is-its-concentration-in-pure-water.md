    How is hydrogen ion concentration measured in solutions, and what is its concentration in pure water?
answer: >-
    Hydrogen ion concentration in solutions is measured in terms of molarity, which is expressed in moles of solute per liter of solution (mol/L or M). This unit provides a quantitative measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions ($[H^+]$) in a given solution.\n\nTo calculate the hydrogen ion concentration from the pH value, the following relationship is used:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n$$\n\nFrom this equation, you can rearrange it to find the hydrogen ion concentration:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n$$\n\nFor example, if the pH of a solution is 4, the hydrogen ion concentration can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 10^{-4} \text{ mol/L} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ M}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the solution is acidic, as it has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions compared to pure water.\n\nIn pure water at 25 degrees Celsius, the concentration of hydrogen ions is approximately:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 1 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}\n$$\n\nThis concentration reflects the auto-ionization of water, where water molecules dissociate into hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻). The pH of pure water is therefore 7, which is considered neutral.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Measurement**: Hydrogen ion concentration is measured in molarity (mol/L).\n- **Pure Water Concentration**: Approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M at 25°C.\n- **pH of Pure Water**: 7, indicating a neutral solution.\n\nThis understanding of hydrogen ion concentration is crucial for comparing acidic and basic solutions, as well as for various applications in chemistry and biology.
