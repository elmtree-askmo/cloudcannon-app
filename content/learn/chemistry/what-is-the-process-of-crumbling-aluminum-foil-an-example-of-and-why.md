    What is the process of crumbling aluminum foil an example of, and why?
answer: >-
    Crumbling aluminum foil is an example of a **physical change**. This is because the process of crumpling does not alter the chemical composition of the aluminum; it simply changes its shape. The aluminum foil remains aluminum foil regardless of how it is crumpled or flattened. \n\nIn a physical change, the substance involved retains its identity and properties, even though its form may change. For instance, when you crumple the foil, it can be flattened back out again without any chemical transformation occurring. This is in contrast to a chemical change, where the substance would undergo a transformation that alters its chemical structure, resulting in a different substance altogether.\n\nThus, crumbling aluminum foil is a clear demonstration of a physical change, as it involves a change in shape without any change in the material's chemical identity.
