    Can you provide examples of common molecules that contain each of the functional groups?
answer: >-
    Functional groups are specific groupings of atoms within molecules that impart characteristic properties and reactivity to those molecules. Here are some common functional groups along with examples of molecules that contain them:\n\n1. **Alcohols**: Characterized by the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n   - Example: Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)\n\n2. **Amines**: Contain a nitrogen atom bonded to carbon atoms.\n   - Example: Methylamine (CH₃NH₂)\n\n3. **Carboxylic Acids**: Contain a carboxyl group (-COOH).\n   - Example: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n\n4. **Aldehydes**: Feature a carbonyl group (C=O) at the end of a carbon chain.\n   - Example: Formaldehyde (HCHO)\n\n5. **Ketones**: Have a carbonyl group (C=O) within the carbon chain.\n   - Example: Acetone (C₃H₆O)\n\n6. **Esters**: Formed from the reaction of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, characterized by the -CO₂- group.\n   - Example: Ethyl acetate (C₄H₈O₂)\n\n7. **Ethers**: Contain an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups.\n   - Example: Diethyl ether (C₄H₁₀O)\n\n8. **Alkenes**: Characterized by at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n   - Example: Ethylene (C₂H₄)\n\n9. **Alkynes**: Contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond (C≡C).\n   - Example: Acetylene (C₂H₂)\n\n10. **Phenols**: Contain a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aromatic hydrocarbon.\n    - Example: Phenol (C₆H₅OH)\n\nThese functional groups are fundamental in organic chemistry and biochemistry, influencing the physical and chemical properties of the molecules they are part of. Understanding these groups is essential for predicting the behavior of organic compounds and designing new chemical reactions and pharmaceuticals.
