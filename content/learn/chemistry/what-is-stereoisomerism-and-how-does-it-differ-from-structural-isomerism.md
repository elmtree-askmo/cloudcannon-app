    What is stereoisomerism and how does it differ from structural isomerism?
answer: >-
    Stereoisomerism is a type of isomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. This spatial arrangement leads to different chemical and physical properties among the isomers. Stereoisomers can be further classified into two main categories: enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other, similar to how one's left and right hands are mirror images, while diastereomers are not mirror images and can have different physical properties.\n\nIn contrast, structural isomerism, also known as constitutional isomerism, occurs when molecules have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity or order of the atoms. This means that the atoms are arranged in a different order, leading to distinct structural arrangements and often resulting in different chemical and physical properties. Examples of structural isomerism include chain isomerism, functional group isomerism, and tautomeric isomerism.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between stereoisomerism and structural isomerism lies in the nature of the differences: stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement, while structural isomers differ in the connectivity of their atoms.
