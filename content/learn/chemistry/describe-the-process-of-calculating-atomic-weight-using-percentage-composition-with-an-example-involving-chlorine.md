    To calculate the atomic weight of an element using percentage composition, you need to consider the masses of its isotopes and their relative abundances. The atomic weight is essentially the weighted average of the atomic masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of that element.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Atomic Weight\n\n1. **Identify the Isotopes**: Determine the isotopes of the element and their respective atomic masses.\n2. **Determine Abundance**: Find the percentage abundance of each isotope in nature.\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Use the formula for calculating atomic weight, which is:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{(\text{mass of isotope 1} \times \text{abundance of isotope 1}) + (\text{mass of isotope 2} \times \text{abundance of isotope 2})}{100}\n   $$\n\n### Example: Chlorine\n\nChlorine has two stable isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. The atomic masses and their natural abundances are as follows:\n\n- **Chlorine-35**: Atomic mass = 35 AMU, Abundance = 75%\n- **Chlorine-37**: Atomic mass = 37 AMU, Abundance = 25%\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n1. Calculate the contribution of each isotope to the atomic weight:\n   - Contribution from chlorine-35:\n     $$ \n     35 \, \text{AMU} \times 75 = 2625 \n     $$\n   - Contribution from chlorine-37:\n     $$ \n     37 \, \text{AMU} \times 25 = 925 \n     $$\n\n2. Add these contributions together:\n   $$\n   2625 + 925 = 3550 \n   $$\n\n3. Divide by 100 to find the atomic weight:\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{3550}{100} = 35.5 \, \text{AMU}\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the atomic weight of chlorine, calculated using the percentage composition of its isotopes, is approximately 35.5 AMU. This value reflects the weighted average based on the natural abundance of chlorine-35 and chlorine-37, demonstrating how the atomic weight is influenced more by the more abundant isotope. Understanding this process is crucial for mastering concepts in chemistry, especially for exams like the MCAT.
