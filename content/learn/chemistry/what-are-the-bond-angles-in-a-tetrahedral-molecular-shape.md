    What are the bond angles in a tetrahedral molecular shape?
answer: >-
    In a tetrahedral molecular shape, the standard bond angle is approximately 109.5°. This angle is observed when a central atom is bonded to four substituents that are symmetrically arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, as seen in molecules like methane (CH₄). The tetrahedral geometry arises from the sp³ hybridization of the central atom's orbitals, which allows for optimal spatial arrangement to minimize electron pair repulsion.\n\nHowever, the presence of lone pairs can affect these bond angles. For instance, if one of the four bonding pairs is replaced by a lone pair, the bond angle decreases to about 107° due to the increased repulsion exerted by the lone pair. If there are two lone pairs, the bond angle further decreases to approximately 104.5° as the lone pairs push the bonding pairs closer together.\n\nIn summary, the ideal bond angle in a tetrahedral molecular geometry is 109.5°, but this can be reduced to 107° or 104.5° depending on the number of lone pairs present.
