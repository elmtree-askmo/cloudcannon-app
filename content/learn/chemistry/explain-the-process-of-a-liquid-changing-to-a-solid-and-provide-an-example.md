    Explain the process of a liquid changing to a solid and provide an example.
answer: >-
    The process of a liquid changing to a solid is known as freezing or solidification. This transition occurs when the temperature of the liquid is lowered to its freezing point, at which point the molecules lose energy and begin to arrange themselves into a more ordered structure, forming a solid.\n\nFor example, when water is cooled to 0째C (32째F), it undergoes freezing and transforms into ice. At this temperature, the kinetic energy of the water molecules decreases, allowing them to bond together in a crystalline structure characteristic of ice. This process can be observed when ice cubes are made in a freezer; the water inside the ice tray loses heat to the surrounding environment, eventually reaching the freezing point and solidifying.\n\nIt's important to note that the freezing point is the same as the melting point of the solid. Thus, at 0째C, water can exist in both liquid and solid states in equilibrium. Additionally, under certain conditions, a liquid can be cooled below its freezing point without solidifying, a phenomenon known as supercooling. This occurs when there are insufficient nucleation sites for the formation of ice crystals.\n\nIn summary, the transition from liquid to solid is a physical change that is primarily influenced by temperature, and water freezing into ice is a common example of this process.
