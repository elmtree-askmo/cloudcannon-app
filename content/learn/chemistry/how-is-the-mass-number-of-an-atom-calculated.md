    How is the mass number of an atom calculated?
answer: >-
    The mass number of an atom is calculated by summing the total number of protons and neutrons present in its nucleus. This can be expressed with the formula:\n\n$$\nA = Z + N\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ A $ is the mass number,\n- $ Z $ is the atomic number (the number of protons), and\n- $ N $ is the number of neutrons.\n\nTo illustrate, if an atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, the mass number would be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nA = 8 \text{ (protons)} + 8 \text{ (neutrons)} = 16\n$$\n\nThus, the mass number of Oxygen-16 is 16. The mass number is an integer value and provides an approximate idea of the mass of an atom, as it reflects the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Understanding the mass number is crucial for predicting an element's physical and chemical properties, as well as its behavior in various atomic reactions.
