    Chlorine molecules exhibit London dispersion forces, arising from fluctuations in electron density that create temporary dipoles and induce attraction between nonpolar Cl2 molecules. This helps explain their physical properties such as boiling point.

    How do chlorine molecules exhibit London dispersion forces?
answer: >-
    Chlorine molecules (Cl₂) exhibit London dispersion forces, which are a type of intermolecular force that arises due to the temporary fluctuations in electron density within molecules. These fluctuations create instantaneous dipoles that can induce dipoles in neighboring molecules, leading to an attractive force between them.\n\nIn the case of chlorine, which is a diatomic nonpolar molecule, the London dispersion forces are the only type of intermolecular force present. Although chlorine molecules are covalently bonded (Cl-Cl), the interactions between separate Cl₂ molecules are governed by these dispersion forces. The strength of London dispersion forces is influenced by the size and polarizability of the molecules involved. Chlorine, with a molar mass of approximately 71 g/mol and a relatively larger atomic radius compared to lighter gases like fluorine, exhibits stronger London dispersion forces than smaller, lighter molecules.\n\nAs the chlorine molecules come close to each other, the movement of electrons can lead to temporary dipoles, which in turn induce dipoles in adjacent molecules. This results in an attractive force that contributes to the overall behavior of chlorine gas, including its physical properties such as boiling point. For instance, chlorine has a boiling point of 238 K, which is higher than that of fluorine (F₂) due to the stronger London dispersion forces present in Cl₂.\n\nIn summary, chlorine molecules exhibit London dispersion forces due to the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, which create attractive interactions between nonpolar Cl₂ molecules. These forces are significant in determining the physical properties of chlorine, particularly in the context of its state at room temperature and its boiling point.
