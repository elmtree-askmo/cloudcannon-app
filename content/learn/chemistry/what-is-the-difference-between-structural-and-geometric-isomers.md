    What is the difference between structural and geometric isomers?
answer: >-
    Structural and geometric isomers are two distinct types of isomerism in organic chemistry, each characterized by different arrangements of atoms within molecules.\n\n### Structural Isomers\nStructural isomers, also known as constitutional isomers, are compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity of their atoms. This means that the atoms are arranged in different ways, leading to different structural formulas. For example, consider the compounds 1-butene and 2-butene, both of which have the molecular formula C₄H₈. In 1-butene, the double bond is located between the first and second carbon atoms, while in 2-butene, the double bond is between the second and third carbon atoms. This difference in the arrangement of atoms results in distinct structural properties and reactivities.\n\n### Geometric Isomers\nGeometric isomers, also known as cis-trans isomers, are a type of stereoisomer where the arrangement of atoms differs around a double bond or a ring structure. In geometric isomerism, the connectivity of atoms remains the same, but the spatial arrangement of groups attached to the double bond or ring varies. For instance, in 2-butene, the cis isomer has the two methyl groups on the same side of the double bond, while the trans isomer has them on opposite sides. This difference in orientation can lead to significant variations in physical properties, such as boiling points and solubility.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Structural Isomers**: Same molecular formula, different connectivity of atoms (e.g., 1-butene vs. 2-butene).\n- **Geometric Isomers**: Same molecular formula and connectivity, different spatial arrangements around a double bond or ring (e.g., cis-2-butene vs. trans-2-butene).\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial in organic chemistry, as they can significantly influence the chemical behavior and properties of the compounds involved.
