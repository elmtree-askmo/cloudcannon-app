answer: >-
    Here are some examples of molarity calculations based on the gathered information:\n\n### Example 1: Hydrochloric Acid Solution\nA solution is prepared by dissolving 1.56 grams of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water, and the total volume of the solution is 26.8 mL. To calculate the molarity:\n\n1. **Convert grams to moles**:\n   - Molar mass of HCl = 36.46 g/mol\n   - Moles of HCl = $\frac{1.56 \text{ g}}{36.46 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.0428 \text{ mol}$\n\n2. **Convert volume from mL to L**:\n   - Volume in liters = $\frac{26.8 \text{ mL}}{1000} = 0.0268 \text{ L}$\n\n3. **Calculate molarity (M)**:\n   - Molarity = $\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}} = \frac{0.0428 \text{ mol}}{0.0268 \text{ L}} \approx 1.60 \text{ M}$\n\n### Example 2: Gold (III) Chloride Solution\nCalculate the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 1.64 moles of gold (III) chloride (AuCl₃) in 795 mL of water.\n\n1. **Convert volume from mL to L**:\n   - Volume in liters = $\frac{795 \text{ mL}}{1000} = 0.795 \text{ L}$\n\n2. **Calculate molarity (M)**:\n   - Molarity = $\frac{1.64 \text{ mol}}{0.795 \text{ L}} \approx 2.06 \text{ M}$\n\n### Example 3: Calcium Chloride Solution\nA solution is prepared by dissolving 10 grams of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) in 200 mL of water.\n\n1. **Convert grams to moles**:\n   - Molar mass of CaCl₂ = 110.98 g/mol\n   - Moles of CaCl₂ = $\frac{10 \text{ g}}{110.98 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.0902 \text{ mol}$\n\n2. **Convert volume from mL to L**:\n   - Volume in liters = $\frac{200 \text{ mL}}{1000} = 0.200 \text{ L}$\n\n3. **Calculate molarity (M)**:\n   - Molarity = $\frac{0.0902 \text{ mol}}{0.200 \text{ L}} \approx 0.451 \text{ M}$\n\n### Example 4: Ammonia Solution\nCalculate the molarity of a solution containing 4.25 grams of ammonia (NH₃) in 0.500 L of solution.\n\n1. **Convert grams to moles**:\n   - Molar mass of NH₃ = 17.03 g/mol\n   - Moles of NH₃ = $\frac{4.25 \text{ g}}{17.03 \text{ g/mol}} \approx 0.249 \text{ mol}$\n\n2. **Calculate molarity (M)**:\n   - Molarity = $\frac{0.249 \text{ mol}}{0.500 \text{ L}} \approx 0.498 \text{ M}$\n\nThese examples illustrate how to calculate molarity using the number of moles of solute and the volume of the solution in liters.
