    The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, defining the element's identity and position in the periodic table. It also indicates the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

    What is the atomic number and how is it determined for an element?
answer: >-
    The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. This number is crucial because it uniquely identifies the element and determines its position in the periodic table. Each element has a distinct atomic number, which is always a whole number. For example, sodium (Na) has an atomic number of 11, indicating that it contains 11 protons in its nucleus.\n\nThe atomic number also has implications for the number of electrons in a neutral atom. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, ensuring that the atom has no overall charge. Therefore, for sodium, with an atomic number of 11, there are also 11 electrons orbiting the nucleus.\n\nIn summary, the atomic number is a fundamental property of an element that not only defines its identity but also influences its chemical behavior and interactions. It is typically found at the top of the element's square in the periodic table. For instance, chlorine (Cl) has an atomic number of 17, indicating it has 17 protons.
