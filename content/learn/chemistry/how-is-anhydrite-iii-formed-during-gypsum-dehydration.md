    How is Anhydrite III formed during gypsum dehydration?
answer: >-
    Anhydrite III is formed during the dehydration of gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) through a multi-step process. Initially, gypsum undergoes dehydration to form bassanite (CaSO₄·0.5H₂O) at temperatures around 85°C. As the temperature increases, typically above 400°C, the structure of bassanite can further transform into anhydrite III, which is a dehydrated form of calcium sulfate.\n\nThe dehydration process is reversible, meaning that when water is reintroduced, the empty channels in the anhydrite III structure can be refilled with water molecules, potentially forming bassanite again without dissolution. This reversible nature is significant in various applications, particularly in the cement industry, where the hydration kinetics of these phases are crucial for achieving optimal cement performance.\n\nThe formation of anhydrite III is not always straightforward to observe in thermal analysis, as it may not present a distinct peak. Instead, changes in the crystal structure can be detected at higher temperatures, with the transition to anhydrite II occurring around 400°C and further sintering of the crystals at approximately 700°C. The entire dehydration process can be influenced by various factors, including the purity of the gypsum and the specific conditions under which dehydration occurs. \n\nIn summary, anhydrite III is formed from gypsum through a stepwise dehydration process, with the initial formation of bassanite followed by further dehydration at elevated temperatures.
