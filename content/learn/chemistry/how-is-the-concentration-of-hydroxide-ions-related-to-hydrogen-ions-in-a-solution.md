    How is the concentration of hydroxide ions related to hydrogen ions in a solution?
answer: >-
    The concentration of hydroxide ions ($[\text{OH}^-]$) in a solution is inversely related to the concentration of hydrogen ions ($[\text{H}^+]$) through the water dissociation constant, which is defined as:\n\n$$\nK_w = [\text{H}^+][\text{OH}^-] = 1 \times 10^{-14} \text{ at 25°C}\n$$\n\nThis means that as the concentration of hydrogen ions increases, the concentration of hydroxide ions decreases, and vice versa. For example, if the concentration of hydrogen ions is known, the concentration of hydroxide ions can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{K_w}{[\text{H}^+]}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if the concentration of hydrogen ions is $1 \times 10^{-4}$ M, the concentration of hydroxide ions can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1 \times 10^{-4}} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \text{ M}\n$$\n\nIn neutral solutions, such as pure water at 25°C, the concentrations of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions are equal, both approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ M, resulting in a neutral pH of 7. In acidic solutions, the concentration of hydrogen ions exceeds that of hydroxide ions, leading to a pH less than 7, while in basic solutions, the concentration of hydroxide ions exceeds that of hydrogen ions, resulting in a pH greater than 7.\n\nThis relationship is crucial for understanding the acidity or basicity of solutions and is fundamental in various chemical and biological processes.
