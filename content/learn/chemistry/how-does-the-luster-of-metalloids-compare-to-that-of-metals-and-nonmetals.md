    How does the luster of metalloids compare to that of metals and non-metals?
answer: >-
    The luster of metalloids is generally reflective and shiny, similar to that of metals. This characteristic allows metalloids to exhibit a metallic luster, although they can also appear dull depending on the specific element. For instance, some forms of selenium can have a remarkable sheen, while others may not be as reflective.\n\nIn contrast, metals are typically shiny and have a strong metallic luster, making them easily distinguishable from non-metals, which are generally dull and lack any metallic shine. Non-metals do not exhibit luster and can come in various colors, often appearing non-reflective.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Metals**: Shiny with a strong metallic luster.\n- **Metalloids**: Usually shiny with a metallic luster, but can also be dull.\n- **Non-metals**: Generally non-lustrous and dull.\n\nThis distinction in luster is one of the key physical properties used to classify elements into metals, non-metals, and metalloids.
