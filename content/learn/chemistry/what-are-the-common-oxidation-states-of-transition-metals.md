    What are the common oxidation states of transition metals?
answer: >-
    Transition metals are known for their ability to exhibit multiple oxidation states, which is a key characteristic that influences their chemical reactivity and the formation of various compounds. The common oxidation states of transition metals arise primarily from the incomplete filling of their d orbitals, allowing them to lose different numbers of electrons.\n\n1. **Common Oxidation States**: \n   - The most prevalent oxidation states for first-row transition metals are typically +2 and +3. For example, iron (Fe) commonly exists in the +2 (Fe²⁺) and +3 (Fe³⁺) states, while manganese (Mn) can exhibit a wide range of oxidation states, from +2 to +7.\n   - Scandium (Sc) is an exception, as its most common oxidation state is +3, resulting from the loss of three electrons (two from the 4s orbital and one from the 3d orbital).\n\n2. **Variable Oxidation States**: \n   - Transition metals can have oxidation states that differ by one unit, which is a result of the relatively easy loss of d electrons. For instance, vanadium (V) can exist in oxidation states ranging from +2 to +5, each corresponding to different chemical species and colors in compounds.\n   - Higher oxidation states are often associated with the formation of covalent bonds with oxygen, as seen in compounds like the manganate (VII) ion (MnO₄⁻).\n\n3. **Stability of Oxidation States**: \n   - The stability of these oxidation states can vary significantly. For example, cations of second- and third-row transition metals in lower oxidation states (+2 and +3) are generally more easily oxidized compared to their first-row counterparts.\n\nIn summary, the common oxidation states of transition metals are crucial for understanding their reactivity and the types of compounds they can form. The ability to exist in multiple oxidation states is a defining feature of transition metals, contributing to their diverse applications in chemistry and industry.
