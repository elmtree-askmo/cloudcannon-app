    What distinguishes polar covalent bonds from nonpolar covalent bonds?
answer: >-
    Polar covalent bonds and nonpolar covalent bonds are distinguished primarily by the way electrons are shared between the atoms involved in the bond, which is influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms.\n\n1. **Polar Covalent Bonds**: In polar covalent bonds, electrons are shared unequally between two atoms. This unequal sharing occurs because one atom has a higher electronegativity than the other, meaning it has a stronger attraction for the shared electrons. As a result, the atom with the higher electronegativity acquires a partial negative charge (δ-), while the other atom acquires a partial positive charge (δ+). A common example of a polar covalent bond is found in water (H₂O), where the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, leading to a dipole moment in the molecule.\n\n2. **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: In contrast, nonpolar covalent bonds occur when electrons are shared equally between two atoms. This typically happens when the atoms involved have similar electronegativities, resulting in no charge separation within the molecule. An example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in molecular oxygen (O₂), where two oxygen atoms share electrons equally.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction lies in the equality of electron sharing:\n- **Polar Covalent Bonds**: Unequal sharing of electrons, leading to partial charges.\n- **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: Equal sharing of electrons, resulting in no charge separation. \n\nThis difference in electron sharing affects the physical and chemical properties of the molecules formed, including their solubility, boiling and melting points, and interactions with other molecules.
