    How are oxidation numbers determined?
answer: >-
    Oxidation numbers are determined using a set of established rules that help assign a numerical value to each atom in a molecule or ion, indicating its degree of oxidation or reduction during a chemical reaction. Here are the key rules for assigning oxidation numbers:\n\n1. **Uncombined Elements**: The oxidation number of an uncombined element is always zero. This applies to elements in their elemental form, such as Xe, Cl₂, and S₈.\n\n2. **Ions**: For ions, the oxidation number is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, the chloride ion (Cl⁻) has an oxidation number of -1, and the iron ion (Fe³⁺) has an oxidation number of +3.\n\n3. **Oxygen and Hydrogen**: In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, while hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1. There are exceptions, such as in peroxides where oxygen has an oxidation number of -1.\n\n4. **Sum of Oxidation Numbers**: The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound must equal zero, while in a polyatomic ion, it must equal the charge of the ion. For example, in the dichromate ion (Cr₂O₇²⁻), the total oxidation number for all chromium atoms must be +12 to balance the -14 contribution from the seven oxygen atoms, resulting in a total of -2 for the ion.\n\n5. **Group Oxidation States**: Elements in specific groups of the periodic table have predictable oxidation states. For example, alkali metals (Group 1) typically have an oxidation number of +1, and alkaline earth metals (Group 2) typically have an oxidation number of +2.\n\nBy applying these rules systematically, one can determine the oxidation number of each atom in a compound or ion, which is crucial for understanding redox reactions and the transfer of electrons during chemical processes.
