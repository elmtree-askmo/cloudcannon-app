answer: >-
    Balancing chemical equations is a fundamental skill in chemistry that ensures the law of conservation of mass is upheld. Here are the steps involved in balancing a chemical equation:\n\n1. **Write the Unbalanced Equation**: Start by writing the chemical equation with the reactants on the left side and the products on the right side. For example, for the combustion of methane, you would write: \n   $$\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$\n\n2. **Count the Atoms**: Count the number of atoms of each element present in the reactants and products. List these counts to keep track of the balance.\n\n3. **Identify the Most Complex Substance**: Focus on the most complex molecule (the one with the most different elements) to start balancing. This often helps simplify the process.\n\n4. **Balance One Element at a Time**: Choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product, if possible. Adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of the compounds) to balance the number of atoms of that element on both sides of the equation.\n\n5. **Repeat for Other Elements**: Continue this process for other elements, adjusting coefficients as necessary. It may be helpful to balance elements that appear in multiple compounds last, such as oxygen and hydrogen.\n\n6. **Check Your Work**: After adjusting coefficients, recount the atoms of each element on both sides of the equation to ensure they are equal. \n\n7. **Final Adjustments**: If necessary, make final adjustments to the coefficients to achieve balance. Ensure that all coefficients are in the simplest whole number ratio.\n\n8. **Write the Balanced Equation**: Once all elements are balanced, write the final balanced equation. For example, the balanced equation for the combustion of methane would be:\n   $$\text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}$$\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically balance any chemical equation, ensuring that the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation.
