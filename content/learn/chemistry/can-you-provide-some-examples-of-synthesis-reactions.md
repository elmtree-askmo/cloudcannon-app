answer: >-
    Synthesis reactions, also known as direct combination reactions, occur when two or more reactants combine to form a more complex product. The general form of a synthesis reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\nA + B \rightarrow AB\n$$\n\nHere are some notable examples of synthesis reactions:\n\n1. **Formation of Table Salt**: Sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl) to form sodium chloride (NaCl):\n   $$ \n   2Na (s) + Cl_2 (g) \rightarrow 2NaCl (s) \n   $$\n\n2. **Synthesis of Water**: Hydrogen (H₂) combines with oxygen (O₂) to produce water (H₂O):\n   $$ \n   2H_2 (g) + O_2 (g) \rightarrow 2H_2O (g) \n   $$\n\n3. **Formation of Iron(II) Sulfide**: Iron (Fe) reacts with sulfur (S) to form iron(II) sulfide (FeS):\n   $$ \n   8Fe (s) + S_8 (s) \rightarrow 8FeS (s) \n   $$\n\n4. **Synthesis of Hydrochloric Acid**: Hydrogen (H₂) reacts with chlorine (Cl₂) to form hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n   $$ \n   H_2 (g) + Cl_2 (g) \rightarrow 2HCl (g) \n   $$\n\n5. **Formation of Hydrogen Sulfate**: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) reacts with water (H₂O) to form sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄):\n   $$ \n   SO_2 (g) + H_2O (l) \rightarrow H_2SO_4 (aq) \n   $$\n\nThese examples illustrate how simple substances can combine to form more complex compounds, which is a fundamental aspect of many chemical processes in both nature and industry.
