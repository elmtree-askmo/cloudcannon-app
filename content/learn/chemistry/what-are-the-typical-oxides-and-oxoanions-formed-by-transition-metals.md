    What are the typical oxides and oxoanions formed by transition metals?
answer: >-
    Transition metals are known to form a variety of oxides and oxoanions, which are important in both chemical reactivity and applications. \n\n### Oxides of Transition Metals\nTransition metal oxides are typically formed through the reaction of transition metals with molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures. Most transition metals, except for Scandium (the first member of the 3d series), form ionic metal oxides. The oxidation states of the metal in these oxides can range from +2 to +7. \n\n- **Basic and Acidic Nature**: The lowest oxidation state oxides tend to be basic, while those in higher oxidation states can be amphoteric or acidic. For example, oxides like $FeO$ (iron(II) oxide) are basic, whereas $CrO_3$ (chromium trioxide) is acidic.\n\n### Oxoanions of Transition Metals\nOxoanions are formed when transition metals are in higher oxidation states, typically involving oxygen atoms bonded to the metal. For instance:\n- In the dichromate ion, $\ce{Cr2O7^{2-}}$, chromium has an oxidation state of +6.\n- In the permanganate ion, $\ce{MnO4^{-}}$, manganese exhibits an oxidation state of +7.\n\nThese oxoanions often have covalent characteristics due to the multiple bonding between oxygen and the metal, which is responsible for the high oxidation states observed in these compounds. \n\n### Summary of Key Points\n- Transition metal oxides are formed at high temperatures and can exhibit a range of oxidation states from +2 to +7.\n- The nature of the oxides varies with oxidation state, influencing their basic or acidic properties.\n- Oxoanions typically arise from transition metals in higher oxidation states and are characterized by their covalent bonding with oxygen.\n\nThese properties of transition metal oxides and oxoanions are crucial for their applications in catalysis, pigments, and various chemical processes.
