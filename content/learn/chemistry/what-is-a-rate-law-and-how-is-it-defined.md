    What is a rate law and how is it defined?
answer: >-
    A rate law, also known as a rate equation, is a mathematical expression that describes the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentrations of the reactants involved in that reaction. The general form of a rate law can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{rate} = k [A]^m [B]^n\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $\text{rate}$ represents the reaction rate, typically expressed in units of concentration per unit time (e.g., molarity/second).\n- $k$ is the rate constant, which is specific to the reaction at a given temperature.\n- $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the molar concentrations of the reactants A and B, respectively.\n- $m$ and $n$ are the reaction orders with respect to reactants A and B, indicating how the rate is affected by the concentration of each reactant.\n\nThe values of $m$ and $n$ are determined experimentally and do not necessarily correspond to the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in the balanced chemical equation. The overall order of the reaction is the sum of the individual orders, $m + n$.\n\nRate laws provide crucial insights into how changes in the concentrations of reactants influence the rate of a reaction. They are empirical in nature, meaning they must be determined through experimental data rather than predicted from the reaction's stoichiometry. For example, if a reaction has a rate law of $\text{rate} = k [NO]^2 [O_2]$, it indicates that the reaction is second order with respect to NO and first order with respect to O₂, making it a third-order reaction overall.\n\nIn summary, the rate law is a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics that helps chemists understand and predict the behavior of chemical reactions based on the concentrations of reactants.
