    How does temperature affect diffusion?
answer: >-
    Temperature significantly affects the rate of diffusion, which is the process by which particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. As temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules also increases. This heightened energy results in faster movement of the particles, leading to a more rapid rate of diffusion.\n\nThe relationship between temperature and diffusion can be described by the Arrhenius equation, which indicates that the diffusion rate increases exponentially with rising temperature. Specifically, at higher temperatures, particles collide more frequently due to their increased speed, which enhances the likelihood of successful diffusion events. Conversely, lower temperatures result in decreased kinetic energy, leading to slower diffusion rates.\n\nIn summary, the key points regarding the effect of temperature on diffusion are:\n\n1. **Increased Kinetic Energy**: Higher temperatures provide molecules with more energy, causing them to move faster.\n2. **Faster Diffusion Rates**: The increased speed of molecular motion leads to more frequent collisions and a quicker rate of diffusion.\n3. **Exponential Relationship**: The Arrhenius equation illustrates that the diffusion rate increases exponentially with temperature.\n\nOverall, understanding the impact of temperature on diffusion is crucial for various scientific and practical applications, including chemical reactions and biological processes.
