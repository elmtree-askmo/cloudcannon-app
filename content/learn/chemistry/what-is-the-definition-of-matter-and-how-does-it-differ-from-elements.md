    What is the definition of matter and how does it differ from elements?
answer: >-
    Matter is defined as any substance that has mass and occupies space. This includes a wide range of physical entities such as atoms, molecules, and compounds. Matter can exist in various states, primarily solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. It is characterized by its ability to have mass (rest mass) and to occupy volume.\n\nOn the other hand, an element is a specific type of matter that consists of only one type of atom. Elements are pure chemical substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Each element is defined by its unique atomic number, which corresponds to the number of protons in its atoms. For example, hydrogen (H) is an element with one proton, while oxygen (O) is an element with eight protons. \n\nIn summary, while all elements are matter, not all matter is an element. Matter encompasses a broader category that includes elements, compounds (which are made up of two or more different elements), and mixtures. Elements are the simplest forms of matter that retain their unique properties and cannot be decomposed into simpler substances.
