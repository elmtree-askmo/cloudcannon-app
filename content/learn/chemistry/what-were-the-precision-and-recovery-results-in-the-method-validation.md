answer: >-
    In the method validation for the rapid determination of phenolic compounds using RP-HPLC/DAD, the precision and recovery results were as follows:\n\n1. **Precision**: The overall intra-day and inter-day variation was reported to be less than 3%, indicating high precision in the method. Additionally, the validation experiments confirmed the accuracy and precision of the method, with precision values exceeding 97%.\n\n2. **Recovery**: The recovery value, which serves as an indicator of accuracy, was found to be 93.8% (w/w), falling within the acceptable range of 90-107% (w/w). This suggests that there were no significant matrix effects from other components in the extract. Other reported recovery values ranged from 96% to 102%, which were also close to 100%, further confirming the method's reliability.\n\nThese results demonstrate that the validated RP-HPLC/DAD method is both precise and accurate for the determination of phenolic compounds in grape products.
