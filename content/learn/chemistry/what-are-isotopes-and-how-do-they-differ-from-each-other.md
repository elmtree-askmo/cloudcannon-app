    What are isotopes and how do they differ from each other?
answer: >-
    Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. This difference in neutron count leads to variations in their atomic masses. Here’s a detailed explanation of isotopes and how they differ from each other:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Isotopes\n1. **Proton Count**: All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons, which defines the element itself. For example, all carbon isotopes have 6 protons.\n\n2. **Neutron Count**: Isotopes differ in the number of neutrons they contain. For instance:\n   - **Carbon-12 (¹²C)**: 6 protons and 6 neutrons (atomic mass = 12 amu).\n   - **Carbon-14 (¹⁴C)**: 6 protons and 8 neutrons (atomic mass = 14 amu).\n\n3. **Atomic Mass**: The variation in neutron numbers results in different atomic masses for the isotopes of the same element. This is crucial in applications such as radiocarbon dating, where the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 is used to determine the age of organic materials.\n\n4. **Stability**: Isotopes can be stable or radioactive. Stable isotopes do not change over time, while radioactive isotopes (or radioisotopes) have unstable nuclei that decay into other elements or isotopes, emitting radiation in the process. For example, carbon-14 is radioactive and decays over time, while carbon-12 is stable.\n\n5. **Physical Properties**: The differences in neutron numbers can lead to variations in physical properties, such as density and stability. For example, heavier isotopes may have different boiling and melting points compared to their lighter counterparts.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Composition**: Isotopes differ in the number of neutrons, while ions differ in the number of electrons.\n- **Charge**: Isotopes are neutral (no charge), whereas ions carry a positive or negative charge.\n- **Chemical Behavior**: Isotopes behave similarly in chemical reactions due to having the same electron configuration, while ions can exhibit different reactivity based on their charge and electron configuration.\n\n### Common Isotopes of Hydrogen\nHydrogen has three common isotopes, each differing in the number of neutrons:\n1. **Protium (¹H)**: 1 proton, 0 neutrons (atomic mass ≈ 1 amu).\n2. **Deuterium (²H)**: 1 proton, 1 neutron (atomic mass ≈ 2 amu).\n3. **Tritium (³H)**: 1 proton, 2 neutrons (atomic mass ≈ 3 amu, radioactive).\n\nIn conclusion, isotopes are essential in various scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, and medicine, due to their unique properties and behaviors.
