    What are the key properties of non-metals?
answer: >-
    Non-metals are a distinct category of elements located primarily on the right side of the periodic table. They exhibit a variety of unique physical and chemical properties that differentiate them from metals. Here are the key properties of non-metals:\n\n1. **Physical State**: Non-metals can exist in all three states of matter at room temperature: solid (e.g., sulfur, phosphorus), liquid (e.g., bromine), and gas (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen). \n\n2. **Brittleness**: Non-metals are generally brittle when in solid form, meaning they cannot be easily shaped or drawn into wires (non-malleable and non-ductile). This brittleness is a significant contrast to metals, which are typically malleable and ductile.\n\n3. **Electrical Conductivity**: Non-metals are poor conductors of electricity. They have low to moderate bulk electrical conductivities, which can increase with temperature. This is in stark contrast to metals, which are excellent conductors.\n\n4. **Ionization Energy and Electronegativity**: Non-metals have high ionization energies and high electronegativity values. This means they tend to gain electrons during chemical reactions, forming negative ions (anions) and covalent bonds with other non-metals.\n\n5. **Melting and Boiling Points**: Non-metals generally have lower melting and boiling points compared to metals. This property varies widely among non-metals, with some (like carbon in the form of diamond) having very high melting points, while others (like gases) have very low melting and boiling points.\n\n6. **Color and Luster**: Non-metals are typically non-lustrous and can appear in various colors. They do not exhibit the shiny appearance characteristic of metals.\n\n7. **Chemical Behavior**: Non-metals tend to form acidic oxides, while metals typically form basic oxides. This difference in chemical behavior is crucial in understanding their reactivity and the types of compounds they form.\n\n8. **Examples**: Common non-metals include hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halogens (e.g., chlorine, fluorine).\n\nIn summary, non-metals are characterized by their poor conductivity, brittleness, high ionization energies, and a tendency to gain electrons, which collectively define their unique role in chemical bonding and reactions.
