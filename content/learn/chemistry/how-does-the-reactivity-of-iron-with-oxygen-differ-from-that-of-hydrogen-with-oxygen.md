    How does the reactivity of iron with oxygen differ from that of hydrogen with oxygen?
answer: >-
    The reactivity of iron with oxygen differs significantly from that of hydrogen with oxygen in several key aspects, including the nature of the reactions, the products formed, and the energy changes involved.\n\n### Reactivity of Iron with Oxygen\n1. **Medium Reactivity**: Iron has a medium reactivity with oxygen. When iron is heated in the presence of oxygen, it can form various iron oxides, such as iron(II) oxide (FeO) and iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃). The general reaction can be represented as:\n   $$\n   4 \text{Fe} + 3 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3\n   $$\n   Additionally, iron can corrode in the presence of moisture, leading to the formation of rust, which is hydrated iron(III) oxide:\n   $$\n   4 \text{Fe} + 3 \text{O}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4 \text{Fe(OH)}_3\n   $$\n\n2. **Energy Release**: The reaction of iron with oxygen is exothermic, but the energy released is not as high as that of hydrogen. Iron reacts readily when heated, producing orange sparks and forming a black solid (iron oxide).\n\n3. **Corrosion**: Iron is prone to corrosion, which is a slow reaction with oxygen and moisture, leading to the gradual deterioration of the metal.\n\n### Reactivity of Hydrogen with Oxygen\n1. **High Reactivity**: Hydrogen is highly reactive and combines readily with oxygen to form water. The reaction is represented as:\n   $$\n   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\n   $$\n\n2. **Exothermic Reaction**: The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen is highly exothermic, releasing a significant amount of energy (approximately 286 kJ per mole of water formed). This reaction can occur explosively under certain conditions, especially when a spark is introduced.\n\n3. **Activation Energy**: Hydrogen has a low activation energy, meaning that it requires only a small spark to initiate the reaction with oxygen. Once initiated, the reaction can propagate rapidly, releasing energy and producing water vapor.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Nature of Reactivity**: Iron reacts moderately with oxygen, while hydrogen reacts vigorously.\n- **Products**: Iron forms various oxides and rust, while hydrogen forms water.\n- **Energy Changes**: The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is more exothermic and can be explosive, whereas iron's reaction is less energetic and typically does not lead to explosive outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, while both iron and hydrogen react with oxygen, the differences in their reactivity, the nature of the products formed, and the energy changes involved highlight the distinct chemical behaviors of these elements.
