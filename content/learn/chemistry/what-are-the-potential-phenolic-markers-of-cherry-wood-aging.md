    What are the potential phenolic markers of cherry wood aging?
answer: >-
    The potential phenolic markers of cherry wood aging have been identified through various studies, highlighting specific compounds that can serve as indicators of the aging process in wines. Notably, a study by Sanz et al. (2014) identified six non-volatile phenolic compounds that can be regarded as chemical markers of cherry wood aging. These compounds include:\n\n1. **Taxifolin**\n2. **Prunin**\n3. **Aromadendrin**\n4. **Eriodictyol**\n5. **Naringenin**\n6. **Isosakuranetin**\n\nIn addition to these markers, other phenolic compounds have been analyzed during the aging process of wines in cherry wood. For instance, naringenin and kaempferol have been noted as specific wood markers associated with cherry wood. The aging process in cherry wood has been shown to promote a faster oxidation of red wine phenolics, which can influence the overall phenolic composition and sensory profile of the wine.\n\nFurthermore, taxifolin has been identified for the first time as a marker in vinegar aged in cherry wood, indicating its broader applicability as a phenolic marker beyond just wine. Overall, the use of cherry wood in enology has resulted in a greater diversity of phenolic compounds, contributing to unique sensory attributes in the wines produced.\n\nIn summary, the phenolic markers of cherry wood aging include a variety of compounds that not only enhance the flavor profile of wines but also serve as indicators of the aging process itself.
