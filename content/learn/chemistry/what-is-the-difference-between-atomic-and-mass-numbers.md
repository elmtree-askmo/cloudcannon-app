    What is the difference between atomic and mass numbers?
answer: >-
    The atomic number and mass number are two fundamental concepts in atomic structure that help define the characteristics of an element.\n\n1. **Atomic Number (Z)**: The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It uniquely identifies an element and determines its position in the periodic table. For example, the atomic number of carbon is 6, meaning it has 6 protons. The atomic number is always a whole number.\n\n2. **Mass Number (A)**: The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus. It is represented as a whole number and is used to identify the specific isotope of an element. For instance, if a carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, its mass number would be 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12). \n\nIn summary, while the atomic number indicates the number of protons and defines the element, the mass number provides information about the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus. The mass number can vary among isotopes of the same element, which have the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons. \n\nTo illustrate this with notation, the mass number is typically written as a superscript and the atomic number as a subscript next to the element symbol, such as $$\ce{^{12}_{6}C}$$ for carbon-12.
