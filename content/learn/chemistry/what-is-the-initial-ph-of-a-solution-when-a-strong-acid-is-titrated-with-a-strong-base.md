    What is the initial pH of a solution when a strong acid is titrated with a strong base?
answer: >-
    The initial pH of a solution when a strong acid is titrated with a strong base can be calculated based on the concentration of the strong acid present in the solution. For example, if we consider a solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a concentration of 0.100 M, we can determine the initial pH as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding Strong Acids**: Strong acids, such as HCl, completely dissociate in water. Therefore, the concentration of hydrogen ions $[H^+]$ in the solution is equal to the concentration of the acid.\n\n2. **Calculating pH**: The pH is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   pH = -\log[H^+]\n   $$\n   For a 0.100 M HCl solution:\n   $$\n   pH = -\log(0.100) = 1.00\n   $$\n\nThus, the initial pH of a 0.100 M HCl solution before any titrant (strong base) is added is **1.00**.\n\nThis approach can be generalized for any strong acid by substituting the concentration of the acid into the pH formula. The initial pH will always reflect the concentration of the strong acid present in the solution before any base is added.
