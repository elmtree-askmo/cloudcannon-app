question: >-
    Provide examples of compounds and their chemical formulas.
answer: >-
    Compounds are pure substances formed when two or more elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. Here are some examples of compounds along with their chemical formulas:\n\n1. **Water** - H₂O\n   - Composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n\n2. **Carbon Dioxide** - CO₂\n   - Composed of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3. **Sodium Chloride (table salt)** - NaCl\n   - Composed of one sodium atom and one chlorine atom.\n\n4. **Glucose** - C₆H₁₂O₆\n   - Composed of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.\n\n5. **Ammonia** - NH₃\n   - Composed of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.\n\n6. **Ethanol (alcohol)** - C₂H₅OH\n   - Composed of two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.\n\n7. **Sulfuric Acid** - H₂SO₄\n   - Composed of two hydrogen atoms, one sulfur atom, and four oxygen atoms.\n\n8. **Calcium Carbonate** - CaCO₃\n   - Composed of one calcium atom, one carbon atom, and three oxygen atoms.\n\nThese examples illustrate the diversity of compounds, which can vary significantly in their properties and uses based on their constituent elements and the way those elements are bonded together.
