    What defines a solution in chemical terms?
answer: >-
    In chemical terms, a solution is defined as a homogeneous mixture consisting of two or more substances, where one substance, known as the solute, is dissolved in another substance, referred to as the solvent. This definition is supported by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which describes a solution as "a liquid or solid phase containing more than one substance, when for convenience one (or more) substance, which is called the solvent, is treated differently from the other substances, which are called solutes."\n\nKey characteristics of a solution include:\n\n1. **Homogeneity**: A solution is a homogeneous mixture, meaning that any sample taken from the solution will have the same composition and properties throughout. This uniformity ensures that the particles of the solute are evenly distributed within the solvent.\n\n2. **Single Phase**: Solutions exist in a single phase, which can be solid, liquid, or gas. For example, air is a gaseous solution, while sugar dissolved in water forms a liquid solution.\n\n3. **Invisible Particles**: The particles of the solute in a solution are typically not visible to the naked eye, and they do not scatter light, which distinguishes solutions from suspensions or colloids.\n\n4. **Separation**: The components of a solution cannot be separated by simple filtration methods, as they are mixed at the molecular level.\n\n5. **Variable Composition**: The relative amounts of solute and solvent can vary, up to a limit known as the solubility limit, beyond which no more solute can dissolve in the solvent.\n\nExamples of solutions include saltwater (where salt is the solute and water is the solvent), air (where gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide are solutes in nitrogen), and metal alloys (which are solid solutions). \n\nOverall, the concept of a solution is fundamental in chemistry, as it plays a crucial role in various chemical reactions and processes.
