answer: >-
    Yes, there are exceptions to the general rule that metals are conductors and non-metals are insulators. While it is true that most metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity due to their free-moving electrons, some non-metals can also exhibit conductive properties under certain conditions.\n\nOne notable exception among non-metals is graphite, which is an allotropic form of carbon. Graphite is a good conductor of electricity because it has a layered structure that allows electrons to move freely between the layers. This property makes graphite useful in applications such as batteries and electrodes.\n\nAdditionally, iodine, although primarily a non-metal, can exhibit metallic luster and has unique properties that differentiate it from other non-metals. However, it is not a conductor in the same way graphite is.\n\nIn summary, while metals are generally good conductors and non-metals are poor conductors, exceptions like graphite demonstrate that some non-metals can conduct electricity effectively.
