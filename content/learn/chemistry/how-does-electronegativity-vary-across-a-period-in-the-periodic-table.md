    How does electronegativity vary across a period in the periodic table?
answer: >-
    Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons when it is part of a compound. In the periodic table, electronegativity exhibits a clear trend as one moves across a period from left to right.\n\n1. **Trend Across a Period**: Electronegativity increases as you move from left to right across a period. This trend is primarily due to two factors:\n   - **Increasing Nuclear Charge**: As you move across a period, the atomic number increases, which means there are more protons in the nucleus. This increase in positive charge enhances the nucleus's ability to attract electrons.\n   - **Decreasing Atomic Size**: The atomic radius decreases across a period because the added electrons are being added to the same energy level while the nuclear charge increases. A smaller atomic size means that the distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons is reduced, leading to a stronger attraction for bonding electrons.\n\n2. **Exceptions**: While the trend generally holds, there are exceptions. Noble gases, located at the far right of the periodic table, do not typically form bonds and thus do not have defined electronegativity values. Additionally, elements in the lanthanide and actinide series may also exhibit irregularities in electronegativity trends.\n\n3. **Example**: For instance, in period 3 of the periodic table, the electronegativity values increase from sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl), with chlorine being one of the most electronegative elements.\n\nIn summary, the trend of increasing electronegativity across a period is a result of the increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic size, which together enhance an atom's ability to attract electrons.
