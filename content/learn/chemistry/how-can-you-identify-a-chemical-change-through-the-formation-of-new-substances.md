    To identify a chemical change through the formation of new substances, one can look for several key indicators that signal a chemical reaction has occurred. Here are the primary signs to consider:\n\n1. **Formation of New Substances**: The most definitive sign of a chemical change is the production of one or more new substances with different chemical compositions than the reactants. For example, when iron (Fe) reacts with oxygen (O2) to form rust (iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3), the original substances are transformed into a new substance, indicating a chemical change. This can be represented by the equation:\n   $$\n   4 \text{Fe}(s) + 3 \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)\n   $$\n\n2. **Observable Changes**: Chemical changes are often accompanied by observable phenomena, such as:\n   - **Color Change**: A change in color can indicate a new substance has formed. For instance, the oxidation of a copper penny changes its color from shiny brown to green due to the formation of copper carbonate.\n   - **Gas Production**: The evolution of gas bubbles during a reaction is a strong indicator of a chemical change. For example, when vinegar reacts with baking soda, carbon dioxide gas is produced.\n   - **Precipitate Formation**: The formation of a solid from a solution during a chemical reaction is known as precipitation. For example, mixing solutions of barium chloride and sodium sulfate results in the formation of barium sulfate, a solid precipitate.\n\n3. **Change in Temperature**: A noticeable change in temperature, either an increase (exothermic reaction) or decrease (endothermic reaction), can indicate a chemical change. This occurs due to the release or absorption of energy during the reaction.\n\n4. **Irreversibility**: Many chemical changes are irreversible under normal conditions. For example, once wood is burned, it cannot be reverted back to its original form. In contrast, physical changes, such as melting or freezing, are often reversible.\n\n5. **Change in Properties**: The physical and chemical properties of the substances involved change during a chemical reaction. For instance, the properties of rust (iron(III) oxide) are different from those of iron and oxygen.\n\nIn summary, the identification of a chemical change is primarily based on the formation of new substances, observable changes, temperature variations, and the irreversibility of the process. Understanding these indicators is crucial for distinguishing chemical changes from physical changes, where no new substances are formed, and the original substance retains its chemical identity.
