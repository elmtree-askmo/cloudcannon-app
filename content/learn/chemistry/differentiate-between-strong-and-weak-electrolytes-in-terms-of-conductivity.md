    Differentiate between strong and weak electrolytes in terms of conductivity.
answer: >-
    Strong and weak electrolytes differ significantly in terms of their conductivity when dissolved in water, which is primarily due to the extent of their dissociation into ions.\n\n### Strong Electrolytes\nStrong electrolytes are substances that completely dissociate into ions when dissolved in water. This complete dissociation results in a high concentration of free ions in the solution, which facilitates the conduction of electricity. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) dissociates fully into sodium ions (Na⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻):\n\n$$\n\text{NaCl (s)} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ (aq) + \text{Cl}^- (aq)\n$$\n\nBecause of this high concentration of ions, strong electrolytes exhibit high electrical conductivity, making them effective in applications such as batteries and biological systems.\n\n### Weak Electrolytes\nIn contrast, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in solution. This partial dissociation leads to a lower concentration of free ions, resulting in lower electrical conductivity compared to strong electrolytes. A common example of a weak electrolyte is acetic acid (CH₃COOH), which ionizes in water as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{CH}_3\text{COOH (aq)} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- (aq) + \text{H}^+ (aq)\n$$\n\nSince only a fraction of the acetic acid molecules dissociate into ions, the overall conductivity of the solution is much lower than that of a strong electrolyte.\n\n### Summary\n- **Strong Electrolytes**: Completely dissociate into ions, resulting in high conductivity (e.g., NaCl, KNO₃).\n- **Weak Electrolytes**: Partially dissociate into ions, resulting in lower conductivity (e.g., CH₃COOH).\n\nThis distinction is crucial in understanding the behavior of different substances in aqueous solutions and their applications in various chemical and biological processes.
