    How do the oxidation states of lanthanoids compare to those of actinoids?
answer: >-
    The oxidation states of lanthanoids and actinoids exhibit notable differences. \n\nLanthanoids predominantly showcase a +3 oxidation state, which is the most common among them. In addition to this, they can also exhibit +2 and +4 oxidation states, although they do not possess a +6 oxidation state. This limitation affects their ability to form complex compounds, as they are less versatile in their oxidation states compared to actinoids.\n\nIn contrast, actinoids display a broader range of oxidation states, typically ranging from +2 to +7. The most frequent oxidation state for actinoids is also +3, similar to lanthanoids. However, actinoids can achieve higher oxidation states such as +4, +5, and +6, which allows them to form a greater variety of complex compounds. The presence of 5f, 6d, and 7s electrons participating in bonding contributes to this increased variability in oxidation states.\n\nIn summary, while both lanthanoids and actinoids commonly exhibit a +3 oxidation state, lanthanoids are limited primarily to +2, +3, and +4 states, whereas actinoids can access a wider range of oxidation states, including +5 and +6, enhancing their chemical reactivity and ability to form complexes.
