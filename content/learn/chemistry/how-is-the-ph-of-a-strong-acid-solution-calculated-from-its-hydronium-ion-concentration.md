    How is the pH of a strong acid solution calculated from its hydronium ion concentration?
answer: >-
    To calculate the pH of a strong acid solution from its hydronium ion concentration, you can use the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]$ is the concentration of hydronium ions in moles per liter (M).\n\n### Steps to Calculate pH from Hydronium Ion Concentration:\n\n1. **Determine the Hydronium Ion Concentration**: For a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), it completely dissociates in solution. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions is equal to the concentration of the acid. For example, if you have a 0.1 M solution of HCl, then $[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = 0.1 \, \text{M}$.\n\n2. **Apply the pH Formula**: Substitute the hydronium ion concentration into the pH formula. For the example above:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(0.1) = 1\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation:\nIf you have a 0.03 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl):\n- Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, so $[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = 0.03 \, \text{M}$.\n- Calculate the pH:\n  $$\n  \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(0.03) \approx 1.52\n  $$\n\n### Summary:\nThe pH of a strong acid solution can be easily calculated using the concentration of hydronium ions. The lower the pH value, the stronger the acid, reflecting a higher concentration of hydronium ions in the solution.
