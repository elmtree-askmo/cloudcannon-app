    Explain the chemical change that occurs when hydrogen and oxygen form water.
answer: >-
    When hydrogen and oxygen react to form water, a chemical change occurs that transforms the reactants into a new substance with different properties. This reaction can be represented by the balanced chemical equation:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\n### Explanation of the Chemical Change\n\n1. **Reactants and Products**: In this reaction, the reactants are diatomic hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) and diatomic oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$). The product formed is liquid water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). The properties of water are significantly different from those of hydrogen and oxygen gases. For instance, water is a liquid at room temperature, while both hydrogen and oxygen are gases.\n\n2. **Chemical Bonds**: During the reaction, the chemical bonds between the hydrogen atoms in $\text{H}_2$ and the oxygen atoms in $\text{O}_2$ are broken. New bonds are formed between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create water molecules. This process involves the rearrangement of atoms, which is a hallmark of a chemical change.\n\n3. **Conservation of Mass**: The balanced equation shows that the number of atoms of each element is conserved. There are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation, adhering to the law of conservation of mass. This means that the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products.\n\n4. **Chemical Properties**: The formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen is a demonstration of a chemical property of both elements. Hydrogen and oxygen can exist independently as gases, but when they react, they form a completely different substance—water—which has unique physical and chemical properties.\n\n5. **Exothermic Reaction**: The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen is exothermic, meaning it releases energy in the form of heat and light. This is why hydrogen combustion is often used as a fuel source.\n\nIn summary, the chemical change that occurs when hydrogen and oxygen form water involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds, resulting in the creation of a new substance with distinct properties, while adhering to the principles of mass conservation.
