    What distinguishes physical reactions from chemical reactions?
answer: >-
    The distinction between physical reactions and chemical reactions lies primarily in the changes that occur at the molecular level and the resulting properties of the substances involved.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Physical Reactions**: These involve changes that do not alter the chemical composition of the substance. For example, boiling water or dissolving salt in water are physical changes. In these cases, the original substances can be recovered (e.g., water can be condensed back from vapor, and salt can be recovered by evaporating the water).\n   - **Chemical Reactions**: These involve a change in the composition of the substances, resulting in the formation of new substances with different properties. Examples include burning wood or rusting iron, where the original substances are transformed into entirely different materials.\n\n2. **Characteristics**:\n   - **Physical Changes**:\n     - Do not produce new substances.\n     - Often reversible (e.g., freezing and melting).\n     - Changes may include alterations in state (solid, liquid, gas), shape, or appearance without changing the substance's identity.\n     - Energy changes are typically minimal.\n   - **Chemical Changes**:\n     - Result in the formation of new substances.\n     - Generally irreversible (e.g., once wood is burned, it cannot be turned back into wood).\n     - Involve breaking and forming of chemical bonds, leading to changes in the molecular structure.\n     - Often accompanied by energy changes, such as heat absorption or release.\n\n3. **Examples**:\n   - **Physical Changes**: Melting ice, boiling water, dissolving sugar in water, and shredding paper.\n   - **Chemical Changes**: Combustion of fuels, digestion of food, rusting of iron, and fermentation.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that physical reactions do not change the chemical identity of a substance, while chemical reactions do, resulting in new substances with distinct properties.
