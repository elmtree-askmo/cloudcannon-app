    What is the Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid and a base?
answer: >-
    The Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases is centered around the concept of proton transfer. According to this model:\n\n- **Acids** are defined as proton donors. This means that an acid is a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (H⁺) to another substance during a chemical reaction.\n  \n- **Bases** are defined as proton acceptors. A base is a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion from an acid.\n\nThis model allows for a broader understanding of acid-base behavior beyond the limitations of other theories, such as the Arrhenius definition, which only considers substances that produce H⁺ or OH⁻ ions in water.\n\nFor example, in the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water (H₂O), HCl acts as a Bronsted-Lowry acid by donating a proton to water, resulting in the formation of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻):\n\n$$\n\text{HCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{Cl}^-\n$$\n\nIn this reaction, HCl is the acid (proton donor), and water is the base (proton acceptor). After the reaction, HCl becomes its conjugate base (Cl⁻), and water becomes its conjugate acid (H₃O⁺). This illustrates the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs, which is a key feature of the Bronsted-Lowry model.
