    A single replacement reaction is a chemical process where one element substitutes another in a compound, resulting in a new element and compound, often represented as A + BC  AC + B.

    What is the definition of a single replacement reaction?
answer: >-
    A single replacement reaction, also known as a single displacement reaction, is a type of chemical reaction in which one element is substituted for another element in a compound. This process results in the formation of a new element and a new compound as products. The general form of a single replacement reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\nA + BC \rightarrow AC + B\n$$\n\nIn this equation, element A replaces element B in the compound BC, leading to the formation of a new compound AC and the release of element B.\n\nFor example, the reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\ce{2HCl(aq) + Zn(s) â†’ ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)}\n$$\n\nIn this reaction, zinc (Zn) displaces hydrogen (H) from hydrochloric acid (HCl), resulting in the formation of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and hydrogen gas (H2).\n\nSingle replacement reactions typically occur when the replacing element is more reactive than the element it is displacing. These reactions are often exothermic, meaning they release energy in the form of heat or light.
