    Describe the formation and characteristics of a hydroxide ion.
answer: >-
    The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is a negatively charged ion that plays a crucial role in acid-base chemistry and the basicity of solutions. It is formed during the auto-ionization of water, a process where two water molecules interact, resulting in the transfer of a hydrogen ion (H⁺) from one molecule to another. This reaction can be represented as:\n\n$$\n2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n$$\n\nIn this process, one water molecule donates a hydrogen ion, becoming a hydroxide ion, while the other water molecule accepts the hydrogen ion, forming a hydronium ion (H₃O⁺).\n\n### Characteristics of Hydroxide Ion:\n\n1. **Charge and Composition**: The hydroxide ion carries a single negative charge and consists of one oxygen atom covalently bonded to one hydrogen atom.\n\n2. **Role in Basicity**: Hydroxide ions are fundamental in determining the basicity of a solution. In basic solutions, the concentration of hydroxide ions is greater than that of hydronium ions. This is in contrast to acidic solutions, where the concentration of hydronium ions exceeds that of hydroxide ions.\n\n3. **pH Scale**: The presence of hydroxide ions in a solution contributes to a higher pH value (greater than 7), indicating a basic solution. The relationship between hydroxide ion concentration and pH can be described using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-]\n$$\n\n4. **Neutral Solutions**: In pure water at 25 degrees Celsius, the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions are equal, each approximately $1 \times 10^{-7}$ molar, resulting in a neutral pH of 7.\n\n5. **Chemical Reactions**: Hydroxide ions can participate in various chemical reactions, including neutralization reactions where they react with acids to form water and salts. For example, when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates in water, it releases hydroxide ions:\n\n$$\n\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{OH}^-\n$$\n\n6. **Biological Importance**: Hydroxide ions are also significant in biological systems, influencing enzyme activity and metabolic processes.\n\nIn summary, the hydroxide ion is a key player in the chemistry of water and solutions, affecting pH, basicity, and various chemical reactions. Its formation during the auto-ionization of water is a fundamental concept in understanding acid-base chemistry.
