    How does the luster of non-metals compare to that of metals?
answer: >-
    The luster of non-metals is significantly different from that of metals. Metals are characterized by their shiny, metallic luster, which makes them visually appealing and desirable for various applications, such as decorative items and jewelry. For example, metals like gold, silver, and aluminum exhibit a distinct shine due to their ability to reflect light effectively.\n\nIn contrast, non-metals typically do not possess this shiny appearance. They are generally dull and lack luster, which can be attributed to their different electronic structures and bonding characteristics. Non-metals, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, exhibit a variety of colors but do not reflect light in the same way that metals do.\n\nTo summarize, metals are shiny and lustrous, while non-metals are dull and non-lustrous, making this a key distinguishing feature between the two categories of elements.
