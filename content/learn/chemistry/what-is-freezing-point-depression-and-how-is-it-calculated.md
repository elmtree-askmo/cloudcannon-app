    Freezing point depression is a colligative property that describes how the addition of a solute lowers the freezing point of a solvent. It is calculated using the formula Tf = i  Kf  m, where i is the van't Hoff factor, Kf is the molal freezing-point depression constant of the solvent, and m is the molality of the solution.

answer: >-
    Freezing point depression is a phenomenon where the freezing point of a solvent is lowered when a solute is added. This effect is classified as a colligative property, meaning it depends on the number of solute particles in a solution rather than the identity of the solute itself. The freezing point depression can be quantitatively described using the formula:\n\n$$\n\Delta T_f = i \times K_f \times m\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\Delta T_f$ is the freezing point depression (the difference between the freezing point of the pure solvent and that of the solution),\n- $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (which accounts for the number of particles the solute dissociates into in solution),\n- $K_f$ is the molal freezing-point depression constant specific to the solvent, and\n- $m$ is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent).\n\nFor example, when salt (NaCl) is dissolved in water, it dissociates into two ions (Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$), resulting in a van't Hoff factor $i = 2$. In contrast, sugar (C$_{12}$H$_{22}$O$_{11}$) does not dissociate, so its $i$ value is 1. This means that the freezing point depression caused by dissolving salt is greater than that caused by dissolving sugar at the same molality.\n\nThe freezing point depression constant $K_f$ varies for different solvents. For instance, the $K_f$ for naphthalene is 7 °C·kg/mol. \n\nTo calculate the freezing point of a solution, you would first determine the molality of the solute, apply the formula to find $\Delta T_f$, and then subtract this value from the freezing point of the pure solvent. For example, if you have a solution with a molality of 0.450 mol/kg of urea in water (which has a normal freezing point of 0 °C), you would calculate the freezing point depression and then find the new freezing point of the solution.\n\nIn summary, freezing point depression is a crucial concept in thermochemistry and has practical applications, such as in the use of salt to prevent ice formation on roads during winter.
