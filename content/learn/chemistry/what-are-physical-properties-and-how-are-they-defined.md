    What are physical properties and how are they defined?
answer: >-
    Physical properties are characteristics of matter that can be observed and measured without altering the chemical identity of a substance. These properties are essential for identifying and describing materials in various scientific contexts. Examples of physical properties include:\n\n- **Color**: The visual appearance of a substance.\n- **Density**: The mass per unit volume of a substance, often expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cmÂ³).\n- **Hardness**: A measure of a material's resistance to deformation or scratching.\n- **Melting Point**: The temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid.\n- **Boiling Point**: The temperature at which a liquid turns into vapor.\n- **Temperature**: A measure of the thermal energy of a substance.\n- **Reflectivity**: The ability of a surface to reflect light.\n- **Elasticity**: The ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation.\n- **Ductility**: The ability of a material to be stretched into a wire.\n\nPhysical properties can be categorized into two types: **intensive properties**, which do not depend on the amount of substance (e.g., density, color), and **extensive properties**, which do depend on the amount of substance (e.g., mass, volume).\n\nIn summary, physical properties are observable characteristics that do not involve a change in the chemical composition of the material, making them crucial for understanding and manipulating substances in both everyday and scientific applications.
