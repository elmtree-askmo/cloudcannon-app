    What are the differences between physical and chemical properties of matter?
answer: >-
    The differences between physical and chemical properties of matter are fundamental to understanding the characteristics and behaviors of substances. Here’s a detailed comparison:\n\n### Physical Properties\n1. **Definition**: Physical properties are characteristics that can be observed or measured without changing the chemical composition of the substance.\n2. **Observation**: These properties can be detected using the senses or measured with instruments. Examples include:\n   - **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object.\n   - **Volume**: The space occupied by a substance.\n   - **Color**: The visual appearance of a substance.\n   - **State of Matter**: Solid, liquid, or gas.\n   - **Melting Point and Boiling Point**: Temperatures at which a substance changes state.\n   - **Density**: Mass per unit volume.\n   - **Odor**: The smell of a substance.\n3. **Types**: Physical properties can be classified into:\n   - **Intensive Properties**: Independent of the amount of substance (e.g., density, color).\n   - **Extensive Properties**: Dependent on the amount of substance (e.g., mass, volume).\n\n### Chemical Properties\n1. **Definition**: Chemical properties describe the ability of a substance to undergo chemical changes and form new substances.\n2. **Observation**: These properties can only be observed when a chemical reaction occurs, which alters the chemical identity of the substance. Examples include:\n   - **Reactivity**: The ability of a substance to react with other substances (e.g., oxygen, acids).\n   - **Flammability**: The ability to ignite and burn.\n   - **Acidity**: The ability to donate protons (H⁺ ions) in a reaction.\n   - **Toxicity**: The degree to which a substance can harm living organisms.\n   - **Rusting**: The ability of iron to react with oxygen and moisture to form rust.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Change in Composition**: Physical properties can be observed without changing the substance, while chemical properties require a change in the substance's chemical structure.\n- **Measurement**: Physical properties are measurable without a reaction, whereas chemical properties are only measurable during or after a chemical reaction.\n- **Examples**: Common physical properties include color, mass, and volume, while chemical properties include reactivity and flammability.\n\nIn summary, understanding the distinction between physical and chemical properties is crucial for identifying and describing matter, as well as predicting how substances will behave in different situations.
