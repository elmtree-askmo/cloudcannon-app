    How are ions formed and what determines their electrical charge?
answer: >-
    Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge. This process alters the balance between protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged) in the atom. \n\n### Formation of Ions\n1. **Cations**: These are positively charged ions that occur when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, sodium (Na) can lose an electron to form a sodium cation (Na⁺).\n2. **Anions**: These are negatively charged ions formed when an atom gains one or more electrons. For instance, chlorine (Cl) can gain an electron to become a chloride anion (Cl⁻).\n\n### Determinants of Electrical Charge\nThe electrical charge of an ion is determined by the difference between the number of protons and electrons:\n- If an atom loses electrons, it has more protons than electrons, resulting in a positive charge (cation).\n- If an atom gains electrons, it has more electrons than protons, resulting in a negative charge (anion).\n\n### Chemical Properties\nIons exhibit different chemical properties compared to their neutral atoms due to changes in electron configuration. This alteration affects their reactivity and the types of chemical bonds they can form, which is crucial in various chemical processes, including ionic bonding.\n\nIn summary, ions are created through the gain or loss of electrons, and their electrical charge is determined by the resulting imbalance between protons and electrons.
