    What does reactivity indicate about a substance's chemical properties?
answer: >-
    Reactivity is a fundamental aspect of a substance's chemical properties, indicating its tendency to undergo chemical reactions with other substances. This characteristic is crucial for understanding how substances interact and transform during chemical processes.\n\n1. **Definition of Reactivity**: Reactivity refers to the ability of a substance to participate in chemical reactions. Highly reactive substances can easily form new compounds, while inert substances exhibit little to no reactivity. For example, sodium (Na) is highly reactive with water, leading to the formation of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2) as shown in the reaction:\n\n   $$\n   2 \text{Na}(s) + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2 \text{NaOH}(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)\n   $$\n\n2. **Chemical Properties**: Reactivity is a key component of a substance's chemical properties, which are characteristics that become evident during a chemical reaction. These properties describe how a substance interacts with other chemicals, leading to the formation of new substances. For instance, the reactivity of oxygen gas (O2) is demonstrated in its reaction with hydrogen gas (H2) to form water (H2O):\n\n   $$\n   2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)\n   $$\n\n3. **Influence on Physical Properties**: The reactivity of a substance can also influence its physical properties. For example, highly reactive functional groups in organic compounds may lead to changes in solubility, boiling points, and melting points due to their tendency to engage in chemical reactions.\n\n4. **Chemical Changes**: Reactivity is often associated with chemical changes, where new substances are formed. Common examples of chemical changes include burning, cooking, rusting, and rotting, all of which result in the creation of new substances.\n\nIn summary, reactivity is a critical indicator of a substance's chemical properties, influencing both its behavior in chemical reactions and its interactions with other materials. Understanding reactivity helps predict how substances will behave under various conditions, which is essential in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and engineering.
