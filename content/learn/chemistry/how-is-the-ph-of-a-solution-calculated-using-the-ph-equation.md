    How is the pH of a solution calculated using the pH equation?
answer: >-
    The pH of a solution is calculated using the pH equation, which is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} = -\log_{10} [H^+]\n$$\n\n### Steps to Calculate pH\n\n1. **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration**: If you know the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (mol/L), you can directly substitute this value into the equation.\n\n2. **Apply the pH Formula**: Use the formula to calculate the pH:\n   - For example, if the hydrogen ion concentration is $ [H^+] = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} $:\n   $$\n   \text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1.0 \times 10^{-3}) = 3\n   $$\n\n### Rearranging the pH Equation\n\nIf you need to find the hydrogen ion concentration from a given pH value, you can rearrange the equation:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if the pH of a solution is 4.5, the hydrogen ion concentration can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n[H^+] = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol/L}\n$$\n\n### Relationship Between pH and pOH\n\nAdditionally, the relationship between pH and pOH can be useful, especially when calculating hydroxide ion concentration $[OH^-]$:\n\n$$\n\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14\n$$\n\nFrom this, you can find pOH if you know the pH:\n\n$$\n\text{pOH} = 14 - \text{pH}\n$$\n\nAnd then calculate the hydroxide ion concentration:\n\n$$\n[OH^-] = 10^{-\text{pOH}}\n$$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nFor a solution with a pH of 11.6, you can find the pOH:\n\n$$\n\text{pOH} = 14 - 11.6 = 2.4\n$$\n\nThen, calculate the hydroxide ion concentration:\n\n$$\n[OH^-] = 10^{-2.4} \approx 0.004 \, \text{mol/L}\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding how to calculate pH and the corresponding hydrogen ion concentration is essential in chemistry, as it helps in determining the acidity or basicity of solutions. The logarithmic nature of the pH scale means that each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration, making these calculations crucial for various applications in science and industry.
