    Who are the awardees of the 2024 Nobel Prize for Chemistry and what are their contributions?
answer: >-
    The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists: David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper. Their groundbreaking work focuses on the structure and design of proteins, which are essential molecules in biological processes.\n\nDavid Baker received half of the prize for his significant contributions to computational protein design. His research has been pivotal in developing methods to design new protein folds from scratch, particularly through his Rosetta program, which began addressing the protein design problem in 2003. This work has enabled scientists to design proteins with atomic accuracy, marking a substantial advancement in the field.\n\nThe other half of the prize was jointly awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for their development of an artificial intelligence model that addresses a long-standing challenge in chemistry: predicting the complex three-dimensional structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Their AI model, AlphaFold2, has revolutionized the way researchers can understand protein structures, which has implications for drug development and other areas of biochemistry.\n\nThe Nobel Committee highlighted that this recognition reflects the incredible advances made in recent years in protein design and structure prediction, which are crucial for various scientific and medical applications.
