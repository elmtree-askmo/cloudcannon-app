    How does the electron configuration of noble gases compare to that of reactive elements?
answer: >-
    The electron configuration of noble gases is fundamentally different from that of reactive elements, primarily due to the stability provided by their full outer electron shells. Noble gases, which are located in group 18 of the periodic table, have complete valence electron configurations, making them chemically inert and unreactive under standard conditions. For instance, the electron configuration of neon (Ne) is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6$, indicating that it has a full outer shell with eight electrons.\n\nIn contrast, reactive elements, such as alkali metals (group 1) and halogens (group 7), have incomplete outer electron shells, which drives their reactivity. Alkali metals possess a single valence electron, making them highly reactive as they tend to lose that electron to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of noble gases. For example, sodium (Na) has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1$, and when it loses its one valence electron, it attains the electron configuration of neon.\n\nHalogens, on the other hand, have seven valence electrons and are highly reactive because they can gain one electron to achieve a full outer shell, resembling the electron configuration of noble gases. For example, chlorine (Cl) has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^5$. When chlorine gains one electron, it achieves the electron configuration of argon, which is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the electron configurations: noble gases have full outer shells, leading to their lack of reactivity, while reactive elements have incomplete outer shells, which makes them eager to lose or gain electrons to achieve stability akin to that of noble gases. This fundamental difference in electron configuration is crucial for understanding the reactivity of various elements in the periodic table.
