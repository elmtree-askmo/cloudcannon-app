    What are the trends in atomic radius across the periodic table?
answer: >-
    The trends in atomic radius across the periodic table are characterized by two main patterns: a decrease in atomic radius from left to right across a period and an increase in atomic radius from top to bottom down a group.\n\n1. **Across a Period**: As you move from left to right across a period, the atomic radius decreases. This trend occurs because, with each successive element, protons are added to the nucleus, increasing the nuclear charge. The increased positive charge attracts the electrons more strongly, pulling them closer to the nucleus and resulting in a smaller atomic radius. For example, the atomic radius of sodium (Na) is larger than that of chlorine (Cl) within the same period.\n\n2. **Down a Group**: Conversely, as you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases. This increase is primarily due to the addition of electron shells. Each new shell is located further from the nucleus, which outweighs the effect of increased nuclear charge. For instance, potassium (K) has a larger atomic radius than hydrogen (H) because potassium has more electron shells.\n\nIn summary, the atomic radius trends can be summarized as follows:\n- **Decreases from left to right across a period** due to increased effective nuclear charge.\n- **Increases from top to bottom down a group** due to the addition of electron shells.\n\nThese trends help explain the arrangement of elements in the periodic table and their chemical properties.
