    What is the typical range of conductivity for ionic solutions?
answer: >-
    The typical range of conductivity for ionic solutions can vary significantly depending on the concentration and type of ions present. For example, typical drinking water has a conductivity range of approximately 200-800 μS/cm, while seawater exhibits much higher conductivity, around 50 mS/cm (or 0.05 S/cm). \n\nIn more controlled settings, ionic conductivity is often recommended to be between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$ S/cm for optimal performance in applications such as separators in electrochemical cells. Additionally, certified standard solutions can have conductivity values ranging from 5 to 200,000 µS/cm, depending on the desired accuracy and specific application.\n\nOverall, the conductivity of ionic solutions is influenced by various factors, including the concentration of ions, the type of ions present, and their mobility. Strong electrolytes, such as NaCl, typically exhibit higher conductivity due to their complete dissociation into ions in solution.
