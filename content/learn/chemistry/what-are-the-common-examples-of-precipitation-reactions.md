    What are the common examples of precipitation reactions?
answer: >-
    Precipitation reactions are chemical processes where two soluble salts react in an aqueous solution to form an insoluble solid, known as a precipitate. These reactions are significant in various fields, including analytical chemistry, where they are used to identify the presence of specific ions in a solution.\n\nHere are some common examples of precipitation reactions:\n\n1. **Formation of Barium Sulfate**:\n   When barium chloride ($BaCl_2$) reacts with sodium sulfate ($Na_2SO_4$), barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$) precipitates out of the solution:\n   $$\n   BaCl_2(aq) + Na_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow BaSO_4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)\n   $$\n\n2. **Formation of Silver Chloride**:\n   Mixing silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$) with sodium chloride ($NaCl$) results in the formation of silver chloride ($AgCl$), which is a white precipitate:\n   $$\n   AgNO_3(aq) + NaCl(aq) \rightarrow AgCl(s) + NaNO_3(aq)\n   $$\n\n3. **Formation of Calcium Phosphate**:\n   When calcium chloride ($CaCl_2$) reacts with sodium phosphate ($Na_3PO_4$), calcium phosphate ($Ca_3(PO_4)_2$) precipitates:\n   $$\n   3CaCl_2(aq) + 2Na_3PO_4(aq) \rightarrow Ca_3(PO_4)_2(s) + 6NaCl(aq)\n   $$\n\n4. **Formation of Lead(II) Iodide**:\n   The reaction between lead(II) nitrate ($Pb(NO_3)_2$) and potassium iodide ($KI$) produces lead(II) iodide ($PbI_2$), which is a bright yellow precipitate:\n   $$\n   Pb(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2KI(aq) \rightarrow PbI_2(s) + 2KNO_3(aq)\n   $$\n\n5. **Formation of Copper(II) Hydroxide**:\n   When copper(II) sulfate ($CuSO_4$) reacts with sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$), copper(II) hydroxide ($Cu(OH)_2$) precipitates:\n   $$\n   CuSO_4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) \rightarrow Cu(OH)_2(s) + Na_2SO_4(aq)\n   $$\n\nThese examples illustrate how precipitation reactions can be utilized to form various insoluble compounds, which can be useful in both laboratory and industrial applications.
