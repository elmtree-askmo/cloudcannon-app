    How does the percentage of chlorine isotopes in nature contribute to its atomic weight?
answer: >-
    The percentage of chlorine isotopes in nature significantly contributes to its atomic weight through the process of calculating a weighted average based on their relative abundances. Chlorine has two stable isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. The atomic weight of chlorine is determined by the natural abundance of these isotopes, which are approximately 75% for chlorine-35 and 25% for chlorine-37.\n\n### Calculation of Atomic Weight\n\nTo calculate the atomic weight of chlorine, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Isotopes and Their Masses**:\n   - Chlorine-35: Atomic mass = 35 AMU\n   - Chlorine-37: Atomic mass = 37 AMU\n\n2. **Determine the Abundance**:\n   - Chlorine-35: Abundance = 75%\n   - Chlorine-37: Abundance = 25%\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**:\n   The formula for calculating atomic weight is:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{(\text{mass of isotope 1} \times \text{abundance of isotope 1}) + (\text{mass of isotope 2} \times \text{abundance of isotope 2})}{100}\n   $$\n\n   Plugging in the values for chlorine:\n\n   - Contribution from chlorine-35:\n     $$ \n     35 \, \text{AMU} \times 75 = 2625 \n     $$\n   - Contribution from chlorine-37:\n     $$ \n     37 \, \text{AMU} \times 25 = 925 \n     $$\n\n4. **Add the Contributions**:\n   $$\n   2625 + 925 = 3550 \n   $$\n\n5. **Divide by 100 to Find the Atomic Weight**:\n   $$\n   \text{Atomic Weight} = \frac{3550}{100} = 35.5 \, \text{AMU}\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the atomic weight of chlorine is approximately 35.5 AMU, which reflects the weighted contributions of its isotopes based on their natural abundances. This calculation illustrates how the atomic weight is influenced more by the more abundant isotope, chlorine-35, than by chlorine-37. Understanding this process is essential in chemistry, as it affects various applications, including chemical reactions, molecular formulas, and isotope studies.
