    How are pure substances classified in terms of elements and compounds?
answer: >-
    Pure substances are classified into two main categories: elements and compounds. \n\n1. **Elements**: An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Elements are the fundamental building blocks of matter and are represented by chemical symbols. For example, copper (Cu) and oxygen (O) are both elements. Each element consists of only one type of atom.\n\n2. **Compounds**: A compound is a pure substance formed when two or more different elements are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. The properties of a compound are distinct from those of the individual elements that compose it. For instance, water (H₂O) is a compound made from hydrogen and oxygen, and it exhibits properties that are different from those of hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂) gases. Compounds can be represented by chemical formulas, which indicate the types and numbers of atoms present in the molecule. For example, glucose is represented as C₆H₁₂O₆, indicating it contains six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.\n\nIn summary, pure substances are classified into elements, which consist of a single type of atom, and compounds, which are made up of two or more different elements chemically combined.
