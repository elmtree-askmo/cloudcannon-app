    Give an example of a heterogeneous mixture and describe its characteristics.
answer: >-
    An example of a heterogeneous mixture is a salad. \n\n### Characteristics of a Heterogeneous Mixture (Salad):\n\n1. **Visibly Different Components**: In a salad, the individual ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots can be seen distinctly. Each component retains its own properties and appearance.\n\n2. **Separation by Physical Means**: The components of a salad can be easily separated by physical means. For instance, one can pick out the tomatoes or cucumbers without affecting the other ingredients.\n\n3. **Non-uniform Composition**: Unlike homogeneous mixtures, where the composition is uniform throughout, a salad has a non-uniform composition. Different parts of the salad may contain different proportions of the ingredients.\n\n4. **Phases**: A salad consists of different phases (solid pieces of vegetables) that do not blend into a single phase, which is a hallmark of heterogeneous mixtures.\n\n5. **Examples of Other Heterogeneous Mixtures**: Other examples include oil and water, where the two liquids do not mix and form distinct layers, and a mixture of sand and iron filings, where the two substances can be easily distinguished and separated.\n\nIn summary, heterogeneous mixtures like salad are characterized by their visibly different components, ease of separation, non-uniform composition, and the presence of distinct phases.
