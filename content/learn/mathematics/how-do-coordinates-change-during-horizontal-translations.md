    How do coordinates change during horizontal translations?
answer: >-
    During horizontal translations, the coordinates of points on a graph change based on the addition or subtraction of a constant value to the $x$-coordinate. This transformation is a type of rigid transformation, meaning that the shape and size of the graph remain unchanged; only its position in the coordinate plane is altered.\n\n### How Coordinates Change\n\n1. **Left Translation**: If a function \(f(x)\) is translated to the left by $c$ units, the new function can be expressed as:\n   $$ y = f(x + c) $$\n   In this case, every point \((x, y)\) on the original graph will move to the new point \((x - c, y)\). For example, if $c = 3$, the point \((2, f(2))\) will move to \((-1, f(2))\).\n\n2. **Right Translation**: Conversely, if the function is translated to the right by $c$ units, the new function is:\n   $$ y = f(x - c) $$\n   Here, every point \((x, y)\) on the original graph will move to the new point \((x + c, y)\). For instance, if $c = 3$, the point \((2, f(2))\) will move to \((5, f(2))\).\n\n### Example Functions\n\nConsider the functions:\n- \(g(x) = (x + 3)^2\) (shifts left by 3 units)\n- \(h(x) = (x - 3)^2\) (shifts right by 3 units)\n\nFor the function \(g(x)\):\n- The point \((0, g(0)) = (0, 9)\) (since \(g(0) = 3^2 = 9\)) translates to \((-3, 9)\).\n\nFor the function \(h(x)\):\n- The point \((0, h(0)) = (0, 9)\) (since \(h(0) = (-3)^2 = 9\)) translates to \((3, 9)\).\n\n### Summary of Translation Rules\n\n- **Left Shift**: \(y = f(x + c)\) → Moves left $c$ units.\n- **Right Shift**: \(y = f(x - c)\) → Moves right $c$ units.\n\nIn conclusion, during horizontal translations, the $x$-coordinates of points on the graph are adjusted by adding or subtracting a constant, resulting in a shift of the entire graph left or right without altering its shape.
