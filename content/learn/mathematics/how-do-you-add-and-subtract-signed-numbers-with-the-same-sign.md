answer: >-
    To add and subtract signed numbers with the same sign, you can follow these straightforward rules:\n\n### Adding Signed Numbers with the Same Sign\n1. **Add the Absolute Values**: When you have two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative), you first add their absolute values.\n2. **Keep the Common Sign**: The result will have the same sign as the numbers you are adding.\n\n**Examples**:\n- For positive numbers: \n  - \( (+3) + (+5) = +8 \)\n- For negative numbers: \n  - \( (-3) + (-5) = -8 \)\n\n### Subtracting Signed Numbers with the Same Sign\nWhen subtracting signed numbers, if both numbers have the same sign, you can follow these steps:\n1. **Change the Subtraction to Addition**: Convert the subtraction into an addition problem by changing the sign of the number being subtracted.\n2. **Follow the Addition Rules**: After changing the sign, apply the rules for adding signed numbers.\n\n**Example**:\n- For two negative numbers:\n  - $ -10 - 5 $ becomes \( -10 + (-5) = -15 \)\n\nIn summary, when adding or subtracting signed numbers with the same sign, you simply add their absolute values and keep the common sign for addition, or convert the subtraction to addition and apply the same rules.
