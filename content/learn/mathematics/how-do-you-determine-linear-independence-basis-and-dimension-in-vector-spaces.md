    To determine linear independence, basis, and dimension in vector spaces, we can follow these key concepts:\n\n### Linear Independence\nA set of vectors is said to be **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. In mathematical terms, a set of vectors $ \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\} $ is linearly independent if the equation \n\n$$\na_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \ldots + a_k v_k = 0\n$$ \n\nonly has the trivial solution $ a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_k = 0 $. If there exists a nontrivial solution (where at least one $ a_i \neq 0 $), the vectors are linearly dependent.\n\n### Basis\nA **basis** of a vector space $ V $ is a set of vectors that is both linearly independent and spans the entire space. This means that any vector in $ V $ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. For example, in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, the vectors \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \) form a basis because they are linearly independent and can be used to express any vector in the plane.\n\n### Dimension\nThe **dimension** of a vector space is defined as the number of vectors in any basis for that space. It represents the minimum number of independent directions needed to describe any vector in the space. For instance, the dimension of $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ is 2, as it requires two basis vectors to span the space. Similarly, the dimension of $ \mathbb{R}^3 $ is 3.\n\n### Determining Linear Independence, Basis, and Dimension\n1. **Linear Independence**: To check if a set of vectors is linearly independent, you can form a matrix with these vectors as columns and perform row reduction to echelon form. If the number of pivot columns equals the number of vectors, they are linearly independent.\n\n2. **Basis**: If a set of vectors is linearly independent and spans the vector space, it forms a basis. You can also use the determinant of a square matrix formed by the vectors: if the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent and thus form a basis.\n\n3. **Dimension**: The dimension can be found by counting the number of vectors in a basis. If you have a finite basis, all bases of the vector space will have the same number of elements, which defines the dimension of the space.\n\nIn summary, to determine linear independence, basis, and dimension, you can utilize row reduction techniques, the properties of determinants, and the definitions of spanning sets and linear combinations.
