    Can you explain the difference between row-echelon form and reduced row-echelon form?
answer: >-
    The difference between row-echelon form (REF) and reduced row-echelon form (RREF) is primarily based on the specific conditions that each form must satisfy.\n\n### Row-Echelon Form (REF)\nA matrix is in row-echelon form if it meets the following criteria:\n1. **Leading Entry**: The leading nonzero entry of each row (also known as the pivot) is 1.\n2. **Staircase Pattern**: The leading 1 of a row is strictly to the right of the leading 1 of the row above it.\n3. **Zero Rows**: Any all-zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix.\n\nAn example of a matrix in row-echelon form is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\n0 & 1 & 4 \\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Reduced Row-Echelon Form (RREF)\nA matrix is in reduced row-echelon form if it satisfies all the conditions of row-echelon form, plus the following additional conditions:\n1. **Leading 1s**: The leading entry in each row is 1.\n2. **Cleared Columns**: The column of any leading 1 is cleared, meaning all other entries in that column are 0.\n\nAn example of a matrix in reduced row-echelon form is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while both forms require leading entries to be 1 and arranged in a staircase pattern, RREF goes a step further by ensuring that each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column. This makes RREF a more refined and unique representation of a matrix, which is particularly useful in solving systems of linear equations.
