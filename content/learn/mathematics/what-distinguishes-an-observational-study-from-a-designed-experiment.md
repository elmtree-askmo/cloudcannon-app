    What distinguishes an observational study from a designed experiment?
answer: >-
    The distinction between an observational study and a designed experiment lies primarily in the level of control the researcher has over the variables being studied.\n\n1. **Observational Study**: In this type of study, researchers observe individuals and measure variables of interest without attempting to influence or manipulate the responses. The goal is to gather data as it naturally occurs, allowing researchers to identify correlations and patterns without inferring causation. For example, a researcher might observe the dietary habits of a group of people and their corresponding health outcomes without intervening in their eating behaviors.\n\n2. **Designed Experiment**: In contrast, a designed experiment involves the deliberate imposition of treatments or interventions on individuals to observe their effects. This method allows researchers to establish cause-and-effect relationships by controlling for confounding variables. For instance, a researcher might assign participants to different diet plans (treatments) and measure their health outcomes to determine which diet is most effective.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that observational studies do not manipulate variables, while designed experiments actively impose treatments to observe their effects. This fundamental distinction affects the conclusions that can be drawn from each type of study, particularly regarding causation.
