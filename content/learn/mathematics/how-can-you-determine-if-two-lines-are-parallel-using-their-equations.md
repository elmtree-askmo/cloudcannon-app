    How can you determine if two lines are parallel using their equations?
answer: >-
    To determine if two lines are parallel using their equations, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Form of the Equations**: Ensure that the equations of the lines are in slope-intercept form, which is given by:\n   $$ y = mx + b $$\n   where $ m $ is the slope (gradient) of the line and $ b $ is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Extract the Slopes**: From the equations, identify the slopes $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ of the two lines. For example, if you have the equations:\n   - Line 1: $ y = 6x - 4 $ (slope $ m_1 = 6 $)\n   - Line 2: $ y = 3x + 2 $ (slope $ m_2 = 3 $)\n\n3. **Compare the Slopes**: The lines are parallel if their slopes are equal:\n   $$ m_1 = m_2 $$\n\n4. **Example**: Consider the lines given by the equations $ 6x - 4y = 12 $ and $ 3x - 2y = 5 $. To check if they are parallel:\n   - Convert both equations to slope-intercept form:\n     - For $ 6x - 4y = 12 $:\n       $$ -4y = -6x + 12 $$\n       $$ y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3 $$\n       (Slope $ m_1 = \frac{3}{2} $)\n     - For $ 3x - 2y = 5 $:\n       $$ -2y = -3x + 5 $$\n       $$ y = \frac{3}{2}x - \frac{5}{2} $$\n       (Slope $ m_2 = \frac{3}{2} $)\n\n   Since $ m_1 = m_2 = \frac{3}{2} $, the two lines are parallel.\n\nIn summary, two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. If you can express both lines in the form $ y = mx + b $ and find that their slopes $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are equal, then the lines do not intersect and are parallel.
