    How do reflections across axes transform cube root functions?
answer: >-
    Reflections across axes are important transformations that can significantly alter the appearance of cube root functions. Hereâ€™s how these reflections work:\n\n1. **Reflection Across the X-Axis**: \n   - To reflect a cube root function across the x-axis, you replace the function \( f(x) \) with \( -f(x) \). For the parent cube root function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \), reflecting it across the x-axis results in the function \( g(x) = -\sqrt[3]{x} \). This transformation flips the graph upside down, meaning that all positive outputs become negative and vice versa. The key feature of this transformation is that it retains the same x-values but changes the sign of the y-values.\n\n2. **Reflection Across the Y-Axis**: \n   - To reflect a cube root function across the y-axis, you replace $ x $ with $ -x $ in the function. For example, reflecting the parent function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) across the y-axis gives you \( g(x) = \sqrt[3]{-x} \). This transformation flips the graph horizontally, meaning that the left side of the graph becomes the right side and vice versa. The y-values remain unchanged for corresponding x-values, but the x-values are negated.\n\n3. **Characteristics of Reflected Functions**:\n   - Both transformations maintain the overall shape of the cube root function, which is characterized by its continuous and increasing nature. However, the reflections change the direction of the graph:\n     - The reflection across the x-axis results in a graph that decreases from left to right, while the reflection across the y-axis retains the increasing nature but inverts the x-direction.\n\n4. **Odd Function Property**: \n   - Cube root functions are odd functions, meaning that \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). This property implies that reflecting a cube root function across the y-axis will yield a graph that is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, reflecting across the x-axis and y-axis can be seen as two transformations that maintain the odd function property.\n\nIn summary, reflecting cube root functions across the x-axis and y-axis involves changing the signs of the function outputs and inputs, respectively. These transformations alter the orientation of the graph while preserving its fundamental characteristics.
