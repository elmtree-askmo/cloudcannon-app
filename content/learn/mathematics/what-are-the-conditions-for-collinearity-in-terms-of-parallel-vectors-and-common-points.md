    What are the conditions for collinearity in terms of parallel vectors and common points?
answer: >-
    The conditions for collinearity in terms of parallel vectors and common points can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Collinear Points**: Three or more points $ A, B, $ and $ C $ are collinear if the vectors connecting them are scalar multiples of each other. Specifically, the vectors $ \vec{AB} $ and $ \vec{AC} $ are collinear if there exists a scalar $ k $ such that:\n   $$\n   \vec{AC} = k \cdot \vec{AB}\n   $$\n   This means that the points $ A, B, $ and $ C $ lie on the same straight line in a coordinate system.\n\n2. **Parallel Vectors**: Two vectors $ \vec{u} $ and $ \vec{v} $ are parallel if they have the same direction or are scalar multiples of each other. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$\n   \vec{u} = k \cdot \vec{v}\n   $$\n   for some scalar $ k $. If two vectors are parallel and share a common point, then the points they connect are collinear.\n\n3. **Common Points**: If two vectors are parallel and originate from a common point, the endpoints of these vectors will also be collinear. For example, if $ \vec{AB} $ and $ \vec{AC} $ are parallel and share the common point $ A $, then points $ A, B, $ and $ C $ are collinear.\n\nIn summary, the conditions for collinearity can be established through the relationships between the vectors connecting the points, their parallelism, and the presence of common points. If the vectors are scalar multiples of each other and share a common point, the points are collinear.
