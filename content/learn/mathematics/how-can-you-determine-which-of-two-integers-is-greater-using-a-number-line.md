    How can you determine which of two integers is greater using a number line?
answer: >-
    To determine which of two integers is greater using a number line, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Plot the Integers**: Begin by plotting both integers on a number line. The number line is a straight line where each point corresponds to a real number. Typically, the left side of the number line represents negative values, while the right side represents positive values.\n\n2. **Identify Their Positions**: Once the integers are plotted, observe their positions relative to each other. The integer that is located further to the right on the number line is the greater integer. Conversely, the integer that is further to the left is the smaller integer.\n\n3. **Use Mathematical Symbols**: You can express the relationship between the two integers using mathematical symbols. If integer A is to the left of integer B, you can write $ A < B $. If integer A is to the right of integer B, you can write $ A > B $. If both integers are at the same position, you can write $ A = B $.\n\n### Example\nLet's compare the integers -4 and 3:\n\n- Plot -4 and 3 on the number line.\n- -4 is located to the left of 3.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that $ -4 < 3 $.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, by plotting integers on a number line, you can easily determine which integer is greater based on their relative positions. The integer on the right is larger than the integer on the left, and you can use the symbols $ > $, $ < $, or $ = $ to express their relationship.
