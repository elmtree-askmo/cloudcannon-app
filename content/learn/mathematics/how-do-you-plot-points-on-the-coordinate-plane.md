    How do you plot points on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To plot points on the coordinate plane, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Coordinate Plane**: The coordinate plane consists of two perpendicular lines: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. The point where they intersect is called the origin, denoted as (0, 0).\n\n2. **Identify the Coordinates**: Each point on the coordinate plane is represented by an ordered pair (x, y), where:\n   - The first number (x) indicates the horizontal position (left or right from the origin).\n   - The second number (y) indicates the vertical position (up or down from the origin).\n\n3. **Plotting Steps**:\n   - **Start at the Origin**: Begin at the point (0, 0).\n   - **Move Along the X-Axis**: Use the x-coordinate to determine your horizontal movement:\n     - If the x-coordinate is positive, move to the right.\n     - If the x-coordinate is negative, move to the left.\n   - **Move Along the Y-Axis**: Use the y-coordinate to determine your vertical movement:\n     - If the y-coordinate is positive, move up.\n     - If the y-coordinate is negative, move down.\n   - **Mark the Point**: After moving according to both coordinates, draw a point at the final location and label it.\n\n### Example: Plotting the Point (3, -2)\n1. **Start at the Origin**: Begin at (0, 0).\n2. **Move Along the X-Axis**: Move 3 units to the right to reach (3, 0).\n3. **Move Along the Y-Axis**: From (3, 0), move 2 units down to reach (3, -2).\n4. **Mark the Point**: Draw a point at (3, -2) and label it.\n\n### Example: Plotting Multiple Points\nTo plot points A (4, 3), B (-3, 0), and C (3, -2):\n- **Point A (4, 3)**:\n  - Start at (0, 0), move right 4 units to (4, 0), then up 3 units to (4, 3). Mark and label A.\n  \n- **Point B (-3, 0)**:\n  - Start at (0, 0), move left 3 units to (-3, 0). Mark and label B.\n  \n- **Point C (3, -2)**:\n  - Start at (0, 0), move right 3 units to (3, 0), then down 2 units to (3, -2). Mark and label C.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately plot any point on the coordinate plane.
