    What is the process for ordering integers in ascending order?
answer: >-
    To order integers in ascending order, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Integers**: Start with the list of integers you want to order. For example, let's take the integers –5, 3, 4, and –2.\n\n2. **Plot on a Number Line**: Visualize or draw a number line. Place the integers on the number line according to their value. Remember that numbers to the left are smaller, and numbers to the right are larger. For our example:\n   - –5 is the farthest left,\n   - –2 is to the right of –5,\n   - 3 is to the right of –2,\n   - 4 is the farthest right.\n\n3. **Order from Left to Right**: Write the integers from left to right based on their positions on the number line. This gives you the order of the integers in increasing order.\n\n4. **Result**: For the integers –5, 3, 4, and –2, the ascending order is:\n   - –5, –2, 3, 4.\n\n5. **Practice with More Integers**: You can apply the same method to any set of integers. For example, to arrange –15, 18, –12, 8, and –9 in ascending order, you would plot them on the number line and find that the order is:\n   - –15, –12, –9, 8, 18.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively order any set of integers in ascending order.
