    Factoring a polynomial by grouping is a useful technique, especially for polynomials with four terms. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n### Steps to Factor a Polynomial by Grouping\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomial**: Start with a polynomial that has four terms. For example, consider the polynomial $ ax + ay + bx + by $.\n\n2. **Group the Terms**: Divide the polynomial into two groups. For the example above, you can group the first two terms together and the last two terms together:\n   $$\n   (ax + ay) + (bx + by)\n   $$\n\n3. **Factor Out the Common Factors**: Look for common factors in each group and factor them out:\n   - From the first group $ ax + ay $, you can factor out $ a $:\n     $$\n     a(x + y)\n     $$\n   - From the second group $ bx + by $, you can factor out $ b $:\n     $$\n     b(x + y)\n     $$\n\n4. **Combine the Factored Groups**: Now, you can combine the factored groups:\n   $$\n   a(x + y) + b(x + y)\n   $$\n\n5. **Factor Out the Common Binomial**: Notice that \( (x + y) \) is a common factor in both terms. Factor it out:\n   $$\n   (x + y)(a + b)\n   $$\n\n6. **Final Result**: The polynomial $ ax + ay + bx + by $ is now factored as:\n   $$\n   (x + y)(a + b)\n   $$\n\n### Example\n\nLet’s take a specific example to illustrate this process:\n\n**Example Polynomial**: $ 2x^2 + 4x + 3x + 6 $\n\n1. **Group the Terms**:\n   $$\n   (2x^2 + 4x) + (3x + 6)\n   $$\n\n2. **Factor Out the Common Factors**:\n   - From $ 2x^2 + 4x $, factor out $ 2x $:\n     $$\n     2x(x + 2)\n     $$\n   - From $ 3x + 6 $, factor out $ 3 $:\n     $$\n     3(x + 2)\n     $$\n\n3. **Combine the Factored Groups**:\n   $$\n   2x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)\n   $$\n\n4. **Factor Out the Common Binomial**:\n   $$\n   (x + 2)(2x + 3)\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe polynomial $ 2x^2 + 4x + 3x + 6 $ is factored as \( (x + 2)(2x + 3) \).\n\nThis method is particularly effective for polynomials with four terms, allowing you to systematically group and factor them. If you encounter polynomials with different numbers of terms, other factoring techniques may be more appropriate.
