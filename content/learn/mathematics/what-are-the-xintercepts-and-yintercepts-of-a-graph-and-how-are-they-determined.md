    What are the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a graph, and how are they determined?
answer: >-
    The x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a graph are crucial points that help in understanding the behavior of the graph of a function.\n\n### X-Intercepts\nThe x-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph intersects the x-axis. At this point, the value of $ y $ is zero. To find the x-intercept of a function, you set $ y = 0 $ and solve for $ x $.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $:\n1. Set $ y = 0 $:\n   $$\n   0 = 2x + 1\n   $$\n2. Solve for $ x $:\n   $$\n   2x = -1 \\\n   x = -\frac{1}{2}\n   $$\nThus, the x-intercept is \((-0.5, 0)\).\n\n### Y-Intercepts\nThe y-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. At this point, the value of $ x $ is zero. To find the y-intercept of a function, you substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation and solve for $ y $.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the same equation $ y = 2x + 1 $:\n1. Set $ x = 0 $:\n   $$\n   y = 2(0) + 1 = 1\n   $$\nThus, the y-intercept is \((0, 1)\).\n\n### Summary\n- **X-Intercept**: Found by setting $ y = 0 $ and solving for $ x $.\n- **Y-Intercept**: Found by setting $ x = 0 $ and solving for $ y $.\n\nThese intercepts are essential for graphing linear equations and understanding their properties, such as slope and direction.
