    What is the initial approximation of a square wave using its fundamental frequency?
answer: >-
    The initial approximation of a square wave using its fundamental frequency can be represented by the first term of its Fourier series expansion. For a square wave with a period $ T $ and a fundamental frequency $ f = \frac{1}{T} $, the Fourier series representation includes only the odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency.\n\nThe Fourier series for a square wave can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nx(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2\pi(2k-1)ft)}{2k-1}\n$$\n\nFor the initial approximation, we consider only the fundamental frequency (the first harmonic), which is given by:\n\n$$\nx(t) \approx \frac{4}{\pi} \sin(2\pi ft)\n$$\n\nIn this case, if the fundamental frequency $ f $ is 50 Hz, the initial approximation of the square wave would be:\n\n$$\nx(t) \approx \frac{4}{\pi} \sin(100\pi t)\n$$\n\nThis sine wave represents the fundamental frequency of the square wave, and it serves as the starting point for further approximations that include higher odd harmonics to better approximate the square wave shape. As more harmonics are added, the approximation becomes closer to the actual square wave, which has sharp transitions between its high and low states.
