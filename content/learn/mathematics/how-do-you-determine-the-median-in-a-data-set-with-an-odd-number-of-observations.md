    How do you determine the median in a data set with an odd number of observations?
answer: >-
    To determine the median in a dataset with an odd number of observations, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Arrange the Data**: First, sort the dataset in ascending order. This step is crucial as the median is defined based on the position of the values in the ordered list.\n\n2. **Calculate the Position**: If the number of observations, denoted as $n$, is odd, the median is located at the position given by the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Median} = x_{(n+1)/2}\n   $$\n   Here, $x_{(n+1)/2}$ represents the value at the middle position of the ordered dataset.\n\n3. **Identify the Median**: Once you have calculated the position, simply find the value at that position in the sorted list. This value is the median.\n\n### Example\nConsider the dataset: {3, 1, 7, 5, 9}. \n\n1. **Sort the Data**: The sorted dataset is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n2. **Count the Observations**: Here, $n = 5$, which is odd.\n3. **Calculate the Position**: \n   $$\n   \text{Median} = x_{(5+1)/2} = x_{3}\n   $$\n4. **Identify the Median**: The value at the 3rd position in the sorted list is 5. Therefore, the median of this dataset is 5.\n\nThis method ensures that you accurately find the median for any dataset with an odd number of observations.
