    Name three types of non-linear functions.
answer: >-
    Three types of non-linear functions include:\n\n1. **Quadratic Functions**: These functions are represented by equations of the form \(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\), where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, which can open upwards or downwards depending on the sign of $a$.\n\n2. **Exponential Functions**: These functions are expressed in the form \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\), where $a$ is a constant, $b$ is a positive real number, and $b \neq 1$. The graph of an exponential function shows rapid growth or decay, depending on whether $b$ is greater than or less than 1.\n\n3. **Piecewise Functions**: These functions are defined by different expressions based on the input value. For example, a piecewise function might be defined as:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   x^2 & \text{if } x < 0 \\\n   2x + 1 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   The graph of a piecewise function can consist of multiple segments, each representing a different rule for different intervals of the domain.\n\nThese non-linear functions exhibit varying rates of change and slopes across their domains, distinguishing them from linear functions, which have a constant rate of change.
