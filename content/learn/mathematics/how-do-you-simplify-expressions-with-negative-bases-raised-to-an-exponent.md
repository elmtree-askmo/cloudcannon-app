    How do you simplify expressions with negative bases raised to an exponent?
answer: >-
    To simplify expressions with negative bases raised to an exponent, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Negative Base**: Recognize the expression that contains a negative base, such as $(-a)^{n}$, where $a$ is a positive number and $n$ is the exponent.\n\n2. **Determine the Exponent's Parity**:\n   - If the exponent $n$ is **even**, the result will be positive:\n     $$\n     (-a)^{2} = a^{2}\n     $$\n   - If the exponent $n$ is **odd**, the result will be negative:\n     $$\n     (-a)^{3} = -a^{3}\n     $$\n\n3. **Apply the Reciprocal Rule for Negative Exponents**: If the expression includes a negative exponent, you can convert it using the reciprocal rule:\n   $$\n   (-a)^{-n} = \frac{1}{(-a)^{n}}\n   $$\n   Here, you would first evaluate $(-a)^{n}$ based on whether $n$ is even or odd, as described above.\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: After applying the reciprocal rule, simplify the expression further if possible. For example, consider the expression $(-2)^{-3}$:\n   - First, apply the reciprocal rule:\n     $$\n     (-2)^{-3} = \frac{1}{(-2)^{3}} = \frac{1}{-8} = -\frac{1}{8}\n     $$\n\n5. **Generalization**: This method can be applied to any negative base and any exponent, ensuring that you account for the sign based on the parity of the exponent.\n\n### Example\nLet's simplify the expression $(-3)^{4}$ and $(-3)^{-2}$:\n- For $(-3)^{4}$ (even exponent):\n  $$\n  (-3)^{4} = 3^{4} = 81\n  $$\n- For $(-3)^{-2}$ (negative exponent):\n  $$\n  (-3)^{-2} = \frac{1}{(-3)^{2}} = \frac{1}{9}\n  $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively simplify expressions involving negative bases raised to exponents, ensuring clarity and accuracy in your calculations.
