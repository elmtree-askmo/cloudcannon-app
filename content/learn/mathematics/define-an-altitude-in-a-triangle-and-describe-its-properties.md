    Define an altitude in a triangle and describe its properties.
answer: >-
    An altitude in a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex perpendicular to the line containing the opposite side. This segment represents the shortest distance from the vertex to the opposite side, effectively creating a right angle with that side. The properties of an altitude include:\n\n1. **Perpendicularity**: The altitude is always perpendicular to the side it intersects, forming a right angle (90 degrees) with that side.\n\n2. **Vertex to Opposite Side**: Each triangle has three altitudes, one from each vertex to the opposite side. The point where all three altitudes intersect is known as the orthocenter of the triangle.\n\n3. **Length Variation**: The length of the altitude can vary depending on the type of triangle. For example, in a right triangle, one of the altitudes is equal to the length of one of the legs, while in an obtuse triangle, the altitude may fall outside the triangle.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the altitude. The formula for the area $A$ of a triangle is given by:\n   $$\n   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\n   $$\n   Here, the height refers to the length of the altitude.\n\n5. **Special Right Triangles**: In special right triangles, such as the 45°-45°-90° triangle, the altitude can be easily calculated based on the lengths of the sides. For instance, in a 45°-45°-90° triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse can be derived using the properties of the triangle.\n\nIn summary, the altitude is a crucial concept in triangle geometry, serving both as a measure of height and as a tool for calculating area, while also playing a significant role in the properties and characteristics of triangles.
