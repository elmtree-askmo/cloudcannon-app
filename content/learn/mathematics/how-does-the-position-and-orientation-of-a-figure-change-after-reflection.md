    How does the position and orientation of a figure change after reflection?
answer: >-
    The position and orientation of a figure change in specific ways after a reflection transformation. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of these changes:\n\n### Position Change\nWhen a figure is reflected across a line (the line of reflection), each point of the figure is mapped to a new position that is equidistant from the line of reflection but on the opposite side. For example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). This means that the figure's overall position in the coordinate plane shifts, but the distance between points remains unchanged.\n\n### Orientation Change\nWhile the size and shape of the figure remain the same (as reflection is an isometric transformation), the orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted. This means that the figure appears flipped. For instance, if you have a letter "P" and reflect it over the y-axis, it will appear as a "q". \n\n### Key Properties of Reflection\n1. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape.\n2. **Lateral Inversion**: The orientation is reversed. For example, if a figure faces right before reflection, it will face left after reflection.\n3. **Distance Preservation**: The distance between any two points in the original figure is the same as the distance between their corresponding points in the reflected image.\n\n### Example\nConsider a triangle with vertices at \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), and \(C(5, 2)\). If we reflect this triangle over the y-axis:\n- The new coordinates will be:\n  - \(A'(-1, 2)\)\n  - \(B'(-3, 4)\)\n  - \(C'(-5, 2)\)\n\nThe triangle will maintain its shape and size, but its orientation will be flipped horizontally.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, after a reflection, the position of a figure changes as each point is moved to a new location on the opposite side of the line of reflection, while the orientation is inverted. The properties of congruence and distance preservation ensure that the reflected image is a true mirror image of the original figure.
