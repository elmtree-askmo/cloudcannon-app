    What is a diagonalizable matrix?
answer: >-
    A diagonalizable matrix is a square matrix that can be expressed in the form $A = PDP^{-1}$, where $A$ is the original matrix, $D$ is a diagonal matrix, and $P$ is an invertible (nonsingular) matrix. The diagonal matrix $D$ contains the eigenvalues of $A$ along its diagonal, while the columns of the matrix $P$ consist of the corresponding eigenvectors of $A$.\n\nIn more formal terms, an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that:\n\n$$\nP^{-1}AP = D\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ is a diagonal matrix. The fundamental property of diagonalizable matrices is that they have linearly independent eigenvectors. This means that the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces associated with each eigenvalue must equal $n$, the size of the matrix. If such a basis of eigenvectors exists, it allows for the transformation of the matrix into a simpler diagonal form, which can greatly facilitate computations, such as finding matrix powers or solving systems of linear equations.\n\nAdditionally, a matrix is not diagonalizable if the algebraic multiplicity of any eigenvalue does not equal its geometric multiplicity. In practical applications, diagonalization is particularly useful in various fields, including systems of differential equations and linear transformations.\n\nIn summary, a diagonalizable matrix is one that can be transformed into a diagonal matrix through a similarity transformation, which preserves its essential properties and simplifies many mathematical operations.
