    How is the area of a triangle calculated using its vertices' coordinates?
answer: >-
    To calculate the area of a triangle using the coordinates of its vertices in the Cartesian coordinate system, you can use the following formula. If the vertices of the triangle are given as \( A(x_1, y_1) \), \( B(x_2, y_2) \), and \( C(x_3, y_3) \), the area $ A $ of the triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nA = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|\n$$\n\nThis formula effectively computes the area by taking the absolute value of a determinant that represents the vertices' coordinates. The factor of $ \frac{1}{2} $ accounts for the fact that the determinant gives twice the area of the triangle.\n\nThis method is particularly useful because it allows for the calculation of the area without needing to know the lengths of the sides or the angles of the triangle, making it applicable to any triangle defined by its vertex coordinates.
