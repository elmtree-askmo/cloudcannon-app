    How are triangles affected by reflections?

    Reflections have a significant impact on triangles, as they transform the original triangle into a mirror image across a specified line of reflection. Here are the key aspects of how triangles are affected by reflections:\n\n1. **Definition of Reflection**: A reflection is a transformation that flips a geometric figure over a line, known as the line of reflection. Each point of the original triangle (pre-image) is mapped to a corresponding point (image) such that the distance from the point to the line of reflection is preserved.\n\n2. **Properties of Reflections**:\n   - **Congruence**: The reflected triangle is congruent to the original triangle. This means that all corresponding sides and angles are equal in measure.\n   - **Distance Preservation**: The distance between any two points in the original triangle remains the same in the reflected triangle. For example, if triangle ABC is reflected over a line, the distance between points A and B will be equal to the distance between points A' and B', where A' and B' are the images of A and B after reflection.\n   - **Angle Measures**: The measures of angles in the triangle are preserved during reflection. If triangle ABC has angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C, then triangle A'B'C' (the reflected triangle) will also have angles ∠A', ∠B', and ∠C' that are equal to ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C respectively.\n   - **Orientation Change**: Reflecting a triangle changes its orientation. For instance, if the original triangle is oriented in a clockwise direction, the reflected triangle will be oriented counterclockwise.\n\n3. **Reflecting Points**: To reflect a triangle, you can reflect each vertex of the triangle over the line of reflection. For example, if triangle ABC has vertices A(1, 4), B(1, 1), and C(5, 1), and you reflect it over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be A'(-1, 4), B'(-1, 1), and C'(-5, 1).\n\n4. **Distance from the Line of Reflection**: Each point and its image must be equidistant from the line of reflection. This means that if a point is located at a certain distance from the line, its reflected image will be located at the same distance on the opposite side of the line.\n\n5. **Examples of Reflection**: \n   - Reflecting triangle ABC over the x-axis results in triangle A'B'C' where the y-coordinates of the vertices are negated.\n   - Reflecting triangle ABC over the y-axis results in triangle A'B'C' where the x-coordinates of the vertices are negated.\n\n6. **Interactive Learning**: Engaging in interactive activities, such as using graphing software or simulations, can help visualize how triangles are reflected across various lines, including the x-axis, y-axis, and other lines like y=x or y=-x.\n\nIn summary, reflections transform triangles into congruent figures while preserving distances and angles, but they also change the orientation of the triangle. Understanding these properties is essential for studying geometric transformations and congruence in geometry.
