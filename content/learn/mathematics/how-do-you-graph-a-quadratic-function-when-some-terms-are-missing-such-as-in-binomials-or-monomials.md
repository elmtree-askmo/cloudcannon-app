    To graph a quadratic function when some terms are missing, such as in binomials or monomials, you can follow a systematic approach that focuses on the key characteristics of the quadratic function. Hereâ€™s how to do it:\n\n### Steps to Graph Quadratic Functions with Missing Terms\n\n1. **Identify the Form**: \n   - A quadratic function can be in the form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $. If it is missing terms, it may look like $ y = ax^2 + c $ (monomial) or $ y = ax^2 + bx $ (binomial).\n\n2. **Determine the Vertex**:\n   - Use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n     $$\n     x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n     $$\n   - If the linear term $ b $ is missing (as in a monomial), then $ b = 0 $, and the x-coordinate of the vertex simplifies to $ x = 0 $.\n   - Substitute this x-coordinate back into the function to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n3. **Find the Axis of Symmetry**:\n   - The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. For the vertex at \( (h, k) \), the axis of symmetry is $ x = h $.\n\n4. **Plot the Vertex**:\n   - Mark the vertex on the graph. This point is crucial as it represents the highest or lowest point of the parabola, depending on the value of $ a $.\n\n5. **Choose Additional Points**:\n   - Select x-values on either side of the vertex to find additional points. Substitute these x-values into the quadratic function to calculate corresponding y-values.\n   - For example, if your vertex is at \( (0, k) \), you might choose $ x = -1 $ and $ x = 1 $ to find points on the parabola.\n\n6. **Draw the Parabola**:\n   - Connect the plotted points with a smooth curve to form the parabola. Ensure that the graph reflects the symmetry about the axis of symmetry.\n\n### Example\nConsider the quadratic function $ y = x^2 + 6 $ (a monomial). \n\n1. **Identify the Vertex**:\n   - Here, $ a = 1 $ and $ b = 0 $. The x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n     $$\n     x = -\frac{0}{2 \cdot 1} = 0\n     $$\n   - Substitute $ x = 0 $ into the function to find the y-coordinate:\n     $$\n     y = 0^2 + 6 = 6\n     $$\n   - Thus, the vertex is at \( (0, 6) \).\n\n2. **Axis of Symmetry**:\n   - The axis of symmetry is $ x = 0 $.\n\n3. **Plot the Vertex**:\n   - Plot the point \( (0, 6) \).\n\n4. **Choose Additional Points**:\n   - For $ x = -1 $:\n     $$\n     y = (-1)^2 + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \quad \text{(point: } (-1, 7) \text{)}\n     $$\n   - For $ x = 1 $:\n     $$\n     y = (1)^2 + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \quad \text{(point: } (1, 7) \text{)}\n     $$\n\n5. **Draw the Parabola**:\n   - Connect the points \( (0, 6) \), \( (-1, 7) \), and \( (1, 7) \) with a smooth curve.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph quadratic functions even when some terms are missing. The focus on the vertex and axis of symmetry remains crucial in these cases.
