    What are like terms in algebraic expressions?
answer: >-
    In algebra, like terms are defined as terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers, although they may have different coefficients. For example, the terms $5x^2$ and $2x^2$ are like terms because they both contain the variable $x$ raised to the power of 2. \n\nTo identify like terms, you can follow these steps:\n1. Compare the variables in the expression.\n2. Check the exponents of those variables.\n\nIf both the variables and their corresponding exponents match, the terms are considered like terms. For instance, in the expression $3y + 5y$, both terms are like terms because they share the same variable $y$ with the same exponent (which is 1, though it is often not written).\n\nCombining like terms is a fundamental operation in algebra, as it allows for the simplification of expressions. For example, $2x + 3x$ can be simplified to $5x$ by adding the coefficients (2 and 3) while keeping the variable $x$ unchanged.\n\nIn contrast, unlike terms have different variables or different powers, such as $7z$ and $25r$, which cannot be combined. \n\nOverall, recognizing and combining like terms is essential for simplifying algebraic expressions effectively.
