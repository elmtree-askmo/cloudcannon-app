answer: >-
    To determine the direction in which a parabola opens, you can analyze the coefficient of the quadratic term in the vertex form of a quadratic function. The vertex form is expressed as:\n\n$$\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n$$\n\nwhere $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola, and $a$ is a coefficient that influences the direction of opening.\n\n1. **Sign of the Coefficient $a$**:\n   - If $a > 0$, the parabola opens **upwards**. This means that as you move away from the vertex in both directions along the x-axis, the y-values increase.\n   - If $a < 0$, the parabola opens **downwards**. In this case, as you move away from the vertex in both directions, the y-values decrease.\n\n2. **Example**:\n   - For the function \(y = 2(x - 1)^2 + 3\), since $a = 2 > 0$, the parabola opens upwards.\n   - For the function \(y = -3(x + 2)^2 - 1\), since $a = -3 < 0$, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation**:\n   - When graphing a quadratic function, you can visually confirm the direction of opening by plotting the vertex and additional points. The shape of the graph will clearly indicate whether it opens upwards or downwards.\n\nIn summary, the direction in which a parabola opens is determined by the sign of the coefficient $a$ in the vertex form of the quadratic function.
