    To determine the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a graph, you can follow these steps:\n\n### X-Intercepts\nThe x-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is zero. To find the x-intercept(s) of a function or equation, you set \( y \) equal to zero and solve for \( x \). \n\n**Steps:**\n1. Set \( y = 0 \) in the equation.\n2. Solve the resulting equation for \( x \).\n3. The solutions will give you the x-intercept(s), which can be expressed as points in the form \( (x, 0) \).\n\n**Example:**\nFor the equation \( y = 3x - 1 \):\n- Set \( y = 0 \):\n  $$\n  0 = 3x - 1\n  $$\n- Solve for \( x \):\n  $$\n  3x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{3}\n  $$\n- Thus, the x-intercept is \( \left(\frac{1}{3}, 0\right) \).\n\n### Y-Intercepts\nThe y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. At this point, the x-coordinate is zero. To find the y-intercept(s), you set \( x \) equal to zero and solve for \( y \).\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Set \( x = 0 \) in the equation.\n2. Solve the resulting equation for \( y \).\n3. The solutions will give you the y-intercept(s), which can be expressed as points in the form \( (0, y) \).\n\n**Example:**\nFor the same equation \( y = 3x - 1 \):\n- Set \( x = 0 \):\n  $$\n  y = 3(0) - 1 = -1\n  $$\n- Thus, the y-intercept is \( (0, -1) \).\n\n### Summary\n- **X-Intercept**: Set \( y = 0 \) and solve for \( x \).\n- **Y-Intercept**: Set \( x = 0 \) and solve for \( y \).\n\nThese intercepts are crucial for graphing functions, as they provide key points that help define the shape and position of the graph on the Cartesian plane.
