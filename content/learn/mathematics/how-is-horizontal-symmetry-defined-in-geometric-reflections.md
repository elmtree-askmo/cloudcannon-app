    How is horizontal symmetry defined in geometric reflections?
answer: >-
    Horizontal symmetry in geometric reflections is defined by the presence of a horizontal line of symmetry that divides an object into two identical halves. This line runs from left to right (or vice versa) across the object. When an object exhibits horizontal symmetry, it means that if you were to fold the object along this horizontal line, the two halves would match perfectly, creating mirror images of each other.\n\nFor example, consider a shape like a rectangle or a butterfly. If you draw a horizontal line through the center of the shape, the top half will be a mirror image of the bottom half. This property is crucial in understanding how reflections work in geometry, as it demonstrates that the shape remains unchanged in appearance when reflected across this line.\n\nIn mathematical terms, if a point $(x, y)$ lies on the shape, its reflection across the horizontal line of symmetry (let's say at $y = k$) would be the point $(x, 2k - y)$. This transformation effectively flips the point over the line, maintaining the distance from the line of symmetry.\n\nOverall, horizontal symmetry is a specific case of reflection symmetry, where the line of reflection is horizontal, and it plays a significant role in the study of geometric figures and their properties.
