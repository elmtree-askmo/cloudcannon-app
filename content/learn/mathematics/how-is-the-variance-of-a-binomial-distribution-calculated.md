    How is the variance of a binomial distribution calculated?
answer: >-
    The variance of a binomial distribution is a measure of the dispersion of the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It quantifies how much the number of successes is expected to vary from the mean (expected value).\n\nThe formula for the variance of a binomial distribution is given by:\n\n$$\n\sigma^2 = npq\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( n \) is the number of trials,\n- \( p \) is the probability of success on each trial,\n- \( q \) is the probability of failure, which can be calculated as \( q = 1 - p \).\n\n### Derivation of the Variance\n\nTo derive the variance, we start with the general formula for variance:\n\n$$\n\text{Variance}(\sigma^2) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2\n$$\n\n1. **Calculate the expected value \( E(X) \)**:\n   The expected value for a binomial distribution is given by:\n   $$\n   E(X) = np\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate \( E(X^2) \)**:\n   The second moment \( E(X^2) \) can be derived using the properties of the binomial distribution, leading to:\n   $$\n   E(X^2) = np(1 - p) + (np)^2\n   $$\n\n3. **Substituting into the variance formula**:\n   Now, substituting \( E(X) \) and \( E(X^2) \) into the variance formula gives:\n   $$\n   \sigma^2 = np(1 - p) + (np)^2 - (np)^2 = np(1 - p) = npq\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nFor example, if you have a binomial distribution with \( n = 150 \) trials and a probability of success \( p = 0.6 \), the probability of failure \( q \) would be \( 1 - p = 0.4 \). The variance can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\sigma^2 = npq = 150 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 = 36\n$$\n\nThis means that the variance of the distribution is 36, indicating the spread of the number of successes around the mean.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the variance of a binomial distribution is calculated using the formula \( \sigma^2 = npq \), where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( p \) is the probability of success, and \( q \) is the probability of failure. This measure helps in understanding the variability of the number of successes in a series of independent trials.
