    The basic algebraic rules for multiplying expressions with common bases are essential for simplifying expressions involving exponents. Here are the key rules:\n\n1. **Product Rule**: When multiplying two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents. This can be expressed as:\n   $$ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} $$\n   For example, if you have $ x^2 \cdot x^3 $, you can combine the exponents to get:\n   $$ x^2 \cdot x^3 = x^{2+3} = x^5 $$\n\n2. **Quotient Rule**: When dividing two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents:\n   $$ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} $$\n   For instance, if you have $ \frac{x^5}{x^2} $, you can simplify it as follows:\n   $$ \frac{x^5}{x^2} = x^{5-2} = x^3 $$\n\n3. **Power of a Power Rule**: When raising an expression with an exponent to another exponent, you multiply the exponents:\n   $$ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $$\n   For example, \( (x^2)^3 \) simplifies to:\n   $$ (x^2)^3 = x^{2 \cdot 3} = x^6 $$\n\nThese rules are fundamental in algebra and are widely used to simplify expressions involving exponents. Understanding and applying these rules correctly can help avoid common mistakes, such as incorrectly adding or multiplying exponents.
