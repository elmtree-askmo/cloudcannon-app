    What is the McDonald's Chicken Nuggets Problem?
answer: >-
    The McDonald's Chicken Nuggets Problem, also known as the Chicken McNugget theorem, is a classic problem in number theory that explores the combinations of Chicken McNuggets sold in specific pack sizes. McDonald's originally sold Chicken McNuggets in boxes of 6, 9, and 20 pieces. The problem investigates which quantities of nuggets can be purchased using these pack sizes and identifies the largest number of nuggets that cannot be obtained through any combination of these packs.\n\nAccording to the Chicken McNugget theorem, for any two relatively prime positive integers $ m $ and $ n $, the greatest integer that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of $ m $ and $ n $ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\ng(m, n) = mn - m - n\n$$\n\nIn the case of the Chicken McNugget problem, if we consider the pack sizes of 6 and 9, they are not relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 3). However, when we include the pack size of 20, we can analyze combinations of 6 and 20, or 9 and 20.\n\nThe largest number of Chicken McNuggets that cannot be purchased using any combination of the packs of 6 and 9 is 43. However, once you reach 44 nuggets, you can purchase any quantity of nuggets greater than 43 using combinations of these pack sizes. \n\nFor example:\n- To purchase 15 nuggets, you can buy one box of 6 and one box of 9.\n- To purchase 17 nuggets, it is impossible to do so with the available pack sizes.\n- To purchase 53 nuggets, you can buy one box of 6, three boxes of 9, and one box of 20.\n\nThis problem not only serves as an interesting mathematical puzzle but also connects to broader concepts in combinatorial number theory, such as the Frobenius coin problem.
