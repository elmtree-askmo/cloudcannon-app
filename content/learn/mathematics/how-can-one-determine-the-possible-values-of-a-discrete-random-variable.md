    How can one determine the possible values of a discrete random variable?
answer: >-
    To determine the possible values of a discrete random variable, one must first understand the nature of the random variable itself. A discrete random variable is defined as one that can take on a finite or countably infinite number of values. The process of identifying the possible values involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the Random Variable**: Clearly define what the random variable represents in the context of the experiment or situation. For example, if the random variable $X$ represents the number of heads obtained when flipping a coin three times, then $X$ can take on values based on the outcomes of those flips.\n\n2. **List All Possible Outcomes**: Identify all the possible outcomes of the experiment. For instance, when flipping a coin three times, the possible outcomes for the number of heads are 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Construct the Probability Distribution**: The probability distribution of a discrete random variable lists all possible values along with their corresponding probabilities. This can be represented in a table format, where one column lists the possible values $x$ and the other column lists the probabilities \(P(x)\) that the random variable takes those values. For example, if $X$ is the number of heads in three flips, the probability distribution might look like this:\n\n   | $x$ | \(P(x)\) |\n   |-------|----------|\n   | 0     | 0.125    |\n   | 1     | 0.375    |\n   | 2     | 0.375    |\n   | 3     | 0.125    |\n\n4. **Use the Probability Mass Function (pmf)**: The probability mass function (pmf) provides a formal way to express the probabilities associated with each possible value of the discrete random variable. For a discrete random variable $X$, the pmf is defined as \(f(x) = P(X = x)\), which gives the probability that $X$ takes the value $x$.\n\n5. **Countable Values**: Ensure that the set of possible values is countable. This means that you can list them out, even if the list is infinite (e.g., the number of times a certain event occurs in a Poisson process).\n\nBy following these steps, one can effectively determine the possible values of a discrete random variable and construct its probability distribution, which is essential for further statistical analysis and calculations, such as finding the expected value or variance.
