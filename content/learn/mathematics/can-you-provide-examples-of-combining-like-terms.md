    Combining like terms is a fundamental concept in algebra that involves simplifying expressions by adding or subtracting terms that have the same variables and exponents. Here are some examples to illustrate this process:\n\n### Example 1:\nConsider the expression:\n$$\n2x + 5y - x + 4y\n$$\nIn this expression, we can identify the like terms:\n- For the variable $x$: $2x$ and $-x$\n- For the variable $y$: $5y$ and $4y$\n\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n(2x - x) + (5y + 4y) = x + 9y\n$$\n\n### Example 2:\nLet's simplify the expression:\n$$\n5x + 9 + 2x\n$$\nHere, the like terms are:\n- $5x$ and $2x$ (both are $x$ terms)\n- $9$ (a constant term)\n\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n(5x + 2x) + 9 = 7x + 9\n$$\n\n### Example 3:\nConsider the expression:\n$$\n7xy + 6y + 6xy\n$$\nIn this case, the like terms are:\n- $7xy$ and $6xy$\n- $6y$ (a different term)\n\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n(7xy + 6xy) + 6y = 13xy + 6y\n$$\n\n### Example 4:\nFor a more complex expression:\n$$\n3x^2 + 4x - 2 + 5x^2 - 3x + 7\n$$\nThe like terms are:\n- $3x^2$ and $5x^2$\n- $4x$ and $-3x$\n- $-2$ and $7$\n\nCombining these gives:\n$$\n(3x^2 + 5x^2) + (4x - 3x) + (-2 + 7) = 8x^2 + x + 5\n$$\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to identify and combine like terms to simplify algebraic expressions effectively.
