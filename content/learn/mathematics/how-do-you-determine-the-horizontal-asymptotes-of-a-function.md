answer: >-
    To determine the horizontal asymptotes of a function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Evaluate the Limits**: Calculate the limits of the function as \( x \) approaches positive and negative infinity:\n   - Find \( \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \)\n   - Find \( \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) \)\n\n2. **Identify the Horizontal Asymptotes**: \n   - If either of these limits results in a real number \( k \), then the horizontal asymptote can be expressed as \( y = k \).\n   - If the limit as \( x \to \infty \) is a real number, it indicates a horizontal asymptote at that value. Similarly, if the limit as \( x \to -\infty \) is a real number, it indicates another horizontal asymptote.\n\n3. **Consider the Degrees of Polynomials**: For rational functions (functions of the form \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P \) and \( Q \) are polynomials), the degrees of the numerator and denominator play a crucial role:\n   - If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \) (the x-axis).\n   - If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator.\n   - If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\n### Examples:\n- For the function \( f(x) = \frac{3x^2 + 2x - 1}{4x^2 + 3x - 2} \):\n  - The degrees of the numerator and denominator are both 2. The leading coefficients are 3 and 4, respectively. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{3}{4} \).\n\n- For the function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{2x} \):\n  - The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (1), so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{1}{2} \).\n\n- For the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \):\n  - Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\n### Special Cases:\n- For exponential functions of the form \( f(x) = ab^{kx} + c \), the horizontal asymptote is always \( y = c \) as \( x \) approaches infinity.\n\nIn summary, to find horizontal asymptotes, evaluate the limits at infinity, consider the degrees of polynomials in rational functions, and apply the appropriate rules based on the function's form.
