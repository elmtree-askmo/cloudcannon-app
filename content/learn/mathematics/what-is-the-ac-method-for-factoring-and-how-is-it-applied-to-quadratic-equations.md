    What is the A.C method for factoring, and how is it applied to quadratic equations?

    The A.C method for factoring is a systematic technique used to factor quadratic equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where the leading coefficient $a$ is not equal to 1. This method is particularly useful when the quadratic does not easily factor into integers.\n\n### Steps to Apply the A.C Method:\n\n1. **Identify the Coefficients**: Start with the quadratic equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$. Identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n2. **Calculate $ac$**: Multiply the leading coefficient $a$ by the constant term $c$. This product is denoted as $ac$.\n\n3. **Find Two Numbers**: Look for two integers that multiply to $ac$ and add up to $b$. These two numbers will help in rewriting the middle term of the quadratic.\n\n4. **Rewrite the Equation**: Use the two numbers found in the previous step to split the middle term $bx$ into two terms.\n\n5. **Factor by Grouping**: Group the terms in pairs and factor out the common factors from each group.\n\n6. **Final Factorization**: Combine the factors to express the quadratic as a product of two binomials.\n\n### Example:\n\nConsider the quadratic equation $4x^2 + 8x + 3$.\n\n1. **Identify Coefficients**: Here, $a = 4$, $b = 8$, and $c = 3$.\n2. **Calculate $ac$**: $ac = 4 \times 3 = 12$.\n3. **Find Two Numbers**: We need two numbers that multiply to $12$ and add to $8$. The numbers $6$ and $2$ satisfy this condition.\n4. **Rewrite the Equation**: Rewrite $8x$ as $6x + 2x$:\n   $$\n   4x^2 + 6x + 2x + 3\n   $$\n5. **Factor by Grouping**: Group the terms:\n   $$\n   (4x^2 + 6x) + (2x + 3)\n   $$\n   Factor out the common factors:\n   $$\n   2x(2x + 3) + 1(2x + 3)\n   $$\n6. **Final Factorization**: Combine the factors:\n   $$\n   (2x + 3)(2x + 1)\n   $$\n\nThus, the quadratic $4x^2 + 8x + 3$ factors to \((2x + 3)(2x + 1)\).\n\nThis method is effective for quadratics where the leading coefficient is greater than 1, allowing for a structured approach to factorization.
