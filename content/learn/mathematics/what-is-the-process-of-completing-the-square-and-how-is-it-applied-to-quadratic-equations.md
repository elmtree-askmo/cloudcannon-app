    Completing the square is a method used to convert a quadratic equation into vertex form, which is particularly useful for graphing and solving quadratic equations. The process involves manipulating the equation to form a perfect square trinomial. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to complete the square:\n\n### Steps to Complete the Square\n\n1. **Start with the Standard Form**: Begin with a quadratic equation in the standard form:\n   $$ \n   ax^2 + bx + c \n   $$\n\n2. **Isolate the Quadratic and Linear Terms**: If $ a $ is not 1, factor it out from the first two terms:\n   $$ \n   a(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x) + c \n   $$\n\n3. **Find the Value to Complete the Square**: Take the coefficient of $ x $ (which is $ \frac{b}{a} $), divide it by 2, and square it:\n   $$ \n   \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 \n   $$\n\n4. **Add and Subtract This Value**: Add and subtract this value inside the parentheses:\n   $$ \n   a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\right) + c \n   $$\n\n5. **Rewrite as a Perfect Square**: The expression inside the parentheses can now be factored as a perfect square:\n   $$ \n   a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\right) + c \n   $$\n\n6. **Simplify**: Distribute $ a $ and combine constants:\n   $$ \n   a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - a\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c \n   $$\n\n7. **Final Vertex Form**: This results in the vertex form of the quadratic equation:\n   $$ \n   a\left(x - h\right)^2 + k \n   $$\n   where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's apply this process to the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 6x + 5 $:\n\n1. Start with $ x^2 + 6x + 5 $.\n2. The coefficient of $ x $ is 6. Half of this is 3, and squaring it gives 9.\n3. Rewrite the equation:\n   $$\n   x^2 + 6x + 9 - 4 = (x + 3)^2 - 4\n   $$\n4. The vertex form is \( (x + 3)^2 - 4 \), indicating the vertex is at \( (-3, -4) \).\n\n### Applications\n\nCompleting the square is not only useful for converting quadratic equations into vertex form but also plays a crucial role in deriving the quadratic formula. It allows for easier graphing of parabolas and helps in analyzing the properties of quadratic functions, such as their vertex, axis of symmetry, and direction of opening.\n\nIn summary, completing the square is a powerful algebraic technique that transforms quadratic equations into a more manageable form, facilitating various mathematical applications.
