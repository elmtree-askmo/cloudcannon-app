    How is a quadratic equation formed from the intersection of a line and a circle?
answer: >-
    To form a quadratic equation from the intersection of a line and a circle, you follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the equations**: Start with the equation of the circle, which is typically in the form:\n   $$\n   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n   $$\n   where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. The equation of the line can be expressed in slope-intercept form:\n   $$\n   y = mx + b\n   $$\n   where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Substitute the line's equation into the circle's equation**: Replace $y$ in the circle's equation with the expression from the line's equation. This results in:\n   $$\n   (x - h)^2 + (mx + b - k)^2 = r^2\n   $$\n\n3. **Expand and rearrange**: Expand the equation and combine like terms. This will yield a quadratic equation in the standard form:\n   $$\n   Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n   $$\n   where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are coefficients derived from the expansion.\n\n4. **Analyze the quadratic equation**: The nature of the intersection can be determined using the discriminant $D$ of the quadratic equation, calculated as:\n   $$\n   D = B^2 - 4AC\n   $$\n   - If $D > 0$, the line intersects the circle at two points.\n   - If $D = 0$, the line is tangent to the circle, touching it at exactly one point.\n   - If $D < 0$, there is no intersection between the line and the circle.\n\n### Example\nConsider a circle with the equation:\n$$\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 16\n$$\nand a line given by:\n$$\ny = 2x + 1\n$$\n\n1. Substitute the line's equation into the circle's equation:\n   $$\n   (x - 2)^2 + (2x + 1 - 3)^2 = 16\n   $$\n   Simplifying gives:\n   $$\n   (x - 2)^2 + (2x - 2)^2 = 16\n   $$\n\n2. Expand:\n   $$\n   (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (4x^2 - 8x + 4) = 16\n   $$\n   Combine like terms:\n   $$\n   5x^2 - 12x + 8 = 16\n   $$\n   Rearranging gives:\n   $$\n   5x^2 - 12x - 8 = 0\n   $$\n\n3. Calculate the discriminant:\n   $$\n   D = (-12)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-8) = 144 + 160 = 304\n   $$\n   Since $D > 0$, the line intersects the circle at two points.\n\nThis process illustrates how a quadratic equation is formed from the intersection of a line and a circle, and how to analyze the nature of that intersection using the discriminant.
