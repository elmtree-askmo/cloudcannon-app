    What are rational numbers and how are they represented?
answer: >-
    Rational numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, defined as numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. In mathematical terms, a rational number can be written in the form $ \frac{p}{q} $, where $ p $ and $ q $ are integers, and $ q $ is not equal to zero. This means that rational numbers include integers, fractions, and finite or repeating decimals. For example, numbers like $ \frac{1}{2} $, $ -\frac{3}{4} $, $ 0.3 $ (which can be expressed as $ \frac{3}{10} $), and $ 1 $ (which can be expressed as $ \frac{1}{1} $) are all rational numbers.\n\nRational numbers are universally represented by the symbol 'Q', which stands for "quotient." They are a subset of real numbers and can be plotted on the real number line. To represent a rational number on the real line, one must first determine if the number is positive or negative. Positive rational numbers are plotted to the right of zero, while negative rational numbers are plotted to the left of zero.\n\nRational numbers possess several important properties, including the closure property, which states that the sum, difference, product, or quotient (except division by zero) of any two rational numbers is also a rational number. This property is crucial for performing mathematical operations involving rational numbers.\n\nIn summary, rational numbers are integral to our mathematical world, as they encompass a wide range of numbers we encounter in everyday life, making them essential for various mathematical operations and applications.
