    Describe how normal induction can be applied to the Coin Change Problem.
answer: >-
    Normal induction, also known as mathematical induction, can be effectively applied to the Coin Change Problem to prove that any integer amount greater than or equal to a certain threshold can be formed using a specified set of coin denominations. Hereâ€™s how the process works:\n\n### Steps of Normal Induction in the Coin Change Problem\n\n1. **Define the Proposition**: Let \( P(n) \) be the proposition that an amount of $ n $ cents can be made using a given set of coin denominations. For example, if we are using 6-cent and 11-cent coins, we want to prove that \( P(n) \) holds for all $ n \geq 60 $.\n\n2. **Base Case**: Verify the base case. For $ n = 60 $, we can use $ 6 \times 10 = 60 $ cents, which shows that \( P(60) \) is true. We can also check \( P(61) \) through combinations of coins, such as $ 6 \times 5 + 11 \times 1 = 61 $, and similarly for \( P(62) \) and \( P(63) \).\n\n3. **Inductive Step**: Assume that \( P(k) \) is true for all integers $ k $ such that $ 60 \leq k \leq n $. This means we can form all amounts from 60 up to $ n $ using the coins. We need to show that \( P(n + 1) \) is also true.\n\n   - To form $ n + 1 $, we can consider two cases:\n     - If $ n + 1 $ is at least 6 cents more than a previously formed amount, we can take the amount $ n - 5 $ (which we can form by the inductive hypothesis) and add a 6-cent coin to it. Thus, \( P(n + 1) \) holds.\n     - If $ n + 1 $ is less than 6 cents more than a previously formed amount, we can check combinations that include 11-cent coins, ensuring that we can still reach $ n + 1 $ by adjusting the number of coins used.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since both the base case and the inductive step have been established, by the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that \( P(n) \) is true for all integers $ n \geq 60 $. Therefore, any amount $ n $ greater than or equal to 60 can be formed using 6-cent and 11-cent coins.\n\n### Summary\nUsing normal induction, we can systematically prove that any integer amount greater than or equal to a certain threshold can be achieved with specific coin denominations. This method not only provides a rigorous proof but also illustrates the power of induction in solving combinatorial problems like the Coin Change Problem.
