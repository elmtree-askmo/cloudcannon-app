    What is the asymptotic behavior of exponential functions?
answer: >-
    The asymptotic behavior of exponential functions is characterized primarily by their horizontal asymptote and their growth or decay patterns. Here are the key points regarding the asymptotic behavior of exponential functions:\n\n1. **Horizontal Asymptote**: Exponential functions typically have a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$. This means that as $x$ approaches negative infinity, the value of the function approaches zero but never actually reaches it. For example, in the function $y = 2^x$, as $x$ decreases, $y$ gets closer and closer to zero.\n\n2. **Behavior as $x$ Increases**: When the base $b$ of the exponential function $y = a \cdot b^x$ is greater than 1 (i.e., $b > 1$), the function exhibits exponential growth. The value of $y$ increases rapidly as $x$ increases, leading to a steep curve. Conversely, if $0 < b < 1$, the function represents exponential decay, where $y$ decreases rapidly as $x$ increases, again approaching zero but never reaching it.\n\n3. **Rate of Change**: The rate of change of exponential functions is not constant; it is proportional to the value of the function itself. This means that as $x$ increases, the change in $y$ becomes larger or smaller at an increasing rate, which is a defining characteristic of exponential growth or decay.\n\n4. **Graphical Representation**: When graphing exponential functions, the curve will always approach the horizontal asymptote (the x-axis) as $x$ approaches negative infinity. This behavior is crucial for understanding the long-term trends of exponential functions, whether they are growing or decaying.\n\nIn summary, the asymptotic behavior of exponential functions is defined by their horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$ and their rapid growth or decay characteristics, which are influenced by the base of the exponential. Understanding these properties is essential for analyzing and graphing exponential functions effectively.
