    To determine the equation of an exponential function from its graph, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Points on the Graph**: Choose at least two points on the curve of the graph. It is often helpful to select points where the graph intersects the axes, such as the y-intercept (where $x = 0$).\n\n2. **Use the Exponential Function Form**: The general form of an exponential function is given by:\n   $$\n   y = a \cdot b^x\n   $$\n   Here, $a$ is the initial value (the value of $y$ when $x = 0$), and $b$ is the base of the exponential function, which determines the growth or decay rate.\n\n3. **Substitute the First Point**: If you have a point \((x_1, y_1)\), substitute these values into the equation to solve for $a$ or $b$. If you have the y-intercept, you can directly find $a$ since $y = a$ when $x = 0$.\n\n4. **Substitute the Second Point**: Use the second point \((x_2, y_2)\) to substitute into the equation. This will allow you to solve for the other constant (either $a$ or $b$).\n\n5. **Solve for Constants**: You will now have a system of equations that you can solve to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\n6. **Write the Final Equation**: Once you have determined both constants, substitute them back into the exponential function form to write the complete equation.\n\n7. **Verify with a Third Point**: If possible, choose a third point on the graph to substitute into your final equation to ensure that it holds true. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your derived function.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have the points \((0, 4)\) and \((2, 16)\):\n\n1. From the point \((0, 4)\), we know:\n   $$\n   4 = a \cdot b^0 \implies a = 4\n   $$\n\n2. From the point \((2, 16)\):\n   $$\n   16 = 4 \cdot b^2\n   $$\n   Dividing both sides by 4 gives:\n   $$\n   4 = b^2 \implies b = 2\n   $$\n\n3. Therefore, the equation of the exponential function is:\n   $$\n   y = 4 \cdot 2^x\n   $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the equation of an exponential function from its graph.
