    How do you determine the common ratio and first term in a geometric series?
answer: >-
    To determine the common ratio and the first term in a geometric series, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the First Term (a)**: The first term of a geometric series is simply the initial value from which the series starts. For example, in the series 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., the first term $ a $ is 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Common Ratio (r)**: The common ratio is the factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term. You can find it by dividing any term by its preceding term. For instance, in the series 2, 4, 8, 16:\n   - The second term (4) divided by the first term (2) gives $ r = \frac{4}{2} = 2 $.\n   - The third term (8) divided by the second term (4) also gives $ r = \frac{8}{4} = 2 $.\n   - The fourth term (16) divided by the third term (8) gives $ r = \frac{16}{8} = 2 $.\n\nThus, for the series 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., the first term $ a $ is 2 and the common ratio $ r $ is 2.\n\nIn general, for a geometric series, the terms can be expressed as:\n- First term: $ a $\n- Second term: $ ar $\n- Third term: $ ar^2 $\n- nth term: $ ar^{n-1} $\n\nThe sum of the first $ n $ terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n$$\nS_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n$$\nwhere $ S_n $ is the sum of the first $ n $ terms, $ a $ is the first term, and $ r $ is the common ratio. \n\nThis understanding of the first term and common ratio is crucial for analyzing and summing geometric series effectively.
