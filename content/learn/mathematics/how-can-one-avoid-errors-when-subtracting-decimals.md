    To avoid errors when subtracting decimals, it is essential to follow a systematic approach that ensures accuracy. Here are some key strategies:\n\n1. **Align Decimal Points**: Always line up the decimal points of the numbers you are subtracting. This alignment is crucial for maintaining the correct place values. For example, if you are subtracting 7.45 from 12.7, write it as follows:\n\n   ```\n     12.70\n   -  7.45\n   ```\n\n   This ensures that the digits are in the correct columns.\n\n2. **Insert Zeros if Necessary**: If the numbers have a different number of decimal places, add zeros to the shorter number to make them the same length. For instance, in the example above, you can add a zero to 12.7 to make it 12.70.\n\n3. **Double-Check Decimal Placement**: Before performing the subtraction, double-check that the decimal points are correctly aligned. Misplacing the decimal point can lead to significant errors in the result.\n\n4. **Perform the Subtraction from Right to Left**: Subtract as you would with whole numbers, starting from the rightmost digit and moving left. If you need to borrow, ensure that you regroup correctly.\n\n5. **Place the Decimal Point in the Result**: After completing the subtraction, place the decimal point in the answer directly below the aligned decimal points of the original numbers.\n\n6. **Use Estimation**: After calculating the result, use estimation to verify if your answer makes sense. This can help catch any potential errors in your calculations.\n\n7. **Practice Regularly**: The more you practice subtracting decimals, the more comfortable you will become with the process, which can help reduce errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you can minimize the risk of errors when subtracting decimals and ensure that your calculations are accurate.
