    How do you isolate a variable when solving a linear inequality?
answer: >-
    To isolate a variable when solving a linear inequality, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the Variable**: The first step is to get the variable on one side of the inequality. This is done using inverse operations, similar to solving linear equations. You can add or subtract terms to move constant values to the opposite side of the inequality.\n\n   For example, to solve the inequality:\n   $$\n   x + 3 > 10\n   $$\n   You would subtract 3 from both sides:\n   $$\n   x + 3 - 3 > 10 - 3\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   x > 7\n   $$\n\n2. **Use Multiplication or Division**: If the variable is multiplied or divided by a coefficient, perform the operation while being cautious about the inequality sign. If you multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the direction of the inequality sign.\n\n   For example, consider the inequality:\n   $$\n   -2x < 6\n   $$\n   To isolate $x$, divide both sides by -2, remembering to flip the inequality sign:\n   $$\n   x > -3\n   $$\n\n3. **Identify Critical Points**: If the inequality involves a rational expression, set the numerator and denominator equal to zero to find critical points. These points will help in determining the intervals to test.\n\n4. **Test Intervals**: Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals. Choose test points from each interval to determine where the inequality holds true.\n\n5. **Express the Solution**: Finally, express the solution in interval notation or as a compound inequality, depending on the context of the problem.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively isolate the variable and solve linear inequalities. Remember that the key difference from solving equations is the need to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
