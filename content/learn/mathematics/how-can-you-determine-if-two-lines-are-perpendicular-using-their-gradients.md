    How can you determine if two lines are perpendicular using their gradients?
answer: >-
    To determine if two lines are perpendicular using their gradients (or slopes), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Equations**: Ensure that the equations of the lines are in slope-intercept form, which is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\n2. **Extract the Slopes**: From the equations, identify the slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ of the two lines.\n\n3. **Check the Perpendicularity Condition**: The lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is equal to -1. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$\n   m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1\n   $$\n   Alternatively, if you know the slope of one line, the slope of the line that is perpendicular to it can be found by taking the negative reciprocal of that slope:\n   $$\n   m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}\n   $$\n\n### Example\nConsider the following two lines:\n- Line 1: $y = 3x + 2$ (slope $m_1 = 3$)\n- Line 2: $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 1$ (slope $m_2 = -\frac{1}{3}$)\n\nTo check if they are perpendicular:\n- Calculate the product of the slopes:\n  $$\n  m_1 \cdot m_2 = 3 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = -1\n  $$\nSince the product is $-1$, the two lines are indeed perpendicular.\n\n### Additional Note\nIn the context of geometry, horizontal and vertical lines are always perpendicular. A horizontal line has a slope of 0, while a vertical line has an undefined slope, and they intersect at a right angle.\n\nIn summary, the key relationships for determining perpendicular lines are:\n- **Perpendicular Lines**: Slopes are negative reciprocals \( (m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1) \) or $ m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1} $.
