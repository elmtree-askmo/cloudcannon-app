answer: >-
    Disjunctive Syllogism is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic that deals with disjunctions, which are statements connected by the logical "OR" operator (denoted as âˆ¨). The rule can be formally stated as follows:\n\n1. If we have a disjunction $ P \lor Q $ (meaning either $ P $ is true, or $ Q $ is true, or both),\n2. And we know that $ \neg P $ (the negation of $ P $) is true,\n3. Then we can conclude that $ Q $ must be true.\n\nThis can be summarized in a logical form:\n- Premise 1: $ P \lor Q $\n- Premise 2: $ \neg P $\n- Conclusion: $ Q $\n\n### Example of Disjunctive Syllogism\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n- Premise 1: "I will either go to the park (P) or stay home (Q)." This can be expressed as $ P \lor Q $.\n- Premise 2: "I do not go to the park." This is expressed as $ \neg P $.\n\nUsing Disjunctive Syllogism, we can conclude:\n- Conclusion: "I must be staying home." This is expressed as $ Q $.\n\nIn this example, since we know that one of the two options must be true (going to the park or staying home), and we have established that the first option (going to the park) is false, we can logically deduce that the second option (staying home) must be true.\n\n### Truth Table Verification\n\nTo further illustrate the validity of Disjunctive Syllogism, we can use a truth table:\n\n| $ P $ | $ Q $ | $ P \lor Q $ | $ \neg P $ | Conclusion $ Q $ |\n|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| T       | T       | T              | F             | T                   |\n| T       | F       | T              | F             | F                   |\n| F       | T       | T              | T             | T                   |\n| F       | F       | F              | T             | F                   |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that when $ P \lor Q $ is true and $ \neg P $ is true, $ Q $ must also be true, confirming the validity of the Disjunctive Syllogism rule.\n\nIn summary, Disjunctive Syllogism is a powerful logical tool that allows us to derive conclusions from disjunctive statements when one of the disjuncts is negated.
