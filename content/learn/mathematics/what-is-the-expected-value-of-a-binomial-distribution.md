    The expected value of a binomial distribution is calculated using the formula E(X) = n * p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. This value represents the average number of successes expected over many independent trials.

    What is the expected value of a binomial distribution?
answer: >-
    The expected value of a binomial distribution is a fundamental concept in probability theory. For a binomial random variable \(X\) that represents the number of successes in \(n\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with a probability of success \(p\), the expected value (or mean) is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nE(X) = n \cdot p\n$$\n\nThis formula indicates that the expected value is the product of the number of trials \(n\) and the probability of success \(p\). \n\nFor example, if you were to flip a fair coin 100 times (where the probability of getting heads, \(p\), is \(0.5\)), the expected number of heads would be:\n\n$$\nE(X) = 100 \cdot 0.5 = 50\n$$\n\nThis means that, on average, you would expect to get 50 heads in 100 flips of the coin.\n\nThe expected value provides a measure of the central tendency of the distribution, giving insight into what one might anticipate as the average outcome over many trials. In summary, the expected value of a binomial distribution succinctly captures the average number of successes one can expect when conducting a series of independent trials.
