    What distinguishes a proposition from a non-proposition?
answer: >-
    A proposition is defined as a declarative sentence that can be classified as either true or false. This means that a proposition must have a definitive truth value, allowing it to be evaluated in terms of its truthfulness. For example, the statement "The Eiffel Tower is in Paris" is a proposition because it can be verified as true.\n\nIn contrast, a non-proposition is a statement that cannot be classified as true or false. Non-propositions include questions, commands, exclamations, and paradoxes. For instance, the statement "What time is it?" is a question and does not have a truth value; therefore, it is not a proposition. Other examples of non-propositions include commands like "Close the door!" and expressions of desire such as "I wish I had a bike."\n\nThe key distinction lies in the ability to assign a truth value: propositions can be evaluated as true or false, while non-propositions cannot. Understanding this difference is crucial in logical reasoning, as it helps in identifying which statements can be used in logical operations and truth tables.
