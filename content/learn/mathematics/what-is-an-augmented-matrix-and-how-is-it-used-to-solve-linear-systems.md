    An augmented matrix is a matrix representation of a system of linear equations, combining coefficients and constants. It is used to solve linear systems through row operations, transforming it into simpler forms like Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) for easy solution extraction.

    What is an augmented matrix, and how is it used to solve linear systems?
answer: >-
    An **augmented matrix** is a matrix that represents a system of linear equations by combining the coefficients of the variables with the constants from the equations into a single matrix. It is typically denoted as $[A|b]$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix and $b$ is the constant vector.\n\n### Construction of an Augmented Matrix\n\nTo construct an augmented matrix, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the System of Equations**: Start with a system of linear equations. For example:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   2x + 3y &= 5 \\\n   4x + y &= 11\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n\n2. **Form the Coefficient Matrix**: Extract the coefficients of the variables from each equation and organize them into a matrix. For the above equations, the coefficient matrix $ A $ is:\n   $$\n   A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n3. **Combine with the Constants**: Append the constants from the right-hand side of the equations to form the augmented matrix:\n   $$\n   \begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 3 & | & 5 \\\n   4 & 1 & | & 11\n   \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n### Role of Augmented Matrices in Solving Linear Systems\n\nThe augmented matrix is used to solve linear systems through various methods, primarily through row operations. Hereâ€™s how it works:\n\n1. **Formulate the Augmented Matrix**: As shown above, convert the system of equations into an augmented matrix.\n\n2. **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: Use elementary row operations to manipulate the augmented matrix into a simpler form, such as Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). The three types of row operations are:\n   - **Row swapping**: Interchanging two rows.\n   - **Row multiplication**: Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.\n   - **Row addition**: Adding or subtracting a multiple of one row to another row.\n\n3. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in RREF, you can easily read off the solutions to the system of equations. If the system has a unique solution, it will be evident from the final form of the augmented matrix.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the system of equations:\n$$\n\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 5 \\\n4x + 6y &= 10\n\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding augmented matrix is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & | & 5 \\\n4 & 6 & | & 10\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nUsing row operations, you can simplify this matrix. For instance, you could multiply the first row by 2 and subtract it from the second row to eliminate $ x $:\n$$\nR_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 2R_1\n$$\nThis results in:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & | & 5 \\\n0 & 0 & | & 0\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the second equation is dependent on the first, leading to infinitely many solutions along a line in the $ xy $-plane.\n\nIn summary, the augmented matrix is a crucial tool in linear algebra for efficiently solving systems of linear equations through systematic manipulation and application of row operations.
