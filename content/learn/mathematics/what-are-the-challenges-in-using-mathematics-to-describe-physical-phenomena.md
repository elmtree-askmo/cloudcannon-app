    What are the challenges in using mathematics to describe physical phenomena?
answer: >-
    The challenges in using mathematics to describe physical phenomena are multifaceted and can significantly impact students' understanding and problem-solving abilities in physics. Here are some key challenges identified in the gathered information:\n\n1. **Integration of Theory and Reality**: Students often struggle to relate theoretical models to real-world phenomena. This difficulty arises when they attempt to combine mathematical operations with conceptual reasoning about physical phenomena. Many students find it challenging to realize that equations can express profound meanings, which can hinder their ability to apply mathematical concepts effectively in physics (Kuo et al., 2012; Michelsen, 2006).\n\n2. **Mathematical Rigor and Symbolism**: The use of mathematical symbols and rigorous methods is essential for effective problem-solving in physics. However, barriers exist in the teaching and learning processes, as students may not fully grasp the significance of these symbols or how to manipulate them in the context of physical problems (Badmus et al., 2020).\n\n3. **Cognitive and Affective Factors**: Research indicates that students' emotional responses to problem-solving activities can affect their performance in physics. The cognitive load associated with understanding complex mathematical concepts can lead to frustration and disengagement, further complicating their ability to solve physics problems (Hamerski et al., 2020).\n\n4. **Physical Meaning in Mathematical Models**: A common limitation in mathematical modeling is the requirement for a clear physical meaning at each stage of constructing a model. Students may struggle to find or articulate this meaning, which can lead to confusion and misapplication of mathematical principles (Křížek & Neittaanmäki).\n\n5. **Educational Approaches**: The focus of physics education often leans towards preparing students for problem-solving using formulas rather than fostering discussions about the relationships between theoretical models and real-world applications. This approach can limit students' understanding of the broader implications of mathematical models in physics (Tuminaro & Redish, 2007).\n\n6. **Complexity of Mathematical Models**: The inherent complexity of mathematical models can pose challenges in accurately describing physical phenomena. For instance, models may simplify or overlook critical dynamics, leading to inaccuracies in predictions and interpretations (Nature Physics).\n\nIn summary, the challenges in using mathematics to describe physical phenomena stem from a combination of cognitive, educational, and conceptual factors. Addressing these challenges requires a more integrated approach to teaching physics that emphasizes the connections between mathematical theory and real-world applications, as well as fostering a deeper understanding of the physical meanings behind mathematical models.
