    What is degree centrality in network analysis?
answer: >-
    Degree centrality is a fundamental measure in network analysis that quantifies the number of direct connections a node has within a network. It is defined as the count of edges incident to a node, which indicates how well-connected that node is to others. In mathematical terms, for a node \( n_i \), the degree centrality can be represented as \( d(n_i) \), where \( d(n_i) \) is the number of edges connected to node \( n_i \).\n\nIn an undirected binary graph, degree centrality simply counts the total number of connections (or ties) a node has. For example, if a node has 5 edges connecting it to other nodes, its degree centrality is 5. In directed networks, degree centrality can be further categorized into in-degree and out-degree, where in-degree counts the number of incoming edges and out-degree counts the number of outgoing edges.\n\nDegree centrality is often used to identify key players in a network, as nodes with higher degree centrality are typically more central and influential within the network. This measure is particularly useful in social network analysis, where a person with many friends or connections would exhibit high degree centrality.\n\nOverall, degree centrality serves as a straightforward and intuitive metric for assessing the connectivity and importance of nodes within various types of networks.
