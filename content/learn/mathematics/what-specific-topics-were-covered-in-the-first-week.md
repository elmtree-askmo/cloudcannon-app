    What specific topics were covered in the first week?
answer: >-
    In the first week of the Algebra 1 course, students will focus on the foundational concepts of algebra, specifically under the standard of "Seeing Structure in Expressions." The key topics covered include:\n\n1. **Rewriting Algebraic Expressions**: Students will work on recognizing the structure of algebraic expressions and rewriting them in different equivalent forms. This skill is crucial for understanding how to manipulate expressions effectively.\n\n2. **Properties of Real Numbers**: An introduction to the properties that govern real numbers, which serve as the basis for algebraic reasoning.\n\n3. **Variables and Expressions**: Students will become familiar with the use of variables in algebraic expressions, learning how to interpret and evaluate these expressions.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions**: Emphasis will be placed on the art of simplifying algebraic expressions, which is a fundamental skill in algebra.\n\nThese topics are designed to create a solid foundation for students, preparing them for more advanced concepts in algebra and future mathematics courses. The week aims to ensure mastery of these essential standards, setting the stage for the rest of the curriculum.
