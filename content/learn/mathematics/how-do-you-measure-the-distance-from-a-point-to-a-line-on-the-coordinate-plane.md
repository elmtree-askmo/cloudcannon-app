answer: >-
    To measure the distance from a point to a line on the coordinate plane, you can use the following method, which involves the formula for the distance from a point to a line given in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$.\n\n### Steps to Calculate the Distance\n\n1. **Identify the Line Equation**: Ensure the line is in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. If the line is given in another form (like slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$), you can rearrange it to the standard form.\n\n2. **Identify the Point**: Let the point be \(P(x_0, y_0)\).\n\n3. **Use the Distance Formula**: The distance $d$ from the point $P$ to the line can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   d = \frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\n   $$\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a line given by the equation $3x + 4y - 12 = 0$ and a point \(P(2, 3)\).\n\n1. **Identify $A$, $B$, and $C$**:\n   - Here, $A = 3$, $B = 4$, and $C = -12$.\n\n2. **Substitute the Point's Coordinates**:\n   - Substitute $x_0 = 2$ and $y_0 = 3$ into the formula:\n   $$\n   d = \frac{|3(2) + 4(3) - 12|}{\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = \frac{|6 + 12 - 12|}{\sqrt{9 + 16}} = \frac{|6|}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n   $$\n\nThus, the distance from the point \(P(2, 3)\) to the line $3x + 4y - 12 = 0$ is $1.2$ units.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis method provides a straightforward way to calculate the distance from a point to a line on the coordinate plane using algebraic representation. The formula accounts for the coefficients of the line equation and the coordinates of the point, ensuring an accurate measurement of the perpendicular distance.
