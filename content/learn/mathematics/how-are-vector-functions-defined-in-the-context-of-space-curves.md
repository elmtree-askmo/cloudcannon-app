answer: >-
    In the context of space curves, vector functions are defined as vector-valued functions that represent the position of a point in three-dimensional space as a function of a parameter, typically denoted as $ t $. A space curve can be described by a vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), which is expressed in terms of its component functions as follows:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle\n$$\n\nHere, \( x(t) \), \( y(t) \), and \( z(t) \) are real-valued functions that define the coordinates of the points on the curve as $ t $ varies. The set of points defined by these parametric equations \( x = f(t) \), \( y = g(t) \), and \( z = h(t) \) constitutes the space curve.\n\nVector functions are particularly useful because they not only provide the position of a point in space but also allow for the visualization of the curve's orientation and direction of motion. As the parameter $ t $ increases, the vector function traces out the curve in space, and the direction of the curve can be indicated by arrows along the path.\n\nIn summary, a vector function in the context of space curves is a mathematical representation that captures both the position and the trajectory of a point moving through three-dimensional space, defined by its component functions.
