    What is the difference between absolute error and relative error in measurements?
answer: >-
    The difference between absolute error and relative error in measurements is fundamental in understanding the accuracy and precision of data.\n\n1. **Absolute Error**: This is defined as the difference between the measured value and the true value. It is expressed as a positive quantity and is given in the same units as the measurement. For example, if the true mass of a sample is 50.0 g and the measured mass is 49.8 g, the absolute error can be calculated as follows:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Absolute Error} = |50.0 - 49.8| = 0.2 \text{ g}\n   $$\n\n   This value indicates how far the measurement is from the true value.\n\n2. **Relative Error**: This error expresses the absolute error as a percentage of the true value, providing context regarding the significance of the error relative to the size of the measurement. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Relative Error} = \left(\frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{True Value}}\right) \times 100\%\n   $$\n\n   For instance, if the absolute error is 0.2 g and the true value is 50.0 g, the relative error would be:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Relative Error} = \left(\frac{0.2}{50.0}\right) \times 100\% = 0.4\%\n   $$\n\nIn summary, while absolute error provides a direct measure of the error in the same units as the measurement, relative error offers a perspective on the error's significance in relation to the true value, often expressed as a percentage.
