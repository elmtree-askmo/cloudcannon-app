answer: >-
    Here are some common example problems involving vector representation and line equations, particularly in three-dimensional space:\n\n1. **Finding the Vector Equation of a Line**:\n   - **Problem**: Find the equation of the line passing through the point \( (2, 5, -4) \) and parallel to the vector \( \textbf{v} = 6\textbf{i} + 5\textbf{j} - 2\textbf{k} \).\n   - **Solution**: The vector equation of the line can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     \textbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\n     $$\n   - This can also be written in parametric form as:\n     $$\n     x = 2 + 6t, \quad y = 5 + 5t, \quad z = -4 - 2t\n     $$\n\n2. **Finding the Parametric Form from Two Points**:\n   - **Problem**: Given two points \( \textbf{p}_1 = (1, -1, 3) \) and \( \textbf{p}_2 = (2, 3, -1) \), find the parametric form of the line.\n   - **Solution**: First, calculate the direction vector \( \textbf{d} = \textbf{p}_2 - \textbf{p}_1 = (2-1, 3-(-1), -1-3) = (1, 4, -4) \). The parametric form is:\n     $$\n     \textbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\n     $$\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     x = 1 + t, \quad y = -1 + 4t, \quad z = 3 - 4t\n     $$\n\n3. **Symmetric Form of a Line**:\n   - **Problem**: Convert the parametric equations \( x = 1 + t, y = -1 + 4t, z = 3 - 4t \) into symmetric form.\n   - **Solution**: From the parametric equations, we can express \( t \) in terms of \( x, y, z \):\n     $$\n     t = x - 1, \quad t = \frac{y + 1}{4}, \quad t = 3 - z\n     $$\n   - Thus, the symmetric form is:\n     $$\n     \frac{x - 1}{1} = \frac{y + 1}{4} = \frac{3 - z}{4}\n     $$\n\n4. **Checking if a Point Lies on a Line**:\n   - **Problem**: Determine if the point \( (3, 7, -1) \) lies on the line defined by the vector equation \( \textbf{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 5 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).\n   - **Solution**: Substitute \( x = 3, y = 7, z = -1 \) into the parametric equations derived from the vector equation:\n     - From \( x = 2 + 6t \): \( 3 = 2 + 6t \) gives \( t = \frac{1}{6} \).\n     - From \( y = 5 + 5t \): \( 7 = 5 + 5t \) gives \( t = \frac{2}{5} \).\n     - From \( z = -4 - 2t \): \( -1 = -4 - 2t \) gives \( t = \frac{3}{2} \).\n   - Since the values of \( t \) are not consistent, the point \( (3, 7, -1) \) does not lie on the line.\n\nThese example problems illustrate various aspects of vector representation and line equations, including finding vector and parametric forms, converting to symmetric form, and checking points on a line.
