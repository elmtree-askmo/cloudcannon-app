    How is distance preserved during a reflection?
answer: >-
    Distance is preserved during a reflection due to the nature of isometric transformations. In geometry, a reflection is defined as a transformation that flips a figure over a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This transformation results in a mirror image of the original figure, maintaining the same size and shape.\n\n### Key Points on Distance Preservation in Reflection:\n\n1. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, which means that it preserves distances between points. When a point is reflected across a line, the distance from the original point to the line of reflection is equal to the distance from the reflected point to the line. This property ensures that the original figure and its reflection are congruent.\n\n2. **Distance Relationship**: For any point $P$ located at a distance $d$ from the line of reflection, its image $P'$ will also be at a distance $d$ on the opposite side of the line. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n   - If the distance from point $P$ to the line is $d$, then the distance from point $P'$ (the image of $P$) to the line is also $d$.\n\n3. **Geometric Interpretation**: When visualizing a reflection, consider a point $P$ and its reflection $P'$ across a line $L$. The perpendicular distance from $P$ to $L$ is equal to the perpendicular distance from $P'$ to $L$. This symmetry ensures that the distances are preserved.\n\n4. **Congruence of Figures**: Since the original figure and its reflection are congruent, all corresponding distances between points in the original figure and the reflected figure remain equal. This congruence is a fundamental characteristic of reflections.\n\n5. **Example**: If a point \(A(2, 3)\) is reflected across the y-axis, its image \(A'(-2, 3)\) will maintain the same distance from the y-axis. The distance from $A$ to the y-axis is 2 units, and the distance from $A'$ to the y-axis is also 2 units.\n\nIn summary, the preservation of distance during a reflection is a result of the isometric nature of the transformation, ensuring that the original figure and its reflection are congruent and maintain equal distances from the line of reflection.
