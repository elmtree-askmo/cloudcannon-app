answer: >-
    Elementary row operations are fundamental techniques used in matrix manipulation, particularly for solving systems of linear equations and transforming matrices into specific forms such as Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). There are three primary types of elementary row operations:\n\n1. **Row Swap**: This operation allows you to exchange the positions of any two rows in the matrix. For example, if you have a matrix and you want to swap the first row (R1) with the second row (R2), you would denote this operation as $ R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2 $.\n\n2. **Scalar Multiplication**: This operation involves multiplying all elements of a row by a non-zero constant. For instance, if you want to multiply the first row by a scalar $ k $, you would represent this operation as $ R_1 \rightarrow kR_1 $.\n\n3. **Row Addition**: This operation allows you to add a multiple of one row to another row. For example, if you want to add $ k $ times the second row to the first row, you would denote this as $ R_1 \rightarrow R_1 + kR_2 $.\n\nThese operations are crucial for various applications in linear algebra, including finding the inverse of a matrix, determining the rank of a matrix, and solving systems of equations. They preserve the row equivalence of matrices, meaning that the solutions to the corresponding systems of equations remain unchanged after performing these operations.
