    Stationary points are critical points of a function where the derivative is zero or undefined, indicating where the function does not increase or decrease. They are significant for identifying local maxima and minima and assessing function behavior.

    What are stationary points, and how do they relate to derived functions?
answer: >-
    Stationary points are critical points of a function where the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. This occurs at points where the derivative of the function, denoted as \( f'(x) \), is equal to zero or where the derivative is not defined. In essence, stationary points are locations on the graph of the function where the tangent line is horizontal.\n\nTo find stationary points for a single-variable function \( y = f(x) \), you follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Derivative**: Find the derivative \( f'(x) \).\n2. **Set the Derivative to Zero**: Solve the equation \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find the values of $ x $ where the slope of the tangent is zero.\n3. **Check for Undefined Derivatives**: Identify any points where the derivative does not exist, as these can also be stationary points.\n\nFor example, consider the function \( f(x) = x^{2/3} \). To find its stationary points, we first compute the derivative:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \frac{2}{3} x^{-1/3} = \frac{2}{3\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives us no solutions since the expression is undefined at $ x = 0 $. However, $ x = 0 $ is a stationary point because the derivative does not exist there.\n\nThe significance of stationary points lies in their relationship to the behavior of the function. They are often associated with local maxima and minima, which are points where the function reaches a peak or a trough, respectively. To determine whether a stationary point is a maximum, minimum, or neither, one can use the second derivative test or analyze the behavior of the first derivative around the stationary point.\n\nIn summary, stationary points are crucial in calculus for identifying where a function's behavior changes, and they are directly related to the derived function through the condition that the derivative equals zero.
