    How can you determine the rate of change from a given set of data points?
answer: >-
    To determine the rate of change from a given set of data points, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Variables**: Determine which variable is independent (often represented on the x-axis) and which is dependent (often represented on the y-axis). For example, if you are measuring the height of a stack of cups as you add more cups, the number of cups is the independent variable, and the height is the dependent variable.\n\n2. **Select Two Points**: Choose two points from your data set. Each point should be in the form of coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Change in Each Variable**: Compute the change in the dependent variable (y) and the change in the independent variable (x):\n   - Change in y: $\Delta y = y_2 - y_1$\n   - Change in x: $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$\n\n4. **Compute the Rate of Change (Slope)**: The rate of change can be calculated using the formula for the slope $m$:\n   $$\n   m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\n   $$\n   This slope represents the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.\n\n5. **Interpret the Result**: The value of $m$ indicates how much the dependent variable changes for each unit change in the independent variable. For example, if $m = 0.6$ cm per cup, it means that for every additional cup added, the height of the stack increases by 0.6 cm.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have the following data points representing the height of a stack of cups:\n- Point 1: (1 cup, 0.6 cm)\n- Point 2: (2 cups, 1.2 cm)\n\nUsing the steps outlined:\n- Change in y: $\Delta y = 1.2 - 0.6 = 0.6$ cm\n- Change in x: $\Delta x = 2 - 1 = 1$ cup\n- Rate of change (slope): \n$$\nm = \frac{0.6}{1} = 0.6 \text{ cm per cup}\n$$\n\nThis indicates a constant rate of change, which is characteristic of linear relationships. \n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the rate of change from any set of data points, provided they exhibit a linear relationship.
