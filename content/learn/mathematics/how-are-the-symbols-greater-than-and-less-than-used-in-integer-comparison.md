    How are the symbols 'greater than' and 'less than' used in integer comparison?
answer: >-
    In integer comparison, the symbols 'greater than' (>) and 'less than' (<) are used to express the relative size of two integers. These symbols help us determine which integer is larger or smaller when comparing two values.\n\n1. **Greater Than (>)**: This symbol indicates that the integer on the left side is larger than the integer on the right side. For example, if we have the comparison $5 > 3$, it means that 5 is greater than 3.\n\n2. **Less Than (<)**: Conversely, this symbol indicates that the integer on the left side is smaller than the integer on the right side. For instance, in the comparison $-4 < 3$, it signifies that -4 is less than 3.\n\n### Visual Representation on a Number Line\nTo better understand these comparisons, we can visualize integers on a number line. The number line is a straight line where each point corresponds to a real number. In this context:\n- Numbers to the right are greater than those to the left.\n- For example, if we plot -4 and 3 on a number line, 3 will be positioned to the right of -4, confirming that $3 > -4$ and $-4 < 3$.\n\n### Ordering Integers\nWhen ordering integers, we arrange them from left to right in increasing order. For example, if we have the integers -5, 3, and 4, their order from least to greatest would be:\n$$\n-5, 3, 4\n$$\nThis ordering reflects that -5 is the smallest, followed by 3, and then 4, which is the largest.\n\n### Common Mistakes\nIt's important to be cautious when using these symbols, as common mistakes can occur:\n- Confusing the symbols, such as reading $5 < 4$ as "5 is less than 4," which is incorrect.\n- Forgetting to flip the inequality symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.\n\nIn summary, the symbols 'greater than' and 'less than' are fundamental in comparing integers, allowing us to express their relative sizes clearly and accurately.
