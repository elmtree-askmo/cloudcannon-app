    How can you find the minimum value of a quadratic function from its graph?
answer: >-
    To find the minimum value of a quadratic function from its graph, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertex**: The vertex of a quadratic function, which is typically expressed in the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, represents the highest or lowest point of the graph, depending on the direction the parabola opens. If the coefficient $ a $ is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is the minimum point. If $ a $ is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex is the maximum point.\n\n2. **Use the Vertex Formula**: The x-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the quadratic function to find the corresponding y-coordinate, which gives you the minimum value of the function.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation**: On the graph, the vertex will be the point at which the parabola changes direction. For a parabola that opens upwards, this point will be the lowest point on the graph. \n\n4. **Example**: Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1 \). Here, $ a = 2 $ and $ b = -4 $. To find the vertex:\n   - Calculate the x-coordinate:\n     $$\n     x = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4}{4} = 1\n     $$\n   - Substitute $ x = 1 $ back into the function to find the y-coordinate:\n     $$\n     f(1) = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1\n     $$\n   Thus, the minimum value of the function is $-1$ at the vertex point \((1, -1)\).\n\nIn summary, the minimum value of a quadratic function can be found by locating the vertex of the parabola, which can be calculated using the vertex formula and substituting back into the function. The vertex provides both the x-coordinate and the minimum value of the function.
