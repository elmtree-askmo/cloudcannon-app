    In geometry, the basic mathematical operations used include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are essential for manipulating dimensions and calculating various geometric properties. Here are some key applications of these operations in geometry:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are often used to calculate the total lengths or areas. For example, when finding the perimeter of a rectangle, you add the lengths of all sides. The formula for the perimeter $P$ of a rectangle is given by:\n   $$\n   P = 2(l + w)\n   $$\n   where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.\n\n2. **Multiplication**: This operation is frequently used to calculate area and volume. For instance, the area $A$ of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   A = l \times w\n   $$\n   where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width. Similarly, the volume $V$ of a rectangular prism can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   V = l \times w \times h\n   $$\n   where $h$ is the height.\n\n3. **Division**: This operation can be used to find ratios or to distribute lengths or areas evenly. For example, if you want to divide the length of a rectangle into equal parts, you would use division.\n\nThese operations form the foundation for more complex geometric calculations and concepts, allowing for the manipulation and understanding of shapes and their properties.
