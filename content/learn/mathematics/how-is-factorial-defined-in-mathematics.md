    How is factorial defined in mathematics?
answer: >-
    In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer $ n $, denoted by $ n! $, is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $ n $. The formal definition can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nn! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\n$$\n\nFor example, the factorial of 3 is calculated as:\n\n$$\n3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\n$$\n\nAdditionally, by convention, the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1:\n\n$$\n0! = 1\n$$\n\nFactorials are widely used in various areas of mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, where they help in counting arrangements and selections of objects. The factorial function is also essential in probability theory, as it is used to calculate permutations and combinations. \n\nMoreover, the factorial function can be represented recursively as:\n\n$$\nn! = n \times (n - 1)!\n$$\n\nThis recursive definition allows for the computation of factorials in programming and algorithmic contexts. Factorials can also be extended to non-integer values using the gamma function, where \( n! = \Gamma(n + 1) \). \n\nOverall, the factorial function plays a crucial role in many mathematical concepts and applications.
