    How is a function defined in the context of set theory?
answer: >-
    In the context of set theory, a function is formally defined as a specific type of relation between two sets. More precisely, a function $ f $ from a set $ A $ to a set $ B $ (denoted as $ f: A \to B $) assigns to each element $ a \in A $ a unique element $ b \in B $. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nf(a) = b\n$$\n\nfor every $ a \in A $. The set $ A $ is referred to as the domain of the function, while the set $ B $ is called the codomain. The collection of all outputs $ b $ that correspond to elements in $ A $ is known as the range or image of the function, which can be defined as:\n\n$$\n\text{ran } f = \{ b \in B : b = f(a) \text{ for some } a \in A \}\n$$\n\nA key property of functions is that each input from the domain must map to exactly one output in the codomain, ensuring that the function is well-defined. This means that for any $ a_1, a_2 \in A $, if $ a_1 = a_2 $, then \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \).\n\nAdditionally, functions can be classified based on their properties. For example, a function is called "onto" (or surjective) if every element in the codomain $ B $ is the image of at least one element from the domain $ A $. Conversely, a function is "one-to-one" (or injective) if different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain.\n\nIn summary, functions serve as fundamental constructs in set theory, allowing for the systematic study of relationships between sets and the manipulation of mathematical entities.
