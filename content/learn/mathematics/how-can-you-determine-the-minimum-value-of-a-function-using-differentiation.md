    How can you determine the minimum value of a function using differentiation?
answer: >-
    To determine the minimum value of a function using differentiation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the First Derivative**: Start by computing the first derivative of the function \( f(x) \). The first derivative, denoted as \( f'(x) \), represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at any point $ x $.\n\n2. **Set the First Derivative to Zero**: Identify the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 0\n   $$\n   Solve this equation to find the values of $ x $ where the slope of the function is zero. These points are potential candidates for local minima or maxima.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Critical Points**: Once you have the critical points, evaluate the original function \( f(x) \) at these points to find their corresponding function values.\n\n4. **Use the Second Derivative Test**: To classify the critical points, compute the second derivative \( f''(x) \). The second derivative test states:\n   - If \( f''(x) > 0 \) at a critical point, then \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at that point.\n   - If \( f''(x) < 0 \), then \( f(x) \) has a local maximum.\n   - If \( f''(x) = 0 \), the test is inconclusive, and further analysis may be needed.\n\n5. **Consider the Endpoints**: If you are working within a closed interval $[a, b]$, also evaluate the function at the endpoints \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \). The minimum value of the function on the interval will be the smallest value among the critical points and the endpoints.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The minimum value of the function can be determined by comparing the values obtained from the critical points and the endpoints. The smallest of these values will be the minimum value of the function over the specified interval.\n\nThis method is widely used in optimization problems, such as minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency in various applications. By following these steps, you can effectively find the minimum value of a function using differentiation.
