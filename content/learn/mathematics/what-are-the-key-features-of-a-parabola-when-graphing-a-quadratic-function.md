    What are the key features of a parabola when graphing a quadratic function?
answer: >-
    When graphing a quadratic function, which is typically expressed in the standard form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), there are several key features to consider:\n\n1. **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on the direction it opens. The coordinates of the vertex can be found using the formula:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the function to find the y-coordinate.\n\n2. **Axis of Symmetry**: The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line known as the axis of symmetry, which can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   This line passes through the vertex.\n\n3. **Direction of Opening**: The direction in which the parabola opens is determined by the coefficient $ a $:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards.\n   - If $ a < 0 $, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n4. **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. It can be found by evaluating the function at $ x = 0 $:\n   $$\n   y = f(0) = c\n   $$\n   Thus, the y-intercept is at the point \( (0, c) \).\n\n5. **X-Intercepts (Roots)**: The x-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. These can be found by solving the equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ using the quadratic formula:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n   The discriminant $ b^2 - 4ac $ determines the nature of the roots:\n   - If $ b^2 - 4ac > 0 $, there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If $ b^2 - 4ac = 0 $, there is one real root (the vertex touches the x-axis).\n   - If $ b^2 - 4ac < 0 $, there are no real roots (the parabola does not intersect the x-axis).\n\n6. **Width of the Parabola**: The value of $ a $ also affects the width of the parabola. A larger absolute value of $ a $ (e.g., $ |a| > 1 $) results in a narrower parabola, while a smaller absolute value (e.g., $ |a| < 1 $) results in a wider parabola.\n\n7. **End Behavior**: The end behavior of the parabola is determined by the sign of $ a $:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, as $ x $ approaches $ \infty $ or $ -\infty $, \( f(x) \) approaches $ \infty $.\n   - If $ a < 0 $, as $ x $ approaches $ \infty $ or $ -\infty $, \( f(x) \) approaches $ -\infty $.\n\nThese features collectively help in sketching the graph of a quadratic function and understanding its behavior.
