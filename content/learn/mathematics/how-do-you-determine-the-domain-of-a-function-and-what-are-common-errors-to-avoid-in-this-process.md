    To determine the domain of a function, you need to identify the set of input values (usually represented as $ x $) for which the function is defined. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Function**: Different types of functions have different restrictions. For example, rational functions, square roots, and logarithmic functions have specific conditions that must be met.\n\n2. **Check for Denominators**: If the function includes a fraction, set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $ x $. The values that make the denominator zero are excluded from the domain. For example, for the function \( f(x) = \frac{x + 2}{x - 3} \), you would set $ x - 3 = 0 $ to find that $ x = 3 $ is not in the domain.\n\n3. **Check for Even Roots**: If the function contains an even root (like a square root), set the radicand (the expression inside the root) greater than or equal to zero and solve for $ x $. For instance, for \( f(x) = \sqrt{7 - x} \), you would solve $ 7 - x \geq 0 $, leading to $ x \leq 7 $.\n\n4. **Consider Logarithmic Functions**: For logarithmic functions, the argument must be greater than zero. For example, for \( f(x) = \log(x - 1) \), you would require $ x - 1 > 0 $, which gives $ x > 1 $.\n\n5. **Combine Restrictions**: After identifying all restrictions from the above steps, combine them to express the domain. This can often be represented in interval notation.\n\n### Common Errors to Avoid:\n- **Neglecting Restrictions**: One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to consider all possible restrictions on the input values. For example, overlooking a denominator or a square root can lead to an incomplete domain.\n  \n- **Incorrectly Solving Inequalities**: When setting up inequalities (especially for square roots), ensure that you solve them correctly. Missteps in algebra can lead to incorrect domain values.\n\n- **Assuming All Real Numbers**: Not all functions have a domain of all real numbers. Always verify if there are any restrictions based on the function's structure.\n\n- **Ignoring Composite Functions**: When dealing with composite functions, remember to consider the domains of both functions involved. For example, if \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x + 1} \) and \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4}x \), you need to ensure that the output of \( g(x) \) falls within the domain of \( f(x) \).\n\nBy following these steps and being mindful of common errors, you can accurately determine the domain of a function. Understanding the domain is crucial for correctly interpreting the function's behavior and ensuring valid mathematical analysis.
