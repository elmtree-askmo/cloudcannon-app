    What is the derivative of k sin x with respect to x?
answer: >-
    To find the derivative of the function \( f(x) = k \sin x \) with respect to $ x $, we can apply the rule for differentiating a constant multiple of a function. The derivative of $ \sin x $ is known to be $ \cos x $.\n\nUsing the constant multiple rule, we have:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx}(k \sin x) = k \frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = k \cos x.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the derivative of $ k \sin x $ with respect to $ x $ is:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx}(k \sin x) = k \cos x.\n$$\n\nThis result is straightforward and follows directly from the standard derivative rules for trigonometric functions.
