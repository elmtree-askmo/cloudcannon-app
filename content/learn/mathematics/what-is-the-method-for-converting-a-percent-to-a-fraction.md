    What is the method for converting a percent to a fraction?
answer: >-
    To convert a percent to a fraction, you can follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Remove the Percent Sign**: Start by taking the percentage value and removing the '%' symbol. For example, if you have 75%, you would just write 75.\n\n2. **Write as a Fraction**: Place the number you obtained in step 1 over 100. This means you write it as a fraction: \n   $$ \n   \frac{75}{100} \n   $$\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction**: If possible, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms. In the case of $\frac{75}{100}$, both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by 25, resulting in:\n   $$ \n   \frac{3}{4} \n   $$\n\n### Example\nLet's convert 75% to a fraction:\n- Remove the '%' sign: 75\n- Write as a fraction: $\frac{75}{100}$\n- Simplify: $\frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4}$\n\n### Additional Notes\n- If the percentage is a decimal (e.g., 4.5%), you would first convert it to a fraction by writing it as $\frac{4.5}{100}$, and then multiply both the numerator and denominator by 10 for each decimal place to eliminate the decimal, resulting in $\frac{45}{1000}$, which can also be simplified.\n\nThis method provides a clear and systematic approach to converting percentages into fractions.
