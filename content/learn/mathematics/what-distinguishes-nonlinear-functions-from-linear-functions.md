    What distinguishes non-linear functions from linear functions?
answer: >-
    Non-linear functions are distinguished from linear functions primarily by their graphical representation and the behavior of their rates of change. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Graph Shape**:\n   - **Linear Functions**: The graph of a linear function is a straight line. This indicates that the relationship between the independent variable $x$ and the dependent variable $y$ is constant. The general form of a linear function is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n   - **Non-linear Functions**: The graphs of non-linear functions do not form straight lines. Instead, they can exhibit curves, peaks, and troughs. Common types of non-linear functions include quadratic functions (e.g., \(f(x) = x^2\)), exponential functions (e.g., \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\)), and piecewise functions.\n\n2. **Rate of Change**:\n   - **Linear Functions**: The rate of change (slope) is constant across the entire domain. This means that for any two points on the line, the average rate of change is the same, calculated using the formula:\n     $$\n     \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n     $$\n   - **Non-linear Functions**: The rate of change varies depending on the interval chosen. For example, in a quadratic function like \(f(x) = x^2\), the average rate of change will differ over different intervals, illustrating that the slope is not constant. For instance, the average rate of change over the intervals [1, 2] and [2, 3] will yield different results.\n\n3. **Behavior**:\n   - **Linear Functions**: They exhibit uniform behavior, meaning that as $x$ increases or decreases, $y$ changes at a consistent rate.\n   - **Non-linear Functions**: They can exhibit a variety of behaviors, such as increasing or decreasing at varying rates, which can lead to complex dynamics like acceleration or deceleration.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **Linear Function Example**: $y = 2x + 3$ produces a straight line with a constant slope of 2.\n   - **Non-linear Function Example**: $y = x^2$ produces a parabola, where the slope changes as $x$ changes.\n\nIn summary, the primary distinctions between linear and non-linear functions lie in their graphical representation, the constancy of their rates of change, and their overall behavior across different intervals. Understanding these differences is crucial for analyzing and modeling various mathematical and real-world scenarios.
