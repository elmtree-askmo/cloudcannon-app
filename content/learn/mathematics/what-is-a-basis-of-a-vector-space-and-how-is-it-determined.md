    What is a basis of a vector space, and how is it determined?
answer: >-
    A basis of a vector space $ V $ is a set of vectors that satisfies two key properties: they are linearly independent and they span the space. This means that any vector in $ V $ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors, and no basis vector can be represented as a linear combination of the others.\n\n### Determining a Basis\n\nTo determine a basis for a vector space, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vector Space**: Define the vector space $ V $ you are working with. This could be a space like $ \mathbb{R}^n $ or a subspace defined by certain conditions.\n\n2. **Find a Set of Vectors**: Start with a set of vectors that you suspect might form a basis. This could be given vectors or vectors derived from a problem context.\n\n3. **Check for Linear Independence**: Use the definition of linear independence. A set of vectors $ \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\} $ is linearly independent if the only solution to the equation \n\n   $$\n   c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_k v_k = 0\n   $$ \n\n   is the trivial solution where all scalars $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k $ are zero. This can be checked using methods such as row reduction or the determinant of a matrix formed by these vectors.\n\n4. **Check for Spanning**: Ensure that the set of vectors spans the vector space. This means that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. You can verify this by showing that the vectors can generate all possible vectors in the space.\n\n5. **Form the Basis**: If the set of vectors is both linearly independent and spans the vector space, then it forms a basis. If not, you may need to adjust your set by removing dependent vectors or adding more vectors until you achieve a valid basis.\n\n### Example\n\nFor instance, in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, the set \n\n$$\n\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}\n$$ \n\nis a basis because:\n\n- They are linearly independent (no scalar multiples can produce one from the other).\n- They span $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ (any vector in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ can be expressed as a combination of these two vectors).\n\n### Dimension\n\nThe number of vectors in a basis is called the dimension of the vector space. For example, the dimension of $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ is 2, as it can be spanned by two linearly independent vectors.\n\nIn summary, a basis is fundamental in understanding the structure of vector spaces, and determining a basis involves checking for linear independence and spanning properties of a set of vectors.
