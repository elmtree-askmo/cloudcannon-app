    What are the properties of a triangle that can be used to determine its congruence?
answer: >-
    To determine the congruence of triangles, several properties and theorems can be utilized. The key properties that can be used to establish the congruence of triangles include:\n\n1. **Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence Theorem**: If three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This means that if $AB = DE$, $BC = EF$, and $CA = FD$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.\n\n2. **Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence Theorem**: If two sides of one triangle and the included angle are equal to two sides of another triangle and the included angle, then the triangles are congruent. For example, if $AB = DE$, $AC = DF$, and $\angle A = \angle D$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.\n\n3. **Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence Theorem**: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent. For instance, if $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, and $AB = DE$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.\n\n4. **Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence Theorem**: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent. For example, if $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, and $AC = DF$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.\n\n5. **Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem**: This theorem applies specifically to right triangles. If the hypotenuse and one leg of one right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one leg of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n6. **Base Angles Theorem**: In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are congruent. Conversely, if two angles in a triangle are congruent, the sides opposite those angles are also congruent.\n\nThese properties and theorems provide a systematic approach to proving the congruence of triangles by comparing their sides and angles. When using these criteria, it is essential to identify corresponding parts accurately to establish congruence.
