    How do hyperboloids of one sheet and two sheets differ?
answer: >-
    The hyperboloids of one sheet and two sheets are two distinct types of quadric surfaces, and they differ primarily in their equations and geometric properties.\n\n1. **Equations**:\n   - The standard equation for a **hyperboloid of one sheet** is given by:\n     $$\n     \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1\n     $$\n   - In contrast, the equation for a **hyperboloid of two sheets** is:\n     $$\n     -\frac{x^2}{A^2} - \frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1\n     $$\n   The key difference lies in the signs of the terms in the equations. For the hyperboloid of one sheet, the $z^2$ term is negative, while for the hyperboloid of two sheets, the $z^2$ term is positive.\n\n2. **Geometric Properties**:\n   - The **hyperboloid of one sheet** is a connected surface that resembles a "saddle" shape and can be visualized as a surface that extends infinitely in all directions, forming a single continuous piece.\n   - The **hyperboloid of two sheets**, on the other hand, consists of two separate, unconnected parts that look like two paraboloids facing away from each other. This surface is unbounded and extends infinitely in the positive and negative $z$ directions, but there is a gap between the two sheets.\n\n3. **Cross Sections**:\n   - The cross sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet can be ellipses or hyperbolas, depending on the plane of intersection.\n   - For the hyperboloid of two sheets, the cross sections can be ellipses or hyperbolas as well, but they will not intersect, reflecting the two distinct components of the surface.\n\nIn summary, the primary differences between hyperboloids of one sheet and two sheets are their equations, connectivity, and geometric shapes. The hyperboloid of one sheet is a single, continuous surface, while the hyperboloid of two sheets consists of two separate parts.
