    Evaluating powers with both positive and negative integer bases involves understanding how the sign of the base and the exponent affect the result. Here are some examples:\n\n### Positive Integer Base\n1. **Example**: $3^4$\n   - Calculation: $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$\n\n2. **Example**: $5^3$\n   - Calculation: $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$\n\n### Negative Integer Base\n1. **Example**: \((-2)^4\)\n   - Since the exponent is even, the result is positive.\n   - Calculation: \((-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) = 16\)\n\n2. **Example**: \((-3)^3\)\n   - Since the exponent is odd, the result is negative.\n   - Calculation: \((-3) \times (-3) \times (-3) = -27\)\n\n### Without Parentheses\n1. **Example**: $-2^3$\n   - Here, the negative sign is not included in parentheses, so we first evaluate the exponent.\n   - Calculation: \(- (2 \times 2 \times 2) = -8\)\n\n2. **Example**: $-4^2$\n   - Similar to the previous example, the negative sign is not included in parentheses.\n   - Calculation: \(- (4 \times 4) = -16\)\n\n### Summary of Rules\n- A negative base raised to an even power results in a positive number.\n- A negative base raised to an odd power results in a negative number.\n- If the negative sign is not in parentheses, it is treated as a multiplication by -1 after evaluating the exponent.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to evaluate powers with both positive and negative integer bases, highlighting the importance of parentheses in determining the outcome.
