    How does a reflection over the Y-axis affect the coordinates of a point?
answer: >-
    A reflection over the Y-axis affects the coordinates of a point by changing the sign of the x-coordinate while keeping the y-coordinate unchanged. This transformation can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\nIf a point has coordinates \((x, y)\), after reflecting over the Y-axis, the new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\).\n\n### Example:\n- If we take a point at \((3, 5)\), reflecting it over the Y-axis will result in the new coordinates \((-3, 5)\).\n- Similarly, for a point at \((-2, 4)\), the reflection over the Y-axis will yield the coordinates \((2, 4)\).\n\nThis transformation effectively mirrors the point across the Y-axis, resulting in a point that is equidistant from the Y-axis but on the opposite side. The y-coordinate remains the same, indicating that the reflection does not alter the vertical position of the point. \n\n### Summary of Reflection Over the Y-axis:\n- **Operation**: \( (x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y) \)\n- **Effect**: Changes the x-coordinate to its opposite; y-coordinate remains constant. \n\nThis principle is fundamental in understanding geometric transformations and is applicable in various mathematical contexts, including graphing and symmetry analysis.
