    What is the parametric vector form of a solution to a homogeneous system, and how does it express solutions in terms of free variables?
answer: >-
    The parametric vector form of a solution to a homogeneous system is a structured way to express the infinite solutions that arise when there are free variables in the system. A homogeneous equation can be represented in the form $Ax = 0$, where $A$ is a matrix and $x$ is a vector of variables.\n\n### Steps to Derive the Parametric Vector Form\n\n1. **Row Reduction**: Begin by performing row reduction on the augmented matrix associated with the homogeneous system to bring it to row echelon form or reduced row echelon form. This process helps identify pivot columns and free variables.\n\n2. **Identify Free Variables**: Free variables are those variables in the system that can take any value, as they are not constrained by the equations. The number of free variables is determined by the difference between the total number of variables and the rank of the matrix (the number of pivot columns).\n\n3. **Express Basic Variables**: Once the system is in row echelon form, express the basic variables in terms of the free variables. For example, if we have a system with two variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, and $x_2$ is a free variable, we can express $x_1$ in terms of $x_2$.\n\n### Example of Parametric Vector Form\n\nSuppose we have a homogeneous system where after row reduction, we find that:\n\n$$\nx_1 = -2x_2 + 3\n$$\n\nWe can express the solution in parametric vector form as follows:\n\n$$\n\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 \\\nx_2\n\end{pmatrix} = \n\begin{pmatrix}\n3 \\\n0\n\end{pmatrix} + \nx_2 \n\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 \\\n1\n\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nIn this representation, $x_2$ is a free variable that can take any real number value, indicating that there are infinitely many solutions to the homogeneous equation.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe parametric vector form allows us to express the solution set of a homogeneous equation in a structured way, highlighting the role of free variables in determining the nature of the solutions. This method is essential for understanding the structure of the solution set and is widely applicable in linear algebra.
