    How can key features of a function be identified from its graph?
answer: >-
    To identify key features of a function from its graph, you can follow a systematic approach that focuses on various characteristics of the graph. Here are the main features to consider:\n\n### 1. **Shape of the Graph**\n   - The overall shape can indicate the type of function (e.g., linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.). For example, a quadratic function will form a parabola, while a cubic function will have an S-like shape.\n\n### 2. **Intercepts**\n   - **X-Intercepts**: Points where the graph crosses the x-axis (where $ y = 0 $). These can be found by solving the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).\n   - **Y-Intercept**: The point where the graph crosses the y-axis (where $ x = 0 $). This can be found by evaluating \( f(0) \).\n\n### 3. **Vertex**\n   - For quadratic functions, the vertex is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on whether it opens upwards or downwards. The vertex can be found using the formula $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $ for the function in standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $.\n\n### 4. **Symmetry**\n   - Some functions exhibit symmetry. For example, even functions (like $ y = x^2 $) are symmetric about the y-axis, while odd functions (like $ y = x^3 $) are symmetric about the origin.\n\n### 5. **Asymptotes**\n   - For rational and exponential functions, look for horizontal or vertical asymptotes. A horizontal asymptote indicates the value that the function approaches as $ x $ approaches infinity, while a vertical asymptote indicates values of $ x $ that the function cannot take.\n\n### 6. **Increasing and Decreasing Intervals**\n   - Identify intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing. This can be determined by analyzing the slope of the graph. For example, if the graph rises as you move from left to right, the function is increasing in that interval.\n\n### 7. **End Behavior**\n   - Analyze how the function behaves as $ x $ approaches positive or negative infinity. This can provide insights into the long-term behavior of the function.\n\n### 8. **Local Maxima and Minima**\n   - Identify any local maximum or minimum points, which are points where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. These points can be found using calculus or by observing the graph.\n\n### 9. **Continuity and Discontinuity**\n   - Check if the graph is continuous or if there are any breaks, jumps, or holes. Discontinuities can indicate points where the function is not defined.\n\n### 10. **Transformations**\n   - If the function has been transformed (e.g., shifted, stretched, or reflected), note these changes. For example, a function \( f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 3 \) is a transformation of the basic quadratic function $ y = x^2 $ that shifts it 2 units to the right and 3 units up.\n\nBy analyzing these features, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior and properties, which is essential for function analysis and graph interpretation.
