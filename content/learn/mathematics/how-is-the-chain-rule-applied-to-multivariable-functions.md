answer: >-
    The chain rule for multivariable functions is an extension of the chain rule from single-variable calculus, allowing us to differentiate compositions of functions that depend on multiple variables. This rule is particularly useful when dealing with functions where the independent variables themselves are functions of other variables.\n\n### Basic Concept\n\nIn single-variable calculus, the chain rule states that if you have a function \(y = f(g(x))\), the derivative is given by:\n\n$$\n\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).\n$$\n\nFor multivariable functions, the chain rule incorporates partial derivatives. If you have a function \(z = f(x, y)\) where both $x$ and $y$ are functions of another variable $t$ (i.e., \(x = g(t)\) and \(y = h(t)\)), the derivative of $z$ with respect to $t$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt}.\n$$\n\n### Application\n\nTo apply the multivariable chain rule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the dependent and independent variables**: Determine which variables are dependent on others.\n2. **Compute the partial derivatives**: Find the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable.\n3. **Differentiate the independent variables**: Compute the derivatives of the independent variables with respect to the variable of interest.\n4. **Combine using the chain rule**: Use the formula above to combine the results.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the function \(z = f(x, y) = 3x^2 - y^2\) where \(x = g(t) = t^2\) and \(y = h(t) = 2t\). To find $\frac{dz}{dt}$:\n\n1. Compute the partial derivatives:\n   - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 6x$\n   - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y$\n\n2. Differentiate the independent variables:\n   - $\frac{dx}{dt} = 2t$\n   - $\frac{dy}{dt} = 2$\n\n3. Substitute into the chain rule formula:\n   - $\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt}$\n   - \(\frac{dz}{dt} = (6x)(2t) + (-2y)(2)\)\n\n4. Substitute $x$ and $y$ with their expressions in terms of $t$:\n   - \(\frac{dz}{dt} = (6(t^2))(2t) + (-2(2t))(2)\)\n   - Simplifying gives the final result.\n\nThis method allows for the differentiation of complex functions that depend on multiple variables, making it a powerful tool in multivariable calculus.
