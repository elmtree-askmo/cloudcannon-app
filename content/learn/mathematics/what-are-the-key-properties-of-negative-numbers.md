    What are the key properties of negative numbers?
answer: >-
    Negative numbers possess several key properties that are important in mathematics. Here are the main characteristics:\n\n1. **Definition**: A negative number is any number that is less than zero. It is represented with a minus sign (-) in front of it. For example, -1, -5, and -15 are all negative numbers.\n\n2. **Position on the Number Line**: On a number line, negative numbers are located to the left of zero. This positioning indicates that they represent values that are less than zero.\n\n3. **Types of Negative Numbers**: Negative numbers can be integers (like -1, -2, -3), fractions (like -1/2, -3/4), or decimals (like -0.5, -2.75). This means that negative numbers are not limited to whole numbers; they can also be expressed in various forms.\n\n4. **Real Numbers**: Negative numbers are classified as real numbers, which include all rational and irrational numbers. This classification allows them to be used in various mathematical operations and contexts.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - **Addition**: Adding a negative number to a positive number results in a smaller positive number or a negative number. For example, \(5 + (-3) = 2\).\n   - **Subtraction**: Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. For example, \(5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8\).\n   - **Multiplication**: The product of a negative number and a positive number is negative. The product of two negative numbers is positive. For example, \((-2) \times 3 = -6\) and \((-2) \times (-3) = 6\).\n   - **Division**: Similar to multiplication, dividing a negative number by a positive number results in a negative quotient, while dividing two negative numbers results in a positive quotient.\n\n6. **Absolute Value**: The absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart. For example, the absolute value of -5 is 5, denoted as $|-5| = 5$.\n\n7. **Use in Real-Life Contexts**: Negative numbers are often used to represent values such as debts, temperatures below zero, and losses in various fields, including finance and science.\n\nThese properties highlight the significance of negative numbers in mathematics and their application in real-world scenarios.
