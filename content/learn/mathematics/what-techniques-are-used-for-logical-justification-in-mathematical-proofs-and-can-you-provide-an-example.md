    Logical justification in mathematical proofs involves various techniques that ensure each step in an argument follows logically from the previous steps. Here are some common techniques used for logical justification:\n\n1. **Direct Proof**: This method involves straightforward logical deductions from known facts or axioms to establish the truth of a statement. For example, to prove that the sum of two even numbers is even, one can express even numbers as $2m$ and $2n$ (where $m$ and $n$ are integers) and show that $2m + 2n = 2(m+n)$, which is also even.\n\n2. **Proof by Contradiction**: In this technique, one assumes the opposite of what is to be proven and shows that this assumption leads to a contradiction. For instance, to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, one can assume that it is rational (i.e., can be expressed as a fraction) and derive a contradiction regarding the parity of integers.\n\n3. **Proof by Contrapositive**: This method involves proving that if the conclusion is false, then the premise must also be false. For example, to prove that if $x$ is not even, then $x^2$ is not even, one can show that if $x^2$ is even, then $x$ must be even.\n\n4. **Mathematical Induction**: This technique is particularly useful for proving statements about natural numbers. It consists of two steps: the base case (proving the statement for the initial value, usually $n=1$) and the inductive step (assuming the statement holds for $n=k$ and proving it for $n=k+1$).\n\n5. **Strong Induction**: Similar to mathematical induction, but in the inductive step, one assumes the statement is true for all values up to $k$ to prove it for $k+1$. This is useful for statements that depend on multiple previous cases.\n\n### Example of a Proof by Induction\n\nLet's prove that the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nS(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\n\n**Base Case**: For $n=1$,\n$$\nS(1) = 1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1.\n$$\nThe base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step**: Assume the formula holds for some integer $k$, i.e.,\n$$\nS(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\n$$\nNow, we need to prove it for $k+1$:\n$$\nS(k+1) = S(k) + (k+1).\n$$\nSubstituting the inductive hypothesis:\n$$\nS(k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}.\n$$\nThus, the formula holds for $k+1$.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the formula is true for all natural numbers $n$.\n\nIn summary, logical justification in mathematical proofs employs various techniques, each suited to different types of statements, ensuring that conclusions are rigorously supported by premises.
