    What is the distance formula and how is it derived?
answer: >-
    The distance formula is a mathematical equation used to calculate the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. Given two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), the distance $ d $ is expressed as:\n\n$$\nd = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Distance Formula\n\nThe distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nTo understand this derivation, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Points**: Let point $ A $ be \( (x_1, y_1) \) and point $ B $ be \( (x_2, y_2) \).\n\n2. **Form a Right Triangle**: When these two points are plotted on a Cartesian plane, they can be connected to form a right triangle:\n   - The horizontal leg of the triangle corresponds to the difference in the x-coordinates: $ |x_2 - x_1| $.\n   - The vertical leg of the triangle corresponds to the difference in the y-coordinates: $ |y_2 - y_1| $.\n\n3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the triangle can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\n   $$\n   where $ d $ is the length of the hypotenuse (the distance between points A and B).\n\n4. **Solve for Distance**: To find the distance $ d $, take the square root of both sides:\n   $$\n   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nTo illustrate the use of the distance formula, consider finding the distance between the points \( (1, 2) \) and \( (4, 6) \):\n\n1. Identify the coordinates:\n   - \( (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2) \)\n   - \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, 6) \)\n\n2. Substitute into the distance formula:\n   $$\n   d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\n   $$\n\nThus, the distance between the two points is 5 units.\n\nIn summary, the distance formula is a crucial tool in geometry and coordinate systems, allowing for the calculation of distances between points based on their coordinates.
