    When converting units, when should you move the decimal point to the right?
answer: >-
    When converting units in the metric system, you should move the decimal point to the right when converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit. This is because smaller units represent a greater quantity of the measurement, thus requiring an increase in the numerical value.\n\n### Key Points on Decimal Point Movement:\n1. **Larger to Smaller Units**: Move the decimal point to the right.\n   - **Example**: Converting 7 meters to centimeters involves moving the decimal point two places to the right, resulting in 700 centimeters.\n   \n2. **Smaller to Larger Units**: Move the decimal point to the left.\n   - **Example**: Converting 30,000 milligrams to grams requires moving the decimal point three places to the left, resulting in 30 grams.\n\n### Conversion Process:\nTo effectively convert between metric units:\n1. Identify the starting unit and the desired unit.\n2. Use the metric number line to count the steps between the two units.\n3. Move the decimal point in the original number according to the number of steps counted:\n   - **Right** for smaller prefixes (decreasing the value).\n   - **Left** for larger prefixes (increasing the value).\n\n### Visual Representation:\nThe metric number line helps visualize the relationship between units:\n- **Larger Units**: kilo (k), hecto (h), deca (da)\n- **Base Unit**: meter (m), liter (L), gram (g)\n- **Smaller Units**: deci (d), centi (c), milli (m)\n\nFor example, the conversion from liters to milliliters involves moving three places to the right on the number line, which means you multiply the number of liters by 1,000 (since 1 liter = 1,000 milliliters).\n\nIn summary, remember to move the decimal point to the right when converting from larger to smaller metric units to accurately reflect the increased quantity.
