    How is the integral of a vector function of a real variable defined?
answer: >-
    The integral of a vector function of a real variable is defined similarly to the integral of a real-valued function, but it involves integrating each component of the vector function separately. \n\nFor a vector-valued function \(\vec{r}(t)\) expressed in terms of its components as:\n\n$$\n\vec{r}(t) = f(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}} + g(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}} + h(t) \hat{\mathbf{k}},\n$$\n\nthe indefinite integral is given by:\n\n$$\n\int \vec{r}(t) \, dt = \int [f(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}} + g(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}} + h(t) \hat{\mathbf{k}}] \, dt = \left[ \int f(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \left[ \int g(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \left[ \int h(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{k}}.\n$$\n\nFor the definite integral over an interval $[a, b]$, it is computed as:\n\n$$\n\int_a^b \vec{r}(t) \, dt = \int_a^b [f(t) \hat{\mathbf{i}} + g(t) \hat{\mathbf{j}} + h(t) \hat{\mathbf{k}}] \, dt = \left[\int_a^b f(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \left[\int_a^b g(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \left[\int_a^b h(t) \, dt \right] \hat{\mathbf{k}}.\n$$\n\nThis approach ensures that the integral of the vector function retains its vector nature, with each component being integrated independently. The result of the indefinite integral is a vector function, while the definite integral yields a single vector that represents the net change over the specified interval. \n\nIntegrals of vector-valued functions are particularly useful in physics and engineering, where they can represent quantities such as displacement, velocity, and force.
