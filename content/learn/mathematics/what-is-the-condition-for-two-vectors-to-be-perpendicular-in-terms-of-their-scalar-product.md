    What is the condition for two vectors to be perpendicular in terms of their scalar product?
answer: >-
    The condition for two vectors to be perpendicular, also known as orthogonal, is that their scalar product (or dot product) must equal zero. Mathematically, if you have two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, they are perpendicular if:\n\n$$\n\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = 0\n$$\n\nThis property is significant in both geometry and physics, as it indicates that the vectors form a right angle (90 degrees) with each other. The dot product provides a straightforward method to determine the relationship between two vectors, allowing you to easily check for perpendicularity by calculating their scalar product. If the result is zero, the vectors are confirmed to be perpendicular.
