    How does the orientation of a triangle change when it is reflected over the X-axis?
answer: >-
    When a triangle is reflected over the X-axis, the orientation of the triangle changes, but its shape and size remain the same. This transformation involves flipping the triangle across the X-axis, which affects the y-coordinates of its vertices.\n\nFor example, consider a triangle with vertices at the following coordinates:\n- A(2, 4)\n- B(3, 3)\n- C(1, 3)\n\nWhen this triangle is reflected over the X-axis, the new coordinates of the vertices will be:\n- A'(2, -4)\n- B'(3, -3)\n- C'(1, -3)\n\nAs you can see, the x-coordinates remain unchanged, while the y-coordinates are inverted (i.e., they change to their opposites). This results in the triangle being flipped vertically, which alters its orientation. \n\nIn summary, reflecting a triangle over the X-axis results in:\n- The same shape and size.\n- The x-coordinates of the vertices remain the same.\n- The y-coordinates of the vertices change to their opposites, leading to a change in orientation. \n\nThis principle applies universally to all geometric figures reflected across the X-axis.
