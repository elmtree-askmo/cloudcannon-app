    What are the properties and equations of conic sections like circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas?
answer: >-
    Conic sections are curves obtained by the intersection of a plane with a double-napped cone. They include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, each with distinct properties and equations. Hereâ€™s an overview of each type:\n\n### 1. Circle\n- **Definition**: A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center.\n- **Standard Equation**: If the center is at the origin (0, 0) and the radius is $ r $, the equation is:\n  $$\n  x^2 + y^2 = r^2\n  $$\n- **Properties**: \n  - Eccentricity $ e = 0 $\n  - All points are equidistant from the center.\n\n### 2. Ellipse\n- **Definition**: An ellipse is the set of all points where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant.\n- **Standard Equation**: If the center is at the origin, the equation is:\n  $$\n  \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\n  $$\n  where $ a $ and $ b $ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.\n- **Properties**:\n  - Eccentricity $ e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}} $ (where $ a > b $)\n  - Has two foci located along the major axis.\n\n### 3. Parabola\n- **Definition**: A parabola is the set of all points that are equidistant from a fixed point (focus) and a fixed line (directrix).\n- **Standard Equation**: If the vertex is at the origin and opens to the right, the equation is:\n  $$\n  y^2 = 4px\n  $$\n  where $ p $ is the distance from the vertex to the focus.\n- **Properties**:\n  - Eccentricity $ e = 1 $\n  - Has one focus and one directrix.\n\n### 4. Hyperbola\n- **Definition**: A hyperbola consists of two separate curves (branches) where the difference of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant.\n- **Standard Equation**: If the center is at the origin, the equation is:\n  $$\n  \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\n  $$\n- **Properties**:\n  - Eccentricity $ e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}} $ (where $ a $ and $ b $ are the distances related to the axes)\n  - Has two foci and two asymptotes.\n\n### General Equation of Conic Sections\nThe general form of a conic section can be expressed as:\n$$\nAx^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n$$\nwhere the values of $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ determine the type of conic section.\n\n### Summary\nConic sections are fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, and architecture, due to their unique properties and applications. Understanding their equations and characteristics is essential for solving problems related to geometry and algebra.
