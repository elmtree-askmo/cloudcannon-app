    To convert fractional exponents to radical expressions, you can follow a straightforward process based on the relationship between exponents and roots. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractional Exponents**: A fractional exponent is expressed in the form $ x^{\frac{m}{n}} $, where $ m $ is the numerator and $ n $ is the denominator. This notation indicates that $ x $ is raised to the power of $ m $ and then the $ n $-th root is taken.\n\n2. **Conversion to Radical Form**: To convert the fractional exponent $ x^{\frac{m}{n}} $ into a radical expression, you can use the following steps:\n   - The denominator $ n $ of the fractional exponent becomes the index of the radical.\n   - The numerator $ m $ becomes the exponent of the radicand (the expression inside the radical).\n\n   Therefore, the conversion can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   x^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x^m}\n   $$\n\n3. **Example Conversions**:\n   - For $ x^{\frac{1}{2}} $: This can be converted to $ \sqrt{x} $ since the denominator is 2 (indicating a square root).\n   - For $ x^{\frac{3}{4}} $: This converts to $ \sqrt[4]{x^3} $, where 4 is the index of the radical and $ x^3 $ is the radicand.\n\n4. **General Rule**: The general rule for converting a fractional exponent to a radical is:\n   - If you have $ x^{\frac{1}{n}} $, it becomes $ \sqrt[n]{x} $.\n   - If you have $ x^{\frac{m}{n}} $, it becomes $ \sqrt[n]{x^m} $.\n\n5. **Creating the Expression**: You can create the radical expression by first identifying the denominator (which becomes the index) and then the numerator (which becomes the exponent of the radicand). This can be done in either order, and you will arrive at the correct radical expression.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively convert any fractional exponent into its corresponding radical expression. This understanding is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations involving exponents and radicals.
