    The inverse of a function is defined as a function that undoes the action of the original function, requiring the original function to be one-to-one. This concept involves understanding domains and ranges, finding inverses through algebraic manipulation, and recognizing functions that do not have inverses.

    What is the definition of the inverse of a function?
answer: >-
    The inverse of a function is a function that "undoes" the action of the original function. If we have a function $ f $ that maps an input $ x $ to an output $ y $ (i.e., \( y = f(x) \)), then the inverse function, denoted as $ f^{-1} $, will map $ y $ back to $ x $ (i.e., \( x = f^{-1}(y) \)). \n\nFor a function to have an inverse, it must be a one-to-one function (injective), meaning that each output is produced by exactly one input. This ensures that the inverse function is also well-defined. The domain of the inverse function $ f^{-1} $ is the range of the original function $ f $, and the range of $ f^{-1} $ is the domain of $ f $.\n\nTo find the inverse of a function, you typically follow these steps:\n1. Replace \( f(x) \) with $ y $.\n2. Swap $ x $ and $ y $.\n3. Solve for $ y $ to express it in terms of $ x $.\n4. Replace $ y $ with \( f^{-1}(x) \).\n\nFor example, consider the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \):\n1. Set $ y = 2x + 3 $.\n2. Swap $ x $ and $ y $: $ x = 2y + 3 $.\n3. Solve for $ y $: $ y = \frac{x - 3}{2} $.\n4. Thus, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2} \).\n\nIt is also important to note that not all functions have inverses. For instance, the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) does not have an inverse over all real numbers because it is not one-to-one; both $ x $ and $ -x $ yield the same output for positive $ x $. However, if we restrict the domain to non-negative numbers (i.e., $ x \geq 0 $), then the inverse can be defined as \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \).\n\nIn summary, the inverse of a function is a fundamental concept in mathematics that allows us to reverse the mapping of inputs and outputs, provided the original function is one-to-one.
