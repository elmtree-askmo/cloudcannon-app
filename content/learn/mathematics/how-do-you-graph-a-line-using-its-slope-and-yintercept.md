    How do you graph a line using its slope and y-intercept?
answer: >-
    To graph a line using its slope and y-intercept, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Slope and Y-Intercept**: Start with the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, which is given by:\n   $$\n   y = mx + b\n   $$\n   Here, $m$ represents the slope of the line, and $b$ represents the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Plot the Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This occurs when $x = 0$. For example, if the equation is $y = 2x + 3$, the y-intercept is $3$, so you would plot the point \((0, 3)\) on the graph.\n\n3. **Use the Slope to Find Another Point**: The slope $m$ indicates how much $y$ changes for a unit change in $x$. It is expressed as a ratio of the rise (change in $y$) over the run (change in $x$). For instance, if the slope is $2$ (which can be written as $\frac{2}{1}$), it means that for every 1 unit you move to the right (increase in $x$), you move up 2 units (increase in $y$). From the y-intercept point \((0, 3)\), you would move right 1 unit to $x = 1$ and up 2 units to $y = 5$, giving you the point \((1, 5)\).\n\n4. **Plot the Second Point**: After calculating the second point using the slope, plot this point on the graph.\n\n5. **Draw the Line**: Connect the two points with a straight line, extending it in both directions. Make sure to use arrows at both ends to indicate that the line continues indefinitely.\n\n### Example:\nFor the equation $y = 2x + 1$:\n- The y-intercept $b$ is $1$, so plot the point \((0, 1)\).\n- The slope $m$ is $2$, so from \((0, 1)\), move right 1 unit to $x = 1$ and up 2 units to $y = 3$, giving the point \((1, 3)\).\n- Plot \((1, 3)\) and draw a line through \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 3)\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately graph a line using its slope and y-intercept.
