    This scenario illustrates the application of strong induction in proving properties of the Fibonacci sequence where the next case depends on multiple previous cases, specifically in proving that Fibonacci numbers are less than or equal to powers of 2.

    Describe a scenario where strong induction is more applicable than simple induction.
answer: >-
    Strong induction is particularly useful in scenarios where the proof of a statement for a natural number $ n+1 $ relies on the truth of the statement for multiple preceding values, rather than just the immediate predecessor $ n $. \n\n### Scenario Example: Fibonacci Numbers\n\nConsider the Fibonacci sequence defined as follows:\n- $ F_0 = 0 $\n- $ F_1 = 1 $\n- $ F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $ for $ n \geq 2 $\n\nSuppose we want to prove that $ F_n $ is less than or equal to $ 2^n $ for all $ n \geq 0 $. \n\n#### Base Case:\nFor $ n = 0 $:\n$$\nF_0 = 0 \leq 2^0 = 1\n$$\nFor $ n = 1 $:\n$$\nF_1 = 1 \leq 2^1 = 2\n$$\nFor $ n = 2 $:\n$$\nF_2 = 1 \leq 2^2 = 4\n$$\n\n#### Inductive Step:\nNow, we assume that the statement holds for all integers $ k $ such that $ 0 \leq k \leq n $ (this is where strong induction comes into play). That is, we assume:\n$$\nF_k \leq 2^k \quad \text{for all } k \text{ such that } 0 \leq k \leq n\n$$\n\nWe need to show that:\n$$\nF_{n+1} \leq 2^{n+1}\n$$\n\nUsing the Fibonacci definition:\n$$\nF_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}\n$$\n\nBy the inductive hypothesis:\n$$\nF_n \leq 2^n \quad \text{and} \quad F_{n-1} \leq 2^{n-1}\n$$\n\nThus:\n$$\nF_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} \leq 2^n + 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}(2 + 1) = 2^{n-1} \cdot 3\n$$\n\nNow, we need to show that:\n$$\n2^{n-1} \cdot 3 \leq 2^{n+1}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n3 \leq 4\n$$\nwhich is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn this scenario, strong induction is more applicable than simple induction because the proof for $ F_{n+1} $ relies on both $ F_n $ and $ F_{n-1} $. If we were to use simple induction, we would not have the necessary information from $ F_{n-1} $ to complete the proof, demonstrating the strength and utility of strong induction in cases where multiple previous cases are needed to establish the next case.
