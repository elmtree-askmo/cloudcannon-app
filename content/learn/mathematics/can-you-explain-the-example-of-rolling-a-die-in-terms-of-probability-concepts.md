answer: >-
    Rolling a die is a fundamental example used in probability theory to illustrate basic concepts. A standard die is a cube with six faces, each marked with a number from 1 to 6. When you roll a fair die, each face has an equal probability of landing face up, which is calculated as follows:\n\nThe probability $ P $ of rolling any specific number (for example, a 3) is given by:\n\n$$\nP(3) = \frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\nThis is because there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of a total of six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n### Basic Outcomes\nWhen rolling two dice, the situation becomes slightly more complex. The basic outcome of rolling two dice is represented as an ordered pair (Die #1, Die #2). For example, if Die #1 shows a 3 and Die #2 shows a 6, the outcome is (3, 6). The total number of outcomes when rolling two dice is $ 6 \times 6 = 36 $.\n\n### Probability of Specific Events\nTo find the probability of rolling a specific sum, such as 10, you would list all the combinations of the two dice that add up to 10. The combinations are (4, 6), (5, 5), and (6, 4). There are three favorable outcomes for this event, so the probability of rolling a sum of 10 is:\n\n$$\nP(\text{sum} = 10) = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\n### Probability of Rolling Odd Numbers\nIf you want to calculate the probability of rolling an odd number on a single die, the odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. There are three favorable outcomes, so the probability is:\n\n$$\nP(\text{odd}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nRolling a die serves as a clear and straightforward example to understand the principles of probability, including sample spaces, events, and the calculation of probabilities for various outcomes. This foundational concept is widely applicable in various fields, including statistics, gaming, and decision-making processes.
