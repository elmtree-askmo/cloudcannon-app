    Describe the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.
answer: >-
    The difference between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations primarily lies in the direction of the rotation relative to a fixed point, typically the origin in a coordinate plane.\n\n1. **Clockwise Rotation**:\n   - Clockwise (abbreviated as CW) refers to a circular motion that follows the same direction as the hands of a clock. \n   - When rotating a figure or point clockwise, the motion starts from the top position, moves to the right, continues to the bottom, then to the left, and finally returns to the top position.\n   - In mathematical terms, a clockwise rotation is often represented with negative angles. For example, a 90-degree clockwise rotation can be represented as a -90-degree rotation.\n\n2. **Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n   - Counterclockwise (abbreviated as CCW) signifies a motion that goes in the opposite direction of the clock's hands. \n   - In this case, the rotation starts from the top position, moves to the left, continues to the bottom, then to the right, and back to the top.\n   - Counterclockwise rotations are typically represented with positive angles. For instance, a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation is simply a +90-degree rotation.\n\n### Summary of Key Points:\n- **Direction**: \n  - Clockwise: Rightward from the top (CW).\n  - Counterclockwise: Leftward from the top (CCW).\n  \n- **Angle Representation**:\n  - Clockwise: Negative angles (e.g., -90 degrees).\n  - Counterclockwise: Positive angles (e.g., +90 degrees).\n\n- **Applications**: \n  - Clockwise rotations are commonly used in practical applications like tightening screws or closing faucets, while counterclockwise rotations are often used in mathematical contexts to define angles and transformations.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial in geometry, particularly when performing transformations on geometric figures in the coordinate plane.
