    How do you determine the slope of a line from a graph?
answer: >-
    To determine the slope of a line from a graph, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select Two Points**: Choose any two distinct points on the line. It is important to ensure that these points are clearly identifiable on the graph. Let's denote these points as \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \).\n\n2. **Record Coordinates**: Write down the coordinates of the two points. For example, if you choose points A and B, you might have \( A = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( B = (x_2, y_2) \).\n\n3. **Calculate the Rise**: The rise is the difference in the y-coordinates of the two points. This can be calculated as:\n   $$ \text{Rise} = y_2 - y_1 $$\n\n4. **Calculate the Run**: The run is the difference in the x-coordinates of the two points. This can be calculated as:\n   $$ \text{Run} = x_2 - x_1 $$\n\n5. **Determine the Slope**: The slope $ m $ of the line is given by the formula:\n   $$ m = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\n\n6. **Interpret the Slope**: If the slope is positive, the line rises as it moves to the right. If the slope is negative, the line falls as it moves to the right. A slope of zero indicates a horizontal line, while an undefined slope indicates a vertical line.\n\nFor example, if you select points \( (2, 3) \) and \( (5, 7) \), the calculations would be:\n- Rise: $ 7 - 3 = 4 $\n- Run: $ 5 - 2 = 3 $\n- Slope: $ m = \frac{4}{3} $\n\nThis method provides a straightforward way to calculate the slope of a line from a graph, which is a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry.
