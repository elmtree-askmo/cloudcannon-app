    What are the key components of a recurrence relation?
answer: >-
    The key components of a recurrence relation include:\n\n1. **Recurrence Formula**: This is the equation that defines the relationship between the terms of the sequence. It expresses the next term in the sequence as a function of one or more of the preceding terms. For example, in the relation defined by $ u_{n+1} = 3u_n + 5 $, the next term $ u_{n+1} $ is calculated using the current term $ u_n $.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**: These are the starting values needed to begin the sequence. For instance, in the Fibonacci sequence defined by $ F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $, the initial conditions are $ F_0 = 0 $ and $ F_1 = 1 $. Without these initial conditions, the recurrence relation cannot generate the sequence.\n\n3. **Terms of the Sequence**: The terms of the sequence are typically denoted as $ u_n $ (the current term), $ u_{n-1} $ (the previous term), and $ u_{n+1} $ (the next term). The notation helps in understanding the progression of the sequence.\n\n4. **Base Case**: This is a specific case that does not rely on the recurrence relation itself. It serves as a stopping point for the recursive process. For example, in the factorial function defined recursively, the base case is $ 0! = 1 $.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: This part of the relation defines how to compute the next term based on previous terms. It breaks down the problem into smaller instances, allowing for the calculation of terms in a sequence.\n\n6. **Domain**: The domain of the recurrence relation specifies the values of $ n $ for which the relation is defined. This is important for understanding the limits of the sequence.\n\nIn summary, a recurrence relation is characterized by its recurrence formula, initial conditions, terms of the sequence, base case, recursive case, and domain. These components work together to define and generate a sequence of values based on previous terms.
