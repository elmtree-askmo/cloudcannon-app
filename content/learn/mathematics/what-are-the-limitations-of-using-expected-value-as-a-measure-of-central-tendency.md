    What are the limitations of using expected value as a measure of central tendency?
answer: >-
    The expected value (EV) is a widely used measure of central tendency in statistics and probability, representing the average outcome of a random variable over a large number of trials. However, it has several limitations that can affect its effectiveness as a measure of central tendency:\n\n1. **Assumption of Independence and Identical Distribution**: The expected value is based on the assumption that all outcomes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). If this assumption does not hold, the expected value may not accurately reflect the central tendency of the data.\n\n2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**: The expected value can be heavily influenced by extreme values or outliers in the dataset. For example, in a dataset where most values are clustered around a certain point but a few values are significantly higher or lower, the expected value may not represent the "typical" outcome effectively. In such cases, the median or mode may provide a better measure of central tendency.\n\n3. **Non-Normal Distributions**: In distributions that are skewed or have heavy tails, the expected value may not be a good representation of the center of the distribution. For instance, in a right-skewed distribution, the mean (expected value) will be greater than the median, which may mislead interpretations of the data.\n\n4. **Lack of Context**: The expected value provides a single summary number but does not convey information about the variability or spread of the data. Two distributions can have the same expected value but differ significantly in their spread, which can lead to different interpretations of risk and uncertainty.\n\n5. **Interpretation Challenges**: In some contexts, the expected value may not have a clear or intuitive interpretation. For example, in decision-making scenarios involving risk, relying solely on expected value can lead to suboptimal choices if the decision-maker does not consider the probabilities and potential outcomes adequately.\n\nIn summary, while the expected value is a useful statistical measure, it is important to consider its limitations and the context of the data when interpreting results. In many cases, alternative measures of central tendency, such as the median or mode, may provide more meaningful insights, especially in the presence of skewed distributions or outliers.
