    What does it mean for a function to be continuous?
answer: >-
    A function is considered continuous if it can be graphed without any breaks, jumps, or holes. This means that for every point in the function's domain, the function's value is defined and matches the limit of the function as it approaches that point. \n\nMathematically, a function \( f(x) \) is continuous at a point $ x = a $ if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. The function \( f(a) \) is defined.\n2. The limit of \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches $ a $ exists, which can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \text{ exists.}\n   $$\n3. The limit of \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches $ a $ is equal to the function value at that point:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).\n   $$\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, the function is considered discontinuous at that point. \n\nIn practical terms, if you can draw the graph of the function without lifting your pen from the paper, then the function is continuous. This concept is fundamental in calculus, as continuity is essential for understanding limits, derivatives, and integrals. \n\nIn summary, continuity ensures that a function behaves predictably and smoothly over its domain, which is crucial for many mathematical applications.
