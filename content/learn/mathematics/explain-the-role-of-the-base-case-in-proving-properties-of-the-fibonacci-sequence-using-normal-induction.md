    Explain the role of the base case in proving properties of the Fibonacci sequence using normal induction.
answer: >-
    In proving properties of the Fibonacci sequence using normal induction, the base case plays a crucial role. The base case serves as the foundation for the entire inductive proof, establishing that the property holds for the initial value(s) of the sequence.\n\nFor example, consider a property \( P(n) \) that we want to prove for all integers $ n \geq 1 $. The base case typically involves verifying that \( P(1) \) is true. In the context of the Fibonacci sequence, we can state that:\n\n1. The first Fibonacci number is $ F_1 = 1 $.\n2. If our property \( P(n) \) asserts something about the Fibonacci numbers, we need to show that it holds for $ n = 1 $.\n\nOnce we establish that \( P(1) \) is true, we proceed to the inductive step. This step involves assuming that \( P(k) \) is true for some arbitrary integer $ k $ (the induction hypothesis) and then proving that \( P(k+1) \) must also be true based on this assumption.\n\nThe importance of the base case can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Foundation for Induction**: The base case confirms that the property holds for the starting point of the sequence. Without a valid base case, the inductive argument cannot be initiated.\n- **Ensures Validity**: It ensures that the property is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to the first element(s) of the sequence.\n- **Inductive Chain**: The base case is the first link in the chain of reasoning that allows us to extend the truth of the property to all subsequent integers.\n\nIn summary, the base case is essential in proving properties of the Fibonacci sequence using normal induction, as it validates the starting point of the induction process and ensures that the property can be extended to all integers in the sequence.
