    How can strong induction be used to prove properties of the Fibonacci sequence?
answer: >-
    Strong induction can be effectively used to prove properties of the Fibonacci sequence due to its recursive nature. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- $ F_1 = 1 $\n- $ F_2 = 1 $\n- $ F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} $ for all $ n \geq 2 $\n\n### Steps to Prove a Property Using Strong Induction\n\n1. **Identify the Property to Prove**: Let's say we want to prove that for all $ n \geq 1 $, $ F_n < 2^n $.\n\n2. **Base Cases**: We need to verify the property for the initial values of $ n $:\n   - For $ n = 1 $: $ F_1 = 1 < 2^1 = 2 $ (True)\n   - For $ n = 2 $: $ F_2 = 1 < 2^2 = 4 $ (True)\n   - For $ n = 3 $: $ F_3 = 2 < 2^3 = 8 $ (True)\n   - For $ n = 4 $: $ F_4 = 3 < 2^4 = 16 $ (True)\n   - For $ n = 5 $: $ F_5 = 5 < 2^5 = 32 $ (True)\n\n   Thus, the base cases hold for $ n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 $.\n\n3. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the property holds for all integers $ k $ such that $ 1 \leq k \leq n $. That is, assume $ F_k < 2^k $ for all $ k $ in this range.\n\n4. **Inductive Step**: We need to show that the property holds for $ n + 1 $:\n   - From the Fibonacci definition, we have:\n     $$ F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} $$\n   - By the inductive hypothesis, we know:\n     $$ F_n < 2^n \quad \text{and} \quad F_{n-1} < 2^{n-1} $$\n   - Therefore:\n     $$ F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} < 2^n + 2^{n-1} $$\n   - We can factor out $ 2^{n-1} $:\n     $$ F_{n+1} < 2^{n-1}(2 + 1) = 2^{n-1} \cdot 3 $$\n   - Since $ 3 < 4 $, we have:\n     $$ F_{n+1} < 2^{n-1} \cdot 4 = 2^{n+1} $$\n   - Thus, $ F_{n+1} < 2^{n+1} $ holds.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By strong induction, we have shown that $ F_n < 2^n $ for all $ n \geq 1 $.\n\n### Summary\nStrong induction allows us to assume the property holds for all previous cases up to $ n $ to prove it for $ n + 1 $. This is particularly useful in recursive sequences like the Fibonacci sequence, where each term depends on the previous terms. The method is robust and can be applied to various properties of the Fibonacci sequence, such as inequalities or relationships with other mathematical concepts.
