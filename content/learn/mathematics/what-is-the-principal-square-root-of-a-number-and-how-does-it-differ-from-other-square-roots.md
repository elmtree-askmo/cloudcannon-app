    The principal square root is the non-negative value of a number that, when squared, equals the original number, distinguished from general square roots which include both positive and negative solutions.

    What is the principal square root of a number, and how does it differ from other square roots?
answer: >-
    The principal square root of a number is defined as the non-negative value that, when squared, equals the original number. It is denoted using the radical sign, represented as $\sqrt{x}$. For example, the principal square root of 16 is 4, since $4^2 = 16$. \n\nThe key distinction between the principal square root and other square roots lies in the fact that every positive number has two square roots: one positive (the principal square root) and one negative. For instance, both 3 and -3 are square roots of 9 because $3^2 = 9$ and $(-3)^2 = 9$. However, when the square root symbol is used without any additional notation, it specifically refers to the principal square root, which is always non-negative.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Principal Square Root**: The non-negative square root of a number, denoted as $\sqrt{x}$.\n- **General Square Roots**: Include both the positive and negative values that satisfy the equation $y^2 = x$.\n\nThis distinction is crucial in mathematics, especially in contexts where the non-negativity of the square root is important, such as in graphing functions or solving equations.
