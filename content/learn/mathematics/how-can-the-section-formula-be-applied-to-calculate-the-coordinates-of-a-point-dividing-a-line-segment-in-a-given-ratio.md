answer: >-
    The section formula is a powerful mathematical tool used to determine the coordinates of a point that divides a line segment into a specific ratio. This formula is particularly useful in coordinate geometry.\n\nTo apply the section formula, consider two points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \). If a point $ P $ divides the line segment $ AB $ in the ratio $ m:n $, the coordinates of point $ P $ can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\nP(x, y) = \left( \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} \right)\n$$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's say we have the following points:\n- Point $ A $ at coordinates \( (2, 3) \)\n- Point $ B $ at coordinates \( (4, 5) \)\n\nIf point $ P $ divides the segment $ AB $ in the ratio $ 1:2 $, we can substitute the values into the section formula:\n\n1. Identify $ m $ and $ n $:\n   - $ m = 1 $\n   - $ n = 2 $\n\n2. Substitute the coordinates of points $ A $ and $ B $ into the formula:\n\n$$\nP(x, y) = \left( \frac{1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 2}{1+2}, \frac{1 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 3}{1+2} \right)\n$$\n\n3. Calculate the coordinates:\n\n- For the x-coordinate:\n$$\nx = \frac{4 + 4}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n- For the y-coordinate:\n$$\ny = \frac{5 + 6}{3} = \frac{11}{3}\n$$\n\nThus, the coordinates of point $ P $ are:\n\n$$\nP = \left( \frac{8}{3}, \frac{11}{3} \right)\n$$\n\nThis means that point $ P $ is located at \( \left( \frac{8}{3}, \frac{11}{3} \right) \), effectively dividing the line segment $ AB $ in the specified ratio of $ 1:2 $. \n\nIn summary, the section formula provides a straightforward method to find the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment, making it an essential tool in geometry and various applications in mathematics and engineering.
