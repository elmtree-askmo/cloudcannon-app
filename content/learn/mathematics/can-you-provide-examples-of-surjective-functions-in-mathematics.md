    In mathematics, a surjective function, also known as an onto function, is defined such that for every element $ y $ in the codomain, there exists at least one element $ x $ in the domain such that \( f(x) = y \). Here are some examples of surjective functions:\n\n1. **Doubling Function**: Consider the function $ f: \{1, 2, 3\} \to \{2, 4, 6\} $ defined by \( f(x) = 2x \). This function is surjective because every element in the codomain \{2, 4, 6\} has a corresponding element in the domain \{1, 2, 3\}.\n\n2. **Residue Classes Modulo n**: The function $ f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} $ defined by \( f(x) = x \mod n \) is surjective. For any residue class $ r $ in $ \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} $, there exists an integer $ x $ such that \( f(x) = r \).\n\n3. **Identity Function**: The identity function $ f: X \to X $ defined by \( f(x) = x \) for all $ x \in X $ is trivially surjective, as every element in the codomain is mapped to itself.\n\n4. **Linear Function**: The function $ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ defined by \( f(x) = 2x - 1 \) is surjective. For any real number $ y $, you can find an $ x $ such that \( f(x) = y \) by solving $ 2x - 1 = y $.\n\n5. **Mapping Residents to States**: If we consider a function that maps residents of the United States to the states they live in, where the domain is the set of all residents and the codomain is the set of all 50 states, this function is surjective because every state has at least one resident.\n\nThese examples illustrate the concept of surjective functions in various contexts, demonstrating how every element in the codomain is covered by the function's mapping from the domain.
