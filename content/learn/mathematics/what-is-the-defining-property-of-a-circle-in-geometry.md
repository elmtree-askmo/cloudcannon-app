    The defining property of a circle in geometry is that all points on the circle are equidistant from a fixed point, known as the center, with the distance from the center to any point being the radius.

    What is the defining property of a circle in geometry?
answer: >-
    In geometry, the defining property of a circle is that it is a closed two-dimensional figure where all points on the circle are equidistant from a fixed point known as the center. This fixed distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius.\n\nTo summarize, a circle can be defined as follows:\n\n- **Definition**: A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance (the radius) from a given point (the center).\n- **Key Properties**:\n  - All points on the circle are equidistant from the center.\n  - The distance from the center to any point on the circle is constant and is referred to as the radius.\n  - Circles with the same radius are called congruent circles.\n\nThis fundamental property of equidistance is what distinguishes circles from other geometric shapes and is essential in various applications and mathematical operations involving circles.
