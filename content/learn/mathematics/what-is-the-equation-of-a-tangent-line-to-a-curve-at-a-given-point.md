    What is the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a given point?
answer: >-
    The equation of a tangent line to a curve at a given point can be derived using the concept of derivatives. A tangent line is a straight line that touches the curve at a specific point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. \n\nTo find the equation of the tangent line at a point \( (a, f(a)) \) on the curve defined by the function \( f(x) \), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the derivative** \( f'(a) \) to find the slope of the tangent line at the point $ x = a $.\n2. **Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line**, which is given by:\n   $$\n   y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)\n   $$\n   Here, \( f'(a) \) is the slope of the tangent line, and \( (a, f(a)) \) is the point of tangency.\n\n### Example\nFor the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), let's find the equation of the tangent line at the point where $ x = 1 $:\n\n1. **Calculate the derivative**:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 2x\n   $$\n   Therefore, at $ x = 1 $:\n   $$\n   f'(1) = 2(1) = 2\n   $$\n\n2. **Find the point on the curve**:\n   $$\n   f(1) = 1^2 = 1\n   $$\n   So the point is \( (1, 1) \).\n\n3. **Use the point-slope form**:\n   $$\n   y - 1 = 2(x - 1)\n   $$\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   $$\n   y = 2x - 2 + 1 \\\n   y = 2x - 1\n   $$\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line to the curve \( f(x) = x^2 \) at the point \( (1, 1) \) is $ y = 2x - 1 $. \n\nThis method can be applied to any differentiable function to find the equation of the tangent line at any point on its curve.
