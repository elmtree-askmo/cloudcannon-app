    What differences in position and orientation occur after a reflection?
answer: >-
    After a reflection transformation, the differences in position and orientation of a geometric figure can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Position**: The position of the reflected image is determined by the line of reflection. Each point of the original figure is mapped to a new point on the opposite side of the line of reflection, maintaining the same distance from the line. For example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). This means that the reflected image will be positioned symmetrically relative to the line of reflection.\n\n2. **Orientation**: While the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, the orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted. This means that the reflected image appears flipped. For instance, if you have a letter "P" and reflect it over the y-axis, it will appear as a "b". This inversion can be particularly noticeable in figures that have directional features, such as arrows or letters.\n\n3. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape. This is a key property of reflections, as they are classified as isometric transformations, which preserve distances between points.\n\n4. **Mathematical Representation**: In terms of functions, reflecting a function \(y = f(x)\) over the x-axis results in \(y = -f(x)\), while reflecting it over the y-axis results in \(y = f(-x)\). Reflecting over both axes can be represented as \(y = -f(-x)\).\n\n### Example:\n- If we take the point \( (3, 4) \) and reflect it over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be \( (-3, 4) \). The orientation of the point changes, but the distance from the line of reflection remains the same.\n\nIn summary, after a reflection, the position of the figure changes based on the line of reflection, while the orientation is inverted, but the size and shape remain unchanged.
