    How is the variance of a Bernoulli variable determined?
answer: >-
    The variance of a Bernoulli variable is determined using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Var}[X] = p(1 - p)\n$$\n\nwhere $ p $ is the probability of success (i.e., the probability that the random variable $ X $ takes the value 1). In a Bernoulli distribution, there are only two possible outcomes: success (1) with probability $ p $ and failure (0) with probability $ 1 - p $.\n\nTo derive this variance, we first note that the expected value (mean) of a Bernoulli random variable $ X $ is given by:\n\n$$\nE[X] = p\n$$\n\nThe variance measures how spread out the possible outcomes are from the mean. For a Bernoulli distribution, the variance can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. The expected value of $ X^2 $ is calculated as:\n   $$ \n   E[X^2] = 1^2 \cdot p + 0^2 \cdot (1 - p) = p \n   $$\n\n2. The variance is then computed using the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Var}[X] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = p - p^2 = p(1 - p)\n   $$\n\nThus, the variance of a Bernoulli random variable reflects the variability of the outcomes based on the probability of success $ p $ and the probability of failure $ 1 - p $. This characteristic makes the Bernoulli distribution a fundamental building block in probability theory and statistics, particularly in the context of binary outcomes.
