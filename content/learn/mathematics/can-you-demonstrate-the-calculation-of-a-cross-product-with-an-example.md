    To demonstrate the calculation of a cross product, let's use the vectors \(\vec{a} = (2, 3, 7)\) and \(\vec{b} = (1, 2, 4)\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the Vectors\nThe components of vector \(\vec{a}\) are:\n- \(x_a = 2\)\n- \(y_a = 3\)\n- \(z_a = 7\)\n\nThe components of vector \(\vec{b}\) are:\n- \(x_b = 1\)\n- \(y_b = 2\)\n- \(z_b = 4\)\n\n### Step 2: Use the Cross Product Formula\nThe cross product \(\vec{a} \times \vec{b}\) can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the unit vectors and the components of the vectors:\n\n$$\n\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \begin{vmatrix}\n\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\\nx_a & y_a & z_a \\\nx_b & y_b & z_b\n\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Determinant\nExpanding the determinant, we have:\n\n$$\n\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \hat{i} \begin{vmatrix}\n3 & 7 \\\n2 & 4\n\end{vmatrix} - \hat{j} \begin{vmatrix}\n2 & 7 \\\n1 & 4\n\end{vmatrix} + \hat{k} \begin{vmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\n1 & 2\n\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n\nCalculating each of the 2x2 determinants:\n\n1. For \(\hat{i}\):\n   $$\n   \begin{vmatrix}\n   3 & 7 \\\n   2 & 4\n   \end{vmatrix} = (3)(4) - (7)(2) = 12 - 14 = -2\n   $$\n\n2. For \(\hat{j}\):\n   $$\n   \begin{vmatrix}\n   2 & 7 \\\n   1 & 4\n   \end{vmatrix} = (2)(4) - (7)(1) = 8 - 7 = 1\n   $$\n\n3. For \(\hat{k}\):\n   $$\n   \begin{vmatrix}\n   2 & 3 \\\n   1 & 2\n   \end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (3)(1) = 4 - 3 = 1\n   $$\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nNow substituting back into the equation:\n\n$$\n\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -2\hat{i} - 1\hat{j} + 1\hat{k}\n$$\n\nThus, we can express the cross product as:\n\n$$\n\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = (-2, -1, 1)\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe cross product of the vectors \(\vec{a} = (2, 3, 7)\) and \(\vec{b} = (1, 2, 4)\) is \((-2, -1, 1)\). This resultant vector is perpendicular to both \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\).
