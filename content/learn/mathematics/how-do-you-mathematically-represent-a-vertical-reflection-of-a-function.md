    How do you mathematically represent a vertical reflection of a function?
answer: >-
    To mathematically represent a vertical reflection of a function, you can use the following transformation rule:\n\nIf you have a function \( f(x) \), the vertical reflection of this function over the x-axis is represented as:\n\n$$\ny = -f(x)\n$$\n\nThis transformation effectively flips the graph of the function upside down. In this case, the x-values remain unchanged, while the y-values are negated, meaning that each output of the original function is multiplied by -1. \n\n### Example\nFor instance, consider the parent function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The vertical reflection of this function would be:\n\n$$\ny = -f(x) = -x^2\n$$\n\nIn this example, the graph of \( f(x) = x^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards, while the graph of $ y = -x^2 $ is a parabola opening downwards, demonstrating the effect of the vertical reflection.\n\n### Steps to Identify Reflections\n1. **Create Tables**: Construct tables for the original function \( y = f(x) \) and its reflection \( y = -f(x) \) using the same x-values.\n2. **Evaluate Functions**: Calculate the outputs for both functions for given inputs.\n3. **Compare Outputs**: Observe that the y-values of the reflected function are the opposites of the original function's y-values.\n4. **Graph the Functions**: Plot both functions to visually confirm the reflection over the x-axis.\n\nThis method allows you to clearly see how the transformation affects the graph and the relationship between the original and reflected functions.
