    How do you determine a particular solution for a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation?
answer: >-
    To determine a particular solution for a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Homogeneous Term**: The first step is to identify the non-homogeneous part of the recurrence relation, denoted as \( f(n) \). This term is what makes the recurrence non-homogeneous.\n\n2. **Guess the Form of the Particular Solution**: Based on the form of \( f(n) \), you can make an educated guess about the form of the particular solution \( F_p(n) \). Common forms include:\n   - If \( f(n) \) is a polynomial of degree $ k $, then guess a polynomial of the same degree.\n   - If \( f(n) \) is an exponential function $ A \cdot r^n $, then guess a particular solution of the form $ B \cdot r^n $.\n   - If \( f(n) \) is a sinusoidal function (like \( A \sin(n\theta) + B \cos(n\theta) \)), then guess a particular solution of the same form.\n\n3. **Adjust for Overlap with the Homogeneous Solution**: If the guessed form of the particular solution overlaps with the solution of the associated homogeneous recurrence relation, you need to multiply your guess by $ n $ (or a higher power of $ n $ if necessary) to ensure linear independence.\n\n4. **Substitute into the Recurrence**: Substitute your guessed particular solution \( F_p(n) \) back into the original non-homogeneous recurrence relation. This will allow you to solve for the coefficients in your guess.\n\n5. **Solve for Coefficients**: After substituting, equate coefficients of like terms on both sides of the equation to solve for the unknown coefficients in your guessed particular solution.\n\n6. **Combine with the Homogeneous Solution**: Finally, the general solution to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation is given by the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous part and the particular solution:\n   $$\n   F(n) = F_h(n) + F_p(n)\n   $$\n   where \( F_h(n) \) is the general solution to the associated homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\n### Example\nConsider the non-homogeneous recurrence relation:\n$$\nF_n = 2F_{n-1} + 3F_{n-2} + n^2\n$$\n1. The non-homogeneous term is \( f(n) = n^2 \).\n2. Guess a particular solution of the form \( F_p(n) = An^2 + Bn + C \).\n3. Substitute \( F_p(n) \) into the recurrence and solve for $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ by equating coefficients.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine a particular solution for a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.
