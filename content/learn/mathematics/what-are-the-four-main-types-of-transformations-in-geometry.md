    What are the four main types of transformations in geometry?
answer: >-
    The four main types of transformations in geometry are:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation involves moving a geometric figure from one location to another without altering its shape, size, or orientation. Every point of the figure is shifted the same distance in a specified direction. For example, if a triangle is translated 3 units to the right and 2 units up, each vertex of the triangle will move accordingly.\n\n2. **Reflection**: In a reflection, a geometric figure is flipped over a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This creates a mirror image of the original figure. For instance, reflecting a point (x, y) across the x-axis results in the point (x, -y), while reflecting across the y-axis results in (-x, y).\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation involves turning a geometric figure around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation. The figure is rotated by a certain angle, which can be measured in degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise). For example, rotating a point (x, y) 90 degrees counterclockwise around the origin results in the new coordinates (-y, x).\n\n4. **Dilation**: Dilation changes the size of a geometric figure while maintaining its shape. This transformation involves a center point and a scale factor. If the scale factor is greater than 1, the figure enlarges; if it is between 0 and 1, the figure shrinks. For example, a dilation of a point (x, y) with a scale factor of 2 results in the point (2x, 2y).\n\nThese transformations can be applied individually or combined to create more complex geometric figures and relationships. Each transformation has specific rules and properties that govern how the coordinates of points change during the transformation process.
