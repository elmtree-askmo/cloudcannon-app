    How do conjunctions and disjunctions differ in compound inequalities?
answer: >-
    Conjunctions and disjunctions are two fundamental types of compound inequalities that differ in how they combine the conditions of the inequalities.\n\n1. **Conjunction (AND)**:\n   - A conjunction requires that both conditions must be true simultaneously. For example, consider the compound inequality $2 \leq x < 5$. This means that $x$ must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than 5 at the same time. The solution set for this inequality is the intersection of the two individual inequalities, which can be graphically represented on a number line as the region between 2 and 5, including 2 but not including 5. In interval notation, this is expressed as \([2, 5)\).\n\n2. **Disjunction (OR)**:\n   - A disjunction, on the other hand, requires that at least one of the conditions must be true. For example, the compound inequality $x < 2$ or $x > 6$ indicates that $x$ can be any value less than 2 or any value greater than 6. The solution set for this inequality is the union of the two individual inequalities, represented graphically as two separate regions on the number line. In interval notation, this is expressed as \((-\infty, 2) \cup (6, \infty)\).\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the requirement for the truth of the conditions: conjunctions require both conditions to be satisfied simultaneously, while disjunctions require that at least one condition is satisfied. This distinction affects how the solution sets are represented both graphically and in interval notation.
