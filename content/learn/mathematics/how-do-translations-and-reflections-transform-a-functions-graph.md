    How do translations and reflections transform a function's graph?
answer: >-
    Translations and reflections are two fundamental transformations that can significantly alter the graph of a function.\n\n### Translations\nTranslations involve shifting the graph of a function either horizontally or vertically without changing its shape. \n\n1. **Horizontal Translations**: \n   - To shift a function horizontally, you modify the input variable. For example, if you have a function \(f(x)\), the transformation \(f(x - c)\) shifts the graph to the right by $c$ units, while \(f(x + c)\) shifts it to the left by $c$ units. \n   - For instance, the function \(g(x) = (x - 2)^2\) represents a horizontal shift of the parabola \(f(x) = x^2\) to the right by 2 units.\n\n2. **Vertical Translations**: \n   - To shift a function vertically, you add or subtract a constant from the function. For example, \(f(x) + k\) shifts the graph up by $k$ units, while \(f(x) - k\) shifts it down by $k$ units.\n   - An example is \(h(x) = x^2 + 3\), which shifts the graph of \(f(x) = x^2\) upward by 3 units.\n\n### Reflections\nReflections involve flipping the graph of a function over a specific axis, which changes its orientation.\n\n1. **Reflection Across the x-axis**: \n   - To reflect a function across the x-axis, you multiply the function by -1. For example, if \(f(x)\) is the original function, the reflected function is \(-f(x)\).\n   - For instance, the function \(g(x) = -x^2\) reflects the parabola \(f(x) = x^2\) across the x-axis, resulting in an upside-down parabola.\n\n2. **Reflection Across the y-axis**: \n   - To reflect a function across the y-axis, you replace $x$ with $-x$. The transformation is represented as \(f(-x)\).\n   - For example, the function \(g(x) = (-x)^2\) is the same as \(f(x) = x^2\) since squaring a negative number yields the same result, but it illustrates the concept of reflection.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, translations shift the graph of a function without altering its shape, while reflections flip the graph over a specified axis, changing its orientation. Understanding these transformations is crucial for graphing functions effectively and analyzing their properties.
