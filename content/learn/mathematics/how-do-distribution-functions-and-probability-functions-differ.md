    How do distribution functions and probability functions differ?
answer: >-
    The distinction between distribution functions and probability functions is fundamental in probability theory and statistics. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of their differences:\n\n1. **Probability Distribution Function (PDF)**:\n   - The term "Probability Distribution Function" often refers to the Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous random variables. The PDF describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a specific value. For continuous variables, the PDF does not provide probabilities directly; instead, it provides a density, which means that the probability of the variable falling within a particular range is given by the integral of the PDF over that range.\n   - Mathematically, for a continuous random variable $X$ with PDF $f(x)$, the probability that $X$ falls within the interval $[a, b]$ is given by:\n   $$\n   P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n\n2. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:\n   - The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. The CDF can be defined for both discrete and continuous random variables. For a continuous random variable, the CDF $F(x)$ is the integral of the PDF from negative infinity to $x$:\n   $$\n   F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) \, dt\n   $$\n   - For discrete random variables, the CDF is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes up to a certain point:\n   $$\n   F(k) = \sum_{i \leq k} P(X = i)\n   $$\n\n3. **Key Differences**:\n   - **Nature**: The PDF provides a density function for continuous variables, while the CDF provides cumulative probabilities.\n   - **Output**: The PDF can yield values greater than 1 (as it represents density), but the CDF always ranges from 0 to 1, representing cumulative probabilities.\n   - **Usage**: The PDF is used to find probabilities over intervals, while the CDF is used to find the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a specific value.\n\nIn summary, while both the PDF and CDF are essential for understanding the behavior of random variables, they serve different purposes and are defined differently. The PDF focuses on the density of probabilities at specific points, whereas the CDF accumulates probabilities up to a certain value.
