    The basic power rule in calculus provides a method for differentiating functions of the form f(x) = x^n. It states that the derivative is d/dx(x^n) = n * x^(n-1), allowing for quick calculations of derivatives for polynomial, negative, and fractional exponents.

    What is the basic power rule, and how is it applied in calculations?
answer: >-
    The basic power rule is a fundamental principle in calculus used to differentiate functions of the form \( f(x) = x^n \), where $ n $ is any real number. The power rule states that the derivative of $ x^n $ is given by:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n \cdot x^{n-1}\n$$\n\n### Application of the Power Rule\n\nTo apply the power rule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the exponent**: Determine the value of $ n $ in the expression $ x^n $.\n2. **Multiply by the exponent**: Take the exponent $ n $ and multiply it by the entire term $ x^n $.\n3. **Reduce the exponent**: Decrease the exponent by 1 to get $ x^{n-1} $.\n\n#### Example\n\nFor instance, if you want to find the derivative of \( f(x) = x^3 \):\n\n1. Identify $ n = 3 $.\n2. Apply the power rule: \n   $$ \n   f'(x) = 3 \cdot x^{3-1} = 3x^2 \n   $$\n\nThis rule is particularly useful because it allows for quick differentiation of polynomial functions, making it a staple in calculus. It can also be applied to functions with negative exponents and fractional exponents, broadening its utility in various mathematical contexts.
