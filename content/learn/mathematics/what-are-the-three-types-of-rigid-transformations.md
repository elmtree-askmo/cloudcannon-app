    What are the three types of rigid transformations?
answer: >-
    The three types of rigid transformations are:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation moves every point of a figure the same distance in a specified direction. It does not alter the shape or size of the figure, merely its position in the coordinate plane.\n\n2. **Reflection**: This transformation flips a figure over a line (the line of reflection), creating a mirror image. Like translation, reflection preserves the size and shape of the figure.\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation turns a figure around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a certain angle. The distance from the center of rotation to any point on the figure remains constant, thus preserving the figure's size and shape.\n\nAll three types of rigid transformations maintain the distances and angles between points, ensuring that the original figure and its image are congruent.
