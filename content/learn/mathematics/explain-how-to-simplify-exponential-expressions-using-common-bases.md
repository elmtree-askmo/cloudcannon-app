    Explain how to simplify exponential expressions using common bases.
answer: >-
    To simplify exponential expressions using common bases, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Common Bases**: Look for a common base that can represent the different bases in the expression. For example, if you have bases like 8 and 4, you can express both in terms of base 2, since $8 = 2^3$ and $4 = 2^2$.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Exponents**: Once you have identified a common base, rewrite each term in the expression using this base. For instance, if you have $8^x$ and $4^y$, you can rewrite them as:\n   $$\n   8^x = (2^3)^x = 2^{3x}\n   $$\n   $$\n   4^y = (2^2)^y = 2^{2y}\n   $$\n\n3. **Combine the Exponents**: If you are multiplying or dividing expressions with the same base, you can combine the exponents. For example:\n   - Multiplication: $2^{3x} \cdot 2^{2y} = 2^{3x + 2y}$\n   - Division: $\frac{2^{3x}}{2^{2y}} = 2^{3x - 2y}$\n\n4. **Equate the Exponents**: If you are solving an equation, once you have the same base, you can set the exponents equal to each other. For example, if you have:\n   $$\n   2^{3x} = 2^{2y}\n   $$\n   You can equate the exponents:\n   $$\n   3x = 2y\n   $$\n\n5. **Solve for the Variable**: After equating the exponents, solve for the variable as you would in any algebraic equation.\n\n### Example\nConsider the expression $8^x \cdot 4^2$. To simplify:\n\n1. Rewrite using a common base:\n   $$\n   8^x = (2^3)^x = 2^{3x}, \quad 4^2 = (2^2)^2 = 2^4\n   $$\n\n2. Combine the exponents:\n   $$\n   8^x \cdot 4^2 = 2^{3x} \cdot 2^4 = 2^{3x + 4}\n   $$\n\nThis process allows you to simplify complex exponential expressions effectively by leveraging the properties of exponents and common bases. \n\n### Important Properties\n- When multiplying expressions with the same base: \n  $$ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} $$\n- When dividing expressions with the same base:\n  $$ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} $$\n- When raising a power to a power:\n  $$ (a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n} $$\n\nBy using these properties, you can simplify and manipulate exponential expressions with ease.
