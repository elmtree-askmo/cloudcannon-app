answer: >-
    To write a quadratic equation from contextual information using given points and the vertex, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is a crucial point, typically denoted as \((h, k)\). This point represents the maximum or minimum of the quadratic function, depending on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards.\n\n2. **Use the Vertex Form**: With the vertex identified, you can start with the vertex form of a quadratic equation:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   Here, $a$ is a coefficient that determines the direction and width of the parabola.\n\n3. **Choose Another Point**: Select another point \((x_1, y_1)\) that lies on the parabola. This point will help you determine the value of $a$.\n\n4. **Substitute the Point into the Equation**: Substitute the coordinates of the chosen point into the vertex form equation to solve for $a$:\n   $$\n   y_1 = a(x_1 - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   Rearranging this equation will allow you to isolate $a$.\n\n5. **Solve for $a$**: After substituting the values, solve for $a$. This will give you the specific coefficient needed for your quadratic equation.\n\n6. **Write the Quadratic Equation**: Once you have $a$, substitute it back into the vertex form equation to complete the quadratic equation.\n\n7. **Convert to Standard Form (if needed)**: If you need the equation in standard form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, you can expand the vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   Expanding this will yield:\n   $$\n   y = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k\n   $$\n   Distributing $a$ and combining like terms will give you the standard form.\n\n### Example\nSuppose the vertex of the parabola is \((3, 4)\) and you have another point \((5, 8)\).\n\n1. Start with the vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - 3)^2 + 4\n   $$\n\n2. Substitute the point \((5, 8)\):\n   $$\n   8 = a(5 - 3)^2 + 4\n   $$\n   Simplifying gives:\n   $$\n   8 = a(2)^2 + 4 \\\n   8 = 4a + 4 \\\n   4 = 4a \\\n   a = 1\n   $$\n\n3. Now substitute $a$ back into the vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = 1(x - 3)^2 + 4\n   $$\n\n4. Expand to convert to standard form:\n   $$\n   y = (x - 3)^2 + 4 \\\n   = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 \\\n   = x^2 - 6x + 13\n   $$\n\nThus, the quadratic equation in standard form is:\n$$\ny = x^2 - 6x + 13\n$$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively write a quadratic equation from contextual information using given points and the vertex.
