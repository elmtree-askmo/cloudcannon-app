    Bi-implication is a logical operator denoting a relationship between two propositions that are true under the same conditions. It is represented by the symbol ↔ and has a truth table showing its truth values based on the combinations of the propositions.

    Define bi-implication and explain its truth table.
answer: >-
    Bi-implication, also known as equivalence, is a logical operator that expresses a relationship between two propositions, indicating that both propositions are true under the same conditions. In propositional logic, the bi-implication is denoted by the symbol ↔ or sometimes by the notation $ p \iff q $. The statement $ p \iff q $ can be read as "p if and only if q," meaning that both $ p $ and $ q $ must either be true together or false together.\n\n### Truth Table for Bi-implication\n\nThe truth table for the bi-conditional operator is as follows:\n\n| $ p $ | $ q $ | $ p \iff q $ |\n|---------|---------|-----------------|\n| T       | T       | T               |\n| T       | F       | F               |\n| F       | T       | F               |\n| F       | F       | T               |\n\n### Explanation of the Truth Table\n\n- **When both $ p $ and $ q $ are true (T, T)**: The bi-implication $ p \iff q $ is true because both propositions are true.\n- **When $ p $ is true and $ q $ is false (T, F)**: The bi-implication $ p \iff q $ is false because the truth values do not match.\n- **When $ p $ is false and $ q $ is true (F, T)**: The bi-implication $ p \iff q $ is false for the same reason as above; the truth values do not match.\n- **When both $ p $ and $ q $ are false (F, F)**: The bi-implication $ p \iff q $ is true because both propositions are false, thus matching in truth value.\n\nIn summary, the bi-implication operator is true when both propositions share the same truth value, either both true or both false, and it is false when one is true and the other is false. This operator is essential in logical reasoning and proofs, as it establishes a strong equivalence between the two propositions involved.
