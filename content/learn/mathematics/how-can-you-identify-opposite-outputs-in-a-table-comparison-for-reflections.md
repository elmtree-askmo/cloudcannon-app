    To identify opposite outputs in a table comparison for reflections, particularly when reflecting a function over the x-axis, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Steps to Identify Opposite Outputs\n\n1. **Create Tables**: Start by creating two tables: one for the original function \( y = f(x) \) and another for its reflection \( y = -f(x) \). Use the same set of input values (x-values) for both tables.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Functions**: For each input value $ x $, calculate the output for both the original function and the reflected function. For example, if you have \( f(x) = x^2 \), compute \( f(x) \) and \( -f(x) \) for various $ x $ values.\n\n3. **Compare Outputs**: After evaluating the functions, compare the outputs from both tables. You should observe that the y-values from the reflected function are the negatives of the corresponding y-values from the original function. This means if \( f(x) = y \), then for the reflection, you will have \( -f(x) = -y \).\n\n4. **Graph the Functions**: To visually confirm the reflection, graph both functions on the same coordinate plane. The reflected graph should appear as a mirror image of the original graph across the x-axis.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n\n| $ x $ | \( f(x) = x^2 \) | \( -f(x) \) |\n|---------|------------------|--------------|\n| -2      | 4                | -4          |\n| -1      | 1                | -1          |\n| 0       | 0                | 0           |\n| 1       | 1                | -1          |\n| 2       | 4                | -4          |\n\nIn this table, you can see that for every output \( f(x) \), the corresponding output for the reflection \( -f(x) \) is indeed the opposite. For instance, when $ x = 2 $, \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( -f(2) = -4 \).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively identify opposite outputs in a table comparison for reflections over the x-axis. This method not only helps in understanding the concept of reflections but also aids in graphing and analyzing function transformations.
