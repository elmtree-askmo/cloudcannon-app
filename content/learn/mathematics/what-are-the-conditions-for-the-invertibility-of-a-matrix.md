    The Invertible Matrix Theorem outlines the conditions for an n x n matrix to be invertible, including determinant non-zero, full rank, linear independence, span of columns, non-zero eigenvalues, and expressibility in terms of elementary matrices.

    What are the conditions for the invertibility of a matrix?
answer: >-
    The conditions for the invertibility of a matrix are encapsulated in the Invertible Matrix Theorem, which provides a series of equivalent statements for an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ to be invertible. Here are the key conditions:\n\n1. **Existence of Inverse**: A matrix $A$ is invertible if there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB = I$ and $BA = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n2. **Determinant**: A matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero, i.e., \(\text{det}(A) \neq 0\).\n\n3. **Rank**: A matrix $A$ is invertible if it has full rank, meaning the rank of $A$ is equal to $n$ (the number of its rows or columns).\n\n4. **Linear Independence**: The columns of $A$ are linearly independent if and only if $A$ is invertible. This implies that there is at most one solution to the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ for every vector $\mathbf{b}$.\n\n5. **Span**: The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$ if $A$ is invertible, meaning that for every vector $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has at least one solution.\n\n6. **Eigenvalues**: A matrix $A$ is invertible if all its eigenvalues are non-zero.\n\n7. **Elementary Matrices**: A matrix $A$ is invertible if it can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices.\n\n8. **Transpose**: The transpose of an invertible matrix $A$ is also invertible, and \((A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T\).\n\nThese conditions provide a comprehensive framework for determining whether a matrix is invertible, and they are fundamental in the study of linear algebra.
