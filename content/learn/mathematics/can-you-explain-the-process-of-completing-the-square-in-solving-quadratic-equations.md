    Can you explain the process of completing the square in solving quadratic equations?
answer: >-
    Completing the square is a method used to solve quadratic equations and convert them from the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to the vertex form \(a(x - h)^2 + k = 0\). This technique is particularly useful for finding the roots of the equation and understanding the properties of the quadratic function.\n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step process for completing the square:\n\n1. **Start with the Standard Form**: Begin with the quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. If $a \neq 1$, divide the entire equation by $a$ to make the coefficient of $x^2$ equal to 1. The equation will then look like $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0$.\n\n2. **Rearrange the Equation**: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}\n   $$\n\n3. **Add the Square of Half the Coefficient of $x$**: Take the coefficient of $x$ (which is $\frac{b}{a}$), divide it by 2, and square it. This value is \(\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\). Add this value to both sides of the equation:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n4. **Factor the Left Side**: The left side of the equation is now a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:\n   $$\n   \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n5. **Simplify the Right Side**: Calculate the right side to simplify the equation:\n   $$\n   \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n6. **Solve for $x$**: To find the values of $x$, take the square root of both sides:\n   $$\n   x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}\n   $$\n   Finally, isolate $x$:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}\n   $$\n\nThis method not only helps in solving quadratic equations but also provides insights into the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic function, which is useful in various applications, including optimization problems in business and sports.
