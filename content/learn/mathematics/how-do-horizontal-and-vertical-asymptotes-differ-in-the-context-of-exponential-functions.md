    How do horizontal and vertical asymptotes differ in the context of exponential functions?
answer: >-
    In the context of exponential functions, horizontal and vertical asymptotes serve different purposes and indicate different behaviors of the function.\n\n### Horizontal Asymptotes\nA horizontal asymptote describes the behavior of a function as the input variable $x$ approaches infinity (or negative infinity). For exponential functions, the horizontal asymptote is typically the x-axis, represented by the line $y = 0$. This means that as $x$ increases or decreases without bound, the value of the function approaches but never actually reaches zero. \n\nFor example, consider the exponential function $y = 2^x$:\n- As $x$ approaches negative infinity, $y$ approaches 0. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n\n### Vertical Asymptotes\nVertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the function approaches infinity, typically where the function is undefined. In the case of exponential functions, vertical asymptotes are not common. However, if we consider a function that includes an exponential term in the denominator, such as \(f(x) = \frac{1}{e^x}\), we can observe vertical asymptotic behavior. \n\nFor instance:\n- The function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{e^x}\) has a vertical asymptote at $x = -\infty$ because as $x$ approaches negative infinity, \(f(x)\) approaches infinity.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Horizontal Asymptotes** indicate the end behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity. For exponential functions, this is usually $y = 0$.\n- **Vertical Asymptotes** indicate points where the function approaches infinity, typically where the function is undefined. Exponential functions generally do not have vertical asymptotes unless they are part of a more complex function.\n\nUnderstanding these asymptotic behaviors is crucial for graphing exponential functions and analyzing their growth or decay characteristics.
