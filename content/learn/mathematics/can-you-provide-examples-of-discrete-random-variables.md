    Discrete random variables are variables that can take on a countable number of distinct values. Here are some examples of discrete random variables:\n\n1. **Number of Heads in Coin Flips**: When flipping a coin three times, the number of heads obtained can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. This is a classic example of a discrete random variable.\n\n2. **Rolling a Die**: The outcome of rolling a standard six-sided die can be any integer from 1 to 6. Each face of the die represents a distinct value.\n\n3. **Number of Defective Products**: In a manufacturing process, the number of defective products in a batch can be counted. For example, if a factory produces 100 items, the number of defective items could be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 100.\n\n4. **Number of Children in a Family**: The number of children in a family is another example of a discrete random variable, as it can take on values like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\n5. **Number of Sales in a Day**: A store may track the number of items sold in a day, which can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n6. **Binomial Random Variable**: This is a specific type of discrete random variable that counts the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin multiple times).\n\n7. **Poisson Random Variable**: This type of discrete random variable counts the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, such as the number of emails received in an hour.\n\nThese examples illustrate the nature of discrete random variables, which can take on specific, countable values rather than a continuous range.
