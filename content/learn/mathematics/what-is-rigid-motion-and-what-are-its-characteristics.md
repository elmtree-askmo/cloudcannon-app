    What is rigid motion and what are its characteristics?
answer: >-
    Rigid motion, also known as isometry, is a transformation in geometry that preserves the shape and size of geometric figures. This means that when a figure undergoes a rigid motion, its dimensions remain unchanged, and the distances between points are maintained. Here are the key characteristics of rigid motion:\n\n1. **Preservation of Distances**: Rigid motions maintain the distance between any two points in the figure. For example, if points A and B are transformed to points A' and B', the distance between A and B will equal the distance between A' and B', expressed mathematically as $AB = A'B'$.\n\n2. **Preservation of Angles**: Rigid motions also preserve angle measures. If a triangle ABC is transformed into triangle A'B'C' through a rigid motion, the angles ∠ABC and ∠A'B'C' will be equal.\n\n3. **Types of Rigid Motions**: Common types of rigid motions include:\n   - **Translations**: Moving every point of a figure the same distance in a specified direction.\n   - **Reflections**: Flipping a figure over a line (the line of reflection) to create a mirror image.\n   - **Rotations**: Turning a figure around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a certain angle.\n\n4. **Congruence**: Rigid motions are essential in defining congruence between geometric figures. Two figures are congruent if one can be transformed into the other through a series of rigid motions.\n\n5. **Effect on Position and Orientation**: While rigid motions preserve size and shape, they can change the position and orientation of the figure in the coordinate plane. For instance, a rotation may change the direction a figure faces, while a translation will move it to a different location.\n\n6. **Decomposition**: Rigid motions can often be decomposed into simpler motions, such as a translation followed by a rotation about a point.\n\nIn summary, rigid motion is a fundamental concept in geometry that allows for the transformation of figures while preserving their essential properties, making it a crucial tool for understanding congruence and symmetry in geometric figures.
