    What is the first step in finding the tangent to a curve?
answer: >-
    The first step in finding the tangent to a curve is to **find the derivative** of the function that defines the curve. The derivative, denoted as \( f'(x) \), represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve. \n\nOnce you have the derivative, you can proceed to calculate the gradient of the tangent by substituting the specific $ x $ value into the derivative. This will give you the slope of the tangent line at that point. \n\nIn summary, the steps to find the tangent to a curve are as follows:\n\n1. **Find the derivative** of the function \( f(x) \).\n2. **Calculate the gradient** of the tangent by substituting the desired $ x $ value into the derivative.\n3. **Determine the equation** of the tangent line using the point-slope form \( y - b = m(x - a) \), where \( (a, b) \) is the point on the curve and $ m $ is the slope obtained from the derivative.\n\nThis process allows you to accurately find the equation of the tangent line at a specific point on the curve.
