    What is the coordinate rule for a 90 degrees counterclockwise rotation?
answer: >-
    The coordinate rule for a 90 degrees counterclockwise rotation about the origin is given by the transformation:\n\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (-y, x)$$\n\nThis means that for any point with coordinates \((x, y)\), after a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, the new coordinates will be \((-y, x)\).\n\nFor example, if we take the point \(A(-4, 3)\), applying the rule results in:\n\n$$\nA' = (-3, -4)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for other points:\n- \(B(-4, 1) \rightarrow B'(-1, -4)\)\n- \(C(-3, 0) \rightarrow C'(0, -3)\)\n- \(D(0, 2) \rightarrow D'(-2, 0)\)\n- \(E(-3, 4) \rightarrow E'(-4, -3)\)\n\nThus, the vertices of the rotated figure after applying the 90 degrees counterclockwise rotation are:\n- \(A'(-3, -4)\)\n- \(B'(-1, -4)\)\n- \(C'(0, -3)\)\n- \(D'(-2, 0)\)\n- \(E'(-4, -3)\)\n\nThis transformation is a fundamental concept in geometry, particularly in the study of rotations and transformations on the coordinate plane.
