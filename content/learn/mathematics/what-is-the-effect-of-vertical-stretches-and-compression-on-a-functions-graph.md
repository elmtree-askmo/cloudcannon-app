    What is the effect of vertical stretches and compression on a function's graph?
answer: >-
    Vertical stretches and compressions are transformations that affect the height of a function's graph. When a function \( f(x) \) is modified to \( g(x) = a f(x) \), where $ a $ is a constant, the graph undergoes a vertical transformation based on the value of $ a $.\n\n1. **Vertical Stretch**: If the constant $ a > 1 $, the graph of the function is vertically stretched. This means that every point on the graph moves away from the horizontal axis (x-axis), effectively doubling or increasing its distance from the x-axis. For example, if $ a = 2 $, then for any input $ t $, the output value becomes \( 2f(t) \), resulting in a graph that is stretched vertically.\n\n2. **Vertical Compression**: Conversely, if $ 0 < a < 1 $, the graph is vertically compressed. This transformation reduces the height of the graph, making it appear "squished" towards the x-axis. For instance, if $ a = 0.5 $, the output values are halved, leading to a graph that is compressed vertically.\n\n3. **Reflection**: If $ a $ is negative, the graph not only stretches or compresses but also reflects across the x-axis. This means that the vertical transformation will flip the graph upside down in addition to altering its height.\n\nIn summary, the effect of vertical stretches and compressions on a function's graph is determined by the constant $ a $:\n- $ a > 1 $: Vertical stretch\n- $ 0 < a < 1 $: Vertical compression\n- $ a < 0 $: Vertical stretch/compression with reflection across the x-axis\n\nThese transformations are fundamental in function analysis, allowing for manipulation of the graph's shape while preserving its overall characteristics.
