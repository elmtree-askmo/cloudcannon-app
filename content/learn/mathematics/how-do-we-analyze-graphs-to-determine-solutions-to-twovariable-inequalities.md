answer: >-
    To analyze graphs for determining solutions to two-variable inequalities, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Graph the Boundary Line**: Start by converting the inequality into an equation by replacing the inequality sign with an equal sign. For example, if you have the inequality $y < 2x + 5$, graph the line $y = 2x + 5$. \n\n2. **Determine the Type of Boundary Line**: If the original inequality is $≤$ or $≥$, draw a solid line. This indicates that points on the line are included in the solution set. If the inequality is $<$ or $>$, draw a dashed line, indicating that points on the line are not included in the solution set.\n\n3. **Choose a Test Point**: Select a test point that is not on the boundary line to determine which side of the line to shade. A common choice is the origin (0,0), unless it lies on the line. Substitute the coordinates of the test point into the original inequality:\n   - If the inequality holds true, shade the region that contains the test point.\n   - If it does not hold true, shade the opposite side of the line.\n\n4. **Identify the Solution Region**: The shaded area represents all the solutions to the inequality. Any point within this shaded region (including the boundary line if it is solid) is a solution to the inequality.\n\n5. **Check Ordered Pairs**: To verify if specific ordered pairs are solutions, substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of the ordered pair into the original inequality. If the inequality is satisfied, then that ordered pair is a solution.\n\nFor example, consider the inequality $y > x + 4$:\n- Graph the line $y = x + 4$ with a dashed line.\n- Choose a test point, such as (0,0). Substituting gives $0 > 0 + 4$, which is false, so shade the area above the line.\n\nIn summary, the graphical representation of a two-variable inequality allows you to visualize the solution set as a shaded region in the coordinate plane, where every point in that region satisfies the inequality.
