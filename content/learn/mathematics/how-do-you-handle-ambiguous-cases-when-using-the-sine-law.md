    How do you handle ambiguous cases when using the Sine Law?
answer: >-
    When handling ambiguous cases while using the Sine Law, it is essential to recognize that this situation arises specifically when you are given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA). The ambiguity occurs because two different angles can yield the same sine value, leading to multiple possible triangles. Here are the key outcomes to consider:\n\n1. **No Triangle Exists**: If the sine value calculated for the angle is out of the valid range (-1 < sin B < 1), then no triangle can be formed.\n\n2. **One Triangle Exists**: If the angle is acute and the side opposite the angle is equal to the height from the vertex to the base (i.e., the side is equal to the altitude), then only one triangle exists. Similarly, if the angle is obtuse, there will also be only one triangle.\n\n3. **Two Triangles Exist**: If the angle is acute and the side opposite the angle is less than the height from the vertex to the base, two different triangles can be formed. This is the classic ambiguous case where both configurations are valid.\n\nTo summarize, when using the Law of Sines in the SSA scenario, you should:\n- Calculate the sine of the angle.\n- Check if the sine value is within the valid range.\n- Determine the number of possible triangles based on the relationship between the given sides and angles.\n\nThis systematic approach will help you navigate the ambiguous cases effectively.
