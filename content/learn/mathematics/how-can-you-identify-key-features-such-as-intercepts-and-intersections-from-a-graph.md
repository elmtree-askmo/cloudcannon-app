answer: >-
    To identify key features such as intercepts and intersections from a graph, you can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. **Finding Intercepts**\n- **Y-Intercept**: This is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercept of a function \( f(x) \), evaluate \( f(0) \). For example, in the quadratic function $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, the y-intercept is at the point \( (0, c) \).\n\n- **X-Intercepts**: These are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. To find the x-intercepts, solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \). For quadratic functions, this can be done using the quadratic formula:\n  $$\n  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  $$\n  The x-intercepts indicate the roots of the function and can show how many solutions (real roots) the function has.\n\n### 2. **Identifying Intersections**\n- **Graph Intersections**: To find where two graphs intersect, set their equations equal to each other and solve for $ x $. The solutions will give you the x-coordinates of the intersection points. Substitute these $ x $-values back into either function to find the corresponding $ y $-coordinates.\n\n### 3. **Analyzing Key Features**\n- **Vertices**: For quadratic functions, the vertex represents the maximum or minimum point of the graph. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using:\n  $$\n  x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n  $$\n  Substitute this $ x $-value back into the function to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n- **Asymptotes**: For functions like rational or exponential functions, identify any vertical or horizontal asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur where the function is undefined (e.g., division by zero), while horizontal asymptotes indicate the behavior of the function as $ x $ approaches infinity.\n\n### 4. **Using Symmetry**\n- For functions that exhibit symmetry (like even functions), you can choose points that are equidistant from the axis of symmetry to help in accurately capturing the function's behavior.\n\n### 5. **Graphical Representation**\n- Plotting points around the identified intercepts and key features can help visualize the function's behavior. This is particularly useful for understanding the overall shape and characteristics of the graph.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively identify and analyze the key features of functions from their graphs, which is essential for understanding their behavior and relationships.
