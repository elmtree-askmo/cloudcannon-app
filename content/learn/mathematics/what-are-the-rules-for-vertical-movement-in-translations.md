    What are the rules for vertical movement in translations?
answer: >-
    The rules for vertical movement in translations, also known as vertical shifts, are straightforward and can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**: A vertical shift is a rigid transformation that moves the graph of a function up or down on the Cartesian plane without changing its shape or size. This is achieved by adding or subtracting a constant from the function's output.\n\n2. **Upward Shift**: To shift the graph of a function \( f(x) \) upward by $ d $ units (where $ d > 0 $), the new function is expressed as:\n   $$\n   f(x) + d\n   $$\n   This means that every point on the graph is moved up by $ d $ units.\n\n3. **Downward Shift**: To shift the graph downward by $ d $ units (where $ d < 0 $), the new function is expressed as:\n   $$\n   f(x) - d\n   $$\n   In this case, every point on the graph is moved down by $ d $ units.\n\n4. **Effect on Coordinates**: In both cases, the x-coordinates of the points on the graph remain unchanged, while the y-coordinates are modified by adding or subtracting the constant $ d $.\n\n5. **Rigid Transformation**: It is important to note that vertical shifts are rigid transformations, meaning they do not alter the shape or size of the graph; they only change the location of the graph vertically.\n\nUnderstanding these rules is essential for analyzing how functions behave under transformations and for graphing functions accurately in the coordinate plane.
