    Can you provide examples of practice problems for signed numbers?
answer: >-
    Here are some examples of practice problems for signed numbers, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:\n\n### Addition Problems\n1. \( (+5) + (+3) = ? \)\n2. \( (-7) + (-2) = ? \)\n3. \( (+4) + (-6) = ? \)\n4. \( (-10) + (+5) = ? \)\n\n### Subtraction Problems\n1. \( (+8) - (+3) = ? \)\n2. \( (-5) - (-2) = ? \)\n3. \( (+6) - (-4) = ? \)\n4. \( (-3) - (+7) = ? \)\n\n### Multiplication Problems\n1. \( (+4) \times (+3) = ? \)\n2. \( (-6) \times (-2) = ? \)\n3. \( (+5) \times (-3) = ? \)\n4. \( (-7) \times (+2) = ? \)\n\n### Division Problems\n1. \( (+12) \div (+4) = ? \)\n2. \( (-15) \div (-3) = ? \)\n3. \( (+20) \div (-5) = ? \)\n4. \( (-24) \div (+6) = ? \)\n\n### Solutions\n1. \( (+5) + (+3) = +8 \)\n2. \( (-7) + (-2) = -9 \)\n3. \( (+4) + (-6) = -2 \)\n4. \( (-10) + (+5) = -5 \)\n\n5. \( (+8) - (+3) = +5 \)\n6. \( (-5) - (-2) = -3 \)\n7. \( (+6) - (-4) = +10 \)\n8. \( (-3) - (+7) = -10 \)\n\n9. \( (+4) \times (+3) = +12 \)\n10. \( (-6) \times (-2) = +12 \)\n11. \( (+5) \times (-3) = -15 \)\n12. \( (-7) \times (+2) = -14 \)\n\n13. \( (+12) \div (+4) = +3 \)\n14. \( (-15) \div (-3) = +5 \)\n15. \( (+20) \div (-5) = -4 \)\n16. \( (-24) \div (+6) = -4 \)\n\nThese problems can help students practice their understanding of signed numbers and the rules for operations involving them.
