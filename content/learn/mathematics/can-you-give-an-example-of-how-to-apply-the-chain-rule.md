answer: >-
    The chain rule is a fundamental technique in calculus used to differentiate composite functions. It states that if you have a function that is composed of two or more functions, the derivative of that composite function can be found by differentiating the outer function and multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function.\n\n### Example of Applying the Chain Rule\n\nLet's consider the function \( f(x) = (4x - 3)^5 \). To differentiate this function using the chain rule, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the outer and inner functions**:\n   - Outer function: \( f(u) = u^5 \) where \( u = 4x - 3 \)\n   - Inner function: \( g(x) = 4x - 3 \)\n\n2. **Differentiate the outer function**:\n   - The derivative of the outer function \( f(u) \) with respect to \( u \) is:\n     $$ f'(u) = 5u^4 $$\n\n3. **Differentiate the inner function**:\n   - The derivative of the inner function \( g(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is:\n     $$ g'(x) = 4 $$\n\n4. **Apply the chain rule**:\n   - According to the chain rule, the derivative of \( f(x) \) is given by:\n     $$ f'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) $$\n   - Substituting the derivatives we found:\n     $$ f'(x) = 5(4x - 3)^4 \cdot 4 $$\n\n5. **Simplify the result**:\n   - Therefore, the derivative of \( f(x) \) is:\n     $$ f'(x) = 20(4x - 3)^4 $$\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the chain rule allows us to differentiate composite functions efficiently. In the example above, we differentiated \( (4x - 3)^5 \) by first identifying the outer and inner functions, finding their derivatives, and then applying the chain rule to arrive at the final result. This method can be applied to a wide variety of functions, making it an essential tool in calculus.
