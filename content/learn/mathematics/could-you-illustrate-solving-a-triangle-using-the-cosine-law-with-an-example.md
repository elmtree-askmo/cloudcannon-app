answer: >-
    To illustrate solving a triangle using the Cosine Law, let's consider an example where we know two sides and the included angle. \n\n### Example:\nGiven a triangle ABC, we have:\n- Side $ a = 8 $\n- Side $ b = 11 $\n- Angle $ C = 37^\circ $\n\nWe want to find the length of side $ c $.\n\n### Step 1: Apply the Law of Cosines\nThe Law of Cosines states that:\n\n$$\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the known values\nSubstituting the known values into the formula:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 8^2 + 11^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 11 \cdot \cos(37^\circ)\n$$\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- $ 8^2 = 64 $\n- $ 11^2 = 121 $\n- $ 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 11 = 176 $\n- \( \cos(37^\circ) \approx 0.7986 \) (using a calculator)\n\nNow substituting these values back into the equation:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 64 + 121 - 176 \cdot 0.7986\n$$\n\nCalculating $ 176 \cdot 0.7986 $:\n\n$$\n176 \cdot 0.7986 \approx 140.0\n$$\n\nNow substituting this back into the equation:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 64 + 121 - 140.0\n$$\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 185 - 140.0 = 45\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Solve for $ c $\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find $ c $:\n\n$$\nc = \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the length of side $ c $ is approximately $ 6.71 $ units. This example demonstrates how the Law of Cosines can be effectively used to solve for an unknown side in a triangle when two sides and the included angle are known.
