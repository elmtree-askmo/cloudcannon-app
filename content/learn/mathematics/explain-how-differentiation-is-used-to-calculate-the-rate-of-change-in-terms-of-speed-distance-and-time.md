    Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that is used to calculate the rate of change of a function with respect to its variables. In the context of speed, distance, and time, differentiation allows us to understand how distance changes over time, which is essential for analyzing motion.\n\n### Rate of Change in Motion\n\n1. **Distance and Time Relationship**:\n   The relationship between distance, speed, and time can be expressed mathematically. If we denote distance as \(d(t)\), where $t$ is time, the speed of an object is defined as the rate of change of distance with respect to time. This can be represented as:\n   $$\n   \text{Speed} = \frac{d(t)}{dt}\n   $$\n   Here, \(d(t)\) is a function that describes how distance changes over time.\n\n2. **Example of a Distance Function**:\n   Consider a distance function given by \(d(t) = 5t^2\). To find the speed (rate of change of distance) at any time $t$, we differentiate this function:\n   $$\n   d'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}(5t^2) = 10t\n   $$\n   This derivative \(d'(t) = 10t\) represents the speed of the object at time $t$. For instance, at $t = 2$ seconds, the speed would be \(d'(2) = 10 \times 2 = 20\) meters per second.\n\n3. **Instantaneous vs. Average Rate of Change**:\n   - **Instantaneous Rate of Change**: This is the speed at a specific moment in time, which is calculated using the derivative as shown above.\n   - **Average Rate of Change**: This is calculated over an interval and is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{d(t_2) - d(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}\n   $$\n   where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are two different times. This gives the overall speed between those two points in time.\n\n4. **Acceleration**:\n   Differentiation can also be applied to find acceleration, which is the rate of change of velocity (or speed) over time. If we have a velocity function \(v(t)\), the acceleration \(a(t)\) is given by:\n   $$\n   a(t) = \frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n   $$\n   This tells us how the speed of the object is changing at any given moment.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, differentiation is a powerful tool in calculus that allows us to calculate the rate of change of distance with respect to time, which is interpreted as speed. By differentiating distance functions, we can find instantaneous speeds, average speeds over intervals, and even acceleration, providing a comprehensive understanding of motion dynamics.
