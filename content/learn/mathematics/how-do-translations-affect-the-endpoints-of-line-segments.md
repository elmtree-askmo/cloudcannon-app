    Translations in geometry refer to the process of sliding a geometric figure from one position to another without altering its shape, size, or orientation. When it comes to line segments, translations specifically affect the endpoints of the segment.\n\n### How Translations Affect the Endpoints of Line Segments\n\n1. **Definition of Translation**: A translation can be described mathematically by a vector that indicates how far and in which direction to move each point of the figure. For a line segment defined by its endpoints \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \), a translation by a vector \( \vec{v} = (a, b) \) will result in new endpoints \( A'(x_1 + a, y_1 + b) \) and \( B'(x_2 + a, y_2 + b) \).\n\n2. **Algebraic Representation**: If we denote the original endpoints of the line segment as \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \), after a translation by the vector \( (a, b) \), the new coordinates of the endpoints can be expressed as:\n   - New endpoint $ A' $: \n     $$\n     A' = (x_1 + a, y_1 + b)\n     $$\n   - New endpoint $ B' $: \n     $$\n     B' = (x_2 + a, y_2 + b)\n     $$\n\n3. **Visualization**: To visualize this, imagine a line segment drawn on a coordinate plane. If you apply a translation vector, you can think of "sliding" the entire segment to a new location. The distance between the endpoints remains the same, and the segment retains its original orientation and length.\n\n4. **Properties of Translations**: \n   - **Rigid Motion**: Translations are a type of rigid motion, meaning that the shape and size of the figure do not change. The line segment remains congruent to its original form.\n   - **Distance Preservation**: The distance between the endpoints before and after the translation remains constant. If the original distance $ d $ between points $ A $ and $ B $ is calculated using the distance formula:\n     $$\n     d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n     $$\n     After translation, the distance between $ A' $ and $ B' $ will still equal $ d $.\n\n5. **Example**: Consider a line segment with endpoints \( A(2, 3) \) and \( B(5, 7) \). If we translate this segment by the vector \( (3, -2) \):\n   - New endpoint \( A' = (2 + 3, 3 - 2) = (5, 1) \)\n   - New endpoint \( B' = (5 + 3, 7 - 2) = (8, 5) \)\n   The translated line segment will have endpoints \( A'(5, 1) \) and \( B'(8, 5) \).\n\nIn summary, translations affect the endpoints of line segments by shifting their positions according to a specified vector while preserving the segment's length and orientation. This transformation is fundamental in understanding geometric relationships and properties in the coordinate plane.
