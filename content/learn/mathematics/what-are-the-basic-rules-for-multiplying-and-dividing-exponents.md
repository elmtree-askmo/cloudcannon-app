    What are the basic rules for multiplying and dividing exponents?
answer: >-
    The basic rules for multiplying and dividing exponents are governed by several key properties of exponents. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of these properties and how they apply to multiplication and division of exponential expressions:\n\n1. **Product of Powers**: When multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, you add the exponents:\n   $$ a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} $$\n   **Example**: $ 2^3 \cdot 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7 = 128 $\n\n2. **Quotient of Powers**: When dividing two exponential expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents:\n   $$ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} $$\n   **Example**: $ \frac{5^6}{5^2} = 5^{6-2} = 5^4 = 625 $\n\n3. **Power of a Power**: When raising an exponential expression to another exponent, you multiply the exponents:\n   $$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$$\n   **Example**: \( (3^2)^3 = 3^{2 \cdot 3} = 3^6 = 729 \)\n\n4. **Multiplying Fractional Exponents**: When multiplying numbers with fractional exponents, the same rules apply:\n   $$\n   a^{m/n} \times a^{p/q} = a^{(mq + pn) / (nq)}\n   $$\n\n5. **Dividing Fractional Exponents**: When dividing numbers with fractional exponents, you also follow the same principle:\n   $$\n   a^{m/n} \div a^{p/q} = a^{(mq - pn) / (nq)}\n   $$\n\n6. **Negative Fractional Exponents**: A negative fractional exponent indicates the reciprocal:\n   $$\n   x^{-m/n} = \frac{1}{x^{m/n}}\n   $$\n\nThese properties allow for effective manipulation of expressions involving exponents, whether they are whole numbers or fractions. Understanding these rules is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations that involve exponential terms. If you have specific examples or further questions, feel free to ask!
