    What is the definition of congruent figures in geometry?
answer: >-
    In geometry, congruent figures are defined as two objects that have the same shape and size. This means that if one figure can be transformed into the other through a series of movements such as turning (rotation), flipping (reflection), or sliding (translation), then the two figures are considered congruent. \n\nMore specifically, congruent figures have identical corresponding side lengths and corresponding angles that are equal in measure. For example, if you have two triangles, they are congruent if all three sides of one triangle are equal in length to the three sides of the other triangle, and all three angles are equal as well.\n\nIn summary, congruent figures can be described as follows:\n- They have the same dimensions and shape.\n- Their corresponding parts (sides and angles) are identical.\n- They can be made to coincide through transformations such as rotation, reflection, or translation.\n\nThis concept is fundamental in geometry and is often denoted using the symbol "≅" to indicate congruence between figures.
