    What is the difference between discrete and continuous quantitative variables?
answer: >-
    The difference between discrete and continuous quantitative variables lies in the types of values they can take.\n\n1. **Discrete Quantitative Variables**: These variables can take on a finite or countably infinite number of values. This means that the values can be counted and are often whole numbers. For example, the number of students in a classroom, the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of goals scored in a soccer match are all discrete variables. They cannot take on fractional values; for instance, you cannot have 2.5 students.\n\n2. **Continuous Quantitative Variables**: In contrast, continuous variables can take any value within a given range and can include fractions and decimals. These variables are measured rather than counted. Examples include height, weight, temperature, and time. For instance, a person's height can be 170.5 cm, and weight can be 65.3 kg, illustrating that continuous variables can take on an infinite number of values within a specified range.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that discrete variables are countable and take specific values, while continuous variables can take any value within a range and are measurable.
