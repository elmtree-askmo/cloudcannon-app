    What is the formula for the sum of a geometric series?
answer: >-
    The formula for the sum of a geometric series is given by:\n\n$$\nS_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ S_n $ is the sum of the first $ n $ terms of the geometric series,\n- $ a $ is the first term of the series,\n- $ r $ is the common ratio (the factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term),\n- $ n $ is the number of terms to be summed.\n\nFor example, consider the geometric series 2, 4, 8, 16, ... where $ a = 2 $ and $ r = 2 $. If you want to find the sum of the first 4 terms, you would substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$$\nS_4 = 2 \frac{1 - 2^4}{1 - 2} = 2 \frac{1 - 16}{-1} = 2 \cdot 15 = 30.\n$$\n\nThis formula is valid as long as the common ratio $ r $ is not equal to 1. If $ r = 1 $, the series does not converge in the traditional sense, as all terms are equal to $ a $, and the sum would simply be $ n \cdot a $. \n\nUnderstanding the properties of geometric series is essential in various fields of mathematics, including calculus and financial mathematics, where they are used to model growth processes and calculate present values of annuities.
