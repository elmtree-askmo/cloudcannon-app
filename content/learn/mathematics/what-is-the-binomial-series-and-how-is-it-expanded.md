    What is the binomial series and how is it expanded?
answer: >-
    The binomial series is a mathematical expansion of the expression \((a + b)^n\), where $n$ is a non-negative integer. The expansion is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n$$\n\nIn this formula, $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n$$\n\nwhere $n!$ (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n\n### Key Points of the Binomial Series:\n\n1. **Binomial Coefficients**: The coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ count the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements, which is fundamental in combinatorics.\n\n2. **Applications**: The binomial series is widely used in combinatorics, probability, and algebra. It allows for the calculation of coefficients in polynomial expansions and is essential in deriving the binomial theorem.\n\n3. **Example**: For $n = 3$, the expansion of \((a + b)^3\) would be:\n   $$\n   (a + b)^3 = \binom{3}{0} a^3 b^0 + \binom{3}{1} a^2 b^1 + \binom{3}{2} a^1 b^2 + \binom{3}{3} a^0 b^3\n   $$\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   $$\n   (a + b)^3 = 1 \cdot a^3 + 3 \cdot a^2b + 3 \cdot ab^2 + 1 \cdot b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\n   $$\n\n4. **Generalization**: The binomial series can also be extended to non-integer values of $n$ using the generalized binomial theorem, which involves infinite series.\n\nIn summary, the binomial series provides a powerful tool for expanding expressions of the form \((a + b)^n\) and has significant implications in various fields of mathematics.
