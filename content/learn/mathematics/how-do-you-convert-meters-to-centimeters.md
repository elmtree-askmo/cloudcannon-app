    How do you convert meters to centimeters?
answer: >-
    To convert meters to centimeters, you can follow a straightforward process based on the metric system's prefixes and the movement of the decimal point.\n\n1. **Identify the Units**: You are converting from meters (m) to centimeters (cm).\n2. **Understand the Relationship**: In the metric system, 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. This means that to convert meters to centimeters, you need to multiply the number of meters by 100.\n3. **Decimal Point Movement**: Alternatively, you can visualize this conversion using a number line. Since centimeters are smaller than meters, you will move the decimal point two places to the right.\n\n### Example Conversion\nFor instance, to convert 7 meters to centimeters:\n- Start with 7 meters.\n- Move the decimal point two places to the right: $7 \rightarrow 700$ centimeters.\n\nThus, 7 meters is equal to 700 centimeters.\n\n### Summary\nThe conversion from meters to centimeters can be summarized as:\n$$\n\text{Centimeters} = \text{Meters} \times 100\n$$\n\nThis method can be applied to any measurement in meters to find the equivalent in centimeters by simply multiplying by 100 or moving the decimal point two places to the right.
