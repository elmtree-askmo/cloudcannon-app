    What techniques are used to simplify algebraic expressions?
answer: >-
    To simplify algebraic expressions, several techniques can be employed. Here are the primary methods:\n\n1. **Factoring**: This technique involves expressing a polynomial as a product of its factors. For example, the quadratic expression $x^2 - 5x + 6$ can be factored into \((x - 2)(x - 3)\). Factoring is particularly useful for solving polynomial equations and simplifying expressions.\n\n2. **Expanding**: This is the reverse of factoring, where you distribute terms to eliminate parentheses. For instance, expanding the expression \((x + 2)(x - 3)\) results in:\n   $$\n   x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 = x^2 - x - 6.\n   $$\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms**: This involves identifying and summing terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, simplifying the expression $3x + 2x - 5$ results in:\n   $$\n   5x - 5.\n   $$\n\n4. **Using Properties of Equality**: When solving equations, you can manipulate both sides of the equation using properties such as the addition property (adding the same value to both sides) and the multiplication property (multiplying both sides by the same non-zero value). For example, to solve the equation $2x + 3 = 7$, you would first subtract 3 from both sides:\n   $$\n   2x = 4,\n   $$\n   and then divide both sides by 2 to find $x = 2$.\n\n5. **Simplifying Complex Fractions**: This involves simplifying fractions that contain fractions in the numerator, denominator, or both. Techniques may include finding a common denominator or multiplying by a form of one.\n\n6. **Rationalizing Denominators**: This technique is used to eliminate radicals from the denominator of a fraction. For example, to simplify $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, you would multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$ to get:\n   $$\n   \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n   $$\n\nThese techniques are fundamental in algebra and are essential for manipulating expressions and solving equations effectively.
