    How do you compose two functions and what are the properties of composite functions?
answer: >-
    To compose two functions, you apply one function to the result of another. If you have two functions, $ f $ and $ g $, the composite function is denoted as \( (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \). This means you first evaluate \( g(x) \) and then use that result as the input for $ f $.\n\n### Example of Function Composition\nFor instance, if you have:\n- \( f(x) = x^2 \)\n- \( g(x) = x + 1 \)\n\nThe composite function \( (f \circ g)(x) \) would be calculated as follows:\n$$\n(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2\n$$\n\n### Properties of Composite Functions\n1. **Associativity**: Function composition is associative, meaning that if you have three functions $ f $, $ g $, and $ h $, then:\n   $$\n   f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h\n   $$\n\n2. **Not Commutative**: In general, $ f \circ g \neq g \circ f $. The order in which functions are composed matters.\n\n3. **Identity Function**: For any function $ f $, the composition with the identity function $ I $ (where \( I(x) = x \)) satisfies:\n   $$\n   f \circ I = f \quad \text{and} \quad I \circ f = f\n   $$\n\n4. **Domain and Range**: The domain of the composite function $ f \circ g $ is determined by the domain of $ g $ and the values that $ g $ takes that must lie within the domain of $ f $.\n\n5. **Chain Rule**: When differentiating composite functions, the chain rule is applied. If \( y = f(g(x)) \), then the derivative is given by:\n   $$\n   \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)\n   $$\n\nThese properties are essential in calculus, especially when dealing with derivatives and integrals of composite functions. Understanding how to compose functions and their properties allows for more complex mathematical modeling and problem-solving.
