    Explain the negative exponent rule and provide an example.
answer: >-
    The negative exponent rule is a fundamental concept in exponentiation that states:\n\n$$\na^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\n$$\n\nThis means that when a base $ a $ is raised to a negative exponent $ -n $, it is equivalent to taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent $ n $.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this rule:\n\nIf we have $ 2^{-3} $, we can apply the negative exponent rule:\n\n$$\n2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3}\n$$\n\nNow, calculating $ 2^3 $:\n\n$$\n2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\n$$\n\nThus, substituting back, we get:\n\n$$\n2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\nThis example shows how the negative exponent rule allows us to express negative exponents in a more manageable form, specifically as a fraction. This rule is particularly useful in simplifying expressions and solving equations involving exponents.
