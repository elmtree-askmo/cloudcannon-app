    What changes occur in the coordinates of a point when it is reflected?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across a specific axis, its coordinates change according to the axis of reflection. Hereâ€™s how the coordinates of a point change based on the axis of reflection:\n\n1. **Reflection Across the X-Axis**:\n   - If a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the x-axis, the new coordinates will be \(P'(x, -y)\). This means that the x-coordinate remains the same, while the y-coordinate is inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(2, 3)\), after reflection across the x-axis, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(2, -3)\).\n\n2. **Reflection Across the Y-Axis**:\n   - If a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be \(P'(-x, y)\). Here, the y-coordinate remains unchanged, while the x-coordinate is inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(5, 4)\), after reflection across the y-axis, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(-5, 4)\).\n\n3. **Reflection Across the Origin**:\n   - If a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the origin, the new coordinates will be \(P'(-x, -y)\). Both coordinates are inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(3, 4)\), after reflection across the origin, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(-3, -4)\).\n\nThese transformations maintain the distance from the line of reflection, ensuring that the reflected image is congruent to the original figure, albeit with a change in orientation. This concept is fundamental in geometry and is widely used in various applications, including computer graphics and physics.
