    When it comes to adding and subtracting exponents, it's important to understand that these operations can only be performed under specific conditions. Here are the rules:\n\n### Adding Exponents\n1. **Same Base and Same Exponent**: You can only add terms that have the same base and the same exponent. In this case, you add the coefficients (the numerical factors) of the terms while keeping the base and exponent unchanged.\n\n   **Example**:\n   $$\n   6x^5 + 4x^5 = (6 + 4)x^5 = 10x^5\n   $$\n\n2. **Different Exponents**: If the bases or exponents are different, you cannot combine them through addition.\n\n### Subtracting Exponents\n1. **Same Base and Same Exponent**: Similar to addition, you can subtract terms that have the same base and the same exponent by subtracting the coefficients.\n\n   **Example**:\n   $$\n   9x^3 - 13x^3 = (9 - 13)x^3 = -4x^3\n   $$\n\n2. **Different Exponents**: As with addition, if the bases or exponents differ, you cannot combine them through subtraction.\n\n### Summary\n- **Addition**: Combine coefficients if the base and exponent are the same.\n- **Subtraction**: Subtract coefficients if the base and exponent are the same.\n\nThese rules ensure that you can only combine like terms, which is a fundamental principle in algebra.
