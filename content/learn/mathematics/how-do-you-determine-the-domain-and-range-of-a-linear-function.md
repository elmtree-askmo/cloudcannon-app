    How do you determine the domain and range of a linear function?
answer: >-
    To determine the domain and range of a linear function, we can follow these guidelines:\n\n### Domain of a Linear Function\n1. **Definition**: The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.\n2. **Linear Functions**: For a typical linear function of the form \( f(x) = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept, the domain is generally all real numbers, denoted as \( \mathbb{R} \) or in interval notation as \( (-\infty, +\infty) \).\n3. **Special Cases**: If the linear function is defined in a specific context (e.g., a real-world scenario), the domain may be restricted to certain values. For example, if the function represents a physical quantity that cannot be negative, the domain might be limited to non-negative values.\n\n### Range of a Linear Function\n1. **Definition**: The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce.\n2. **Linear Functions**: Similar to the domain, the range of a typical linear function \( f(x) = mx + b \) is also all real numbers, \( \mathbb{R} \), unless specified otherwise. This is because as \( x \) takes on all real values, \( f(x) \) will also cover all real values.\n3. **Horizontal Lines**: If the linear function is a horizontal line (i.e., when the slope \( m = 0 \)), such as \( f(x) = b \), the range will be a single value, specifically \( \{b\} \).\n\n### Summary\n- For most linear functions, both the domain and range are \( \mathbb{R} \) (all real numbers).\n- In specific contexts, the domain and range may be restricted based on the situation being modeled.\n\n### Example\nFor the linear function \( f(x) = 2x - 2 \):\n- **Domain**: All real numbers, \( (-\infty, +\infty) \).\n- **Range**: All real numbers, \( (-\infty, +\infty) \).\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the domain and range of linear functions is straightforward, as they typically encompass all real numbers unless otherwise constrained by the context of the problem.
