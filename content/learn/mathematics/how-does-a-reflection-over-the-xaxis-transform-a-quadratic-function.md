    How does a reflection over the x-axis transform a quadratic function?
answer: >-
    A reflection over the x-axis transforms a quadratic function by flipping its graph upside down. This transformation can be mathematically represented by the equation \( g(x) = -f(x) \), where \( f(x) \) is the original quadratic function.\n\n### Key Points of Transformation:\n\n1. **Negation of Outputs**: For every point on the original graph represented as \( (x, f(x)) \), the reflected graph will have the corresponding point \( (x, -f(x)) \). This means that the y-values of the function are negated, effectively inverting the graph across the x-axis.\n\n2. **Visual Effect**: Consider the parent quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \). Its graph is a parabola that opens upwards. When reflected over the x-axis, the new function \( g(x) = -x^2 \) produces a parabola that opens downwards. This visual change is crucial for understanding how reflections affect the orientation of graphs.\n\n3. **General Reflection Rule**: The general rule for reflecting a function over the x-axis can be summarized as:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)\n   $$\n   This rule applies to all types of functions, including quadratic functions.\n\n4. **Effect on Function Characteristics**: While the shape of the graph remains the same, features such as intercepts and symmetry may change. For example, if the original function has a minimum point (the vertex of the parabola), the reflected function will have a corresponding maximum point at the same x-coordinate.\n\n5. **Graphical Representation**: When graphing both the original function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and its reflection \( g(x) = -x^2 \), the two graphs will be mirror images of each other across the x-axis. This can be visually confirmed by plotting both functions on the same coordinate plane.\n\n### Example:\n- For the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n  - Original: The vertex is at (0, 0) and opens upwards.\n  - Reflected: The function \( g(x) = -x^2 \) has its vertex at (0, 0) but opens downwards, making the vertex a maximum point instead of a minimum.\n\nIn summary, reflecting a quadratic function over the x-axis transforms its graph by inverting it, changing the orientation from opening upwards to opening downwards, while maintaining the x-coordinates of all points.
