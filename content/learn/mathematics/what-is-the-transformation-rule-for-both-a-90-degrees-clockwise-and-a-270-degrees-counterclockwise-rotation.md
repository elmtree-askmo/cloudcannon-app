    This content explains the transformation rules for 90 degrees clockwise and 270 degrees counterclockwise rotations in the coordinate plane, illustrating that both transformations result in the same change of coordinates from (x, y) to (y, -x).

    What is the transformation rule for both a 90 degrees clockwise and a 270 degrees counterclockwise rotation?
answer: >-
    The transformation rules for rotations in the coordinate plane are essential for understanding how points and figures change position when rotated around the origin. Specifically, for a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1. **90 Degrees Clockwise Rotation**:\n   - When a point \((x, y)\) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, the new coordinates become:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n   $$\n\n2. **270 Degrees Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n   - A 270-degree counterclockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, the transformation rule is the same:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n   $$\n\nIn summary, both a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation transform the coordinates \((x, y)\) to \((y, -x)\). This equivalence can be particularly useful when performing geometric transformations, as it allows for flexibility in how rotations are approached.
