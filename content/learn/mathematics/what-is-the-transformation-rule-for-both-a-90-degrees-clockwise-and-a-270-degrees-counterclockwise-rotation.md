    What is the transformation rule for both a 90 degrees clockwise and a 270 degrees counterclockwise rotation?
answer: >-
    The transformation rules for rotations in the coordinate plane are essential for understanding how points and figures change position when rotated around the origin. Specifically, for a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1. **90 Degrees Clockwise Rotation**:\n   - When a point \((x, y)\) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, the new coordinates become:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n   $$\n\n2. **270 Degrees Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n   - A 270-degree counterclockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, the transformation rule is the same:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n   $$\n\nIn summary, both a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation transform the coordinates \((x, y)\) to \((y, -x)\). This equivalence can be particularly useful when performing geometric transformations, as it allows for flexibility in how rotations are approached.
