    What are the key steps involved in an induction proof?
answer: >-
    The key steps involved in an induction proof are as follows:\n\n1. **Base Case (Initialization)**: This is the first step where you prove that the statement holds for the initial case, usually when $ n = 1 $ or $ n = 0 $. This establishes that the statement is true for the starting point of the induction.\n\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer $ k $. This assumption is crucial as it serves as the foundation for the next step. You denote this assumption as \( P(k) \).\n\n3. **Inductive Step**: Show that if the statement is true for $ n = k $ (i.e., \( P(k) \) is true), then it must also be true for $ n = k + 1 $ (i.e., \( P(k + 1) \)). This step often involves substituting the inductive hypothesis into the statement you want to prove for $ n = k + 1 $ and demonstrating that it holds.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: After proving both the base case and the inductive step, you conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers $ n \geq n_0 $ (where $ n_0 $ is the starting point of your induction, typically 1 or 0). This follows from the principle of mathematical induction, which asserts that if the base case is true and the inductive step holds, then the statement is true for all integers greater than or equal to $ n_0 $.\n\nThese steps form the backbone of mathematical induction, allowing you to establish the truth of an infinite number of cases based on a finite proof.
