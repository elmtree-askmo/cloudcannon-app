    How does normal induction differ from strong induction in terms of assumptions?
answer: >-
    Normal induction and strong induction are both methods used to prove statements about natural numbers, but they differ in the assumptions made during the inductive step.\n\n1. **Normal Induction**: In normal induction (also known as weak induction), the inductive hypothesis assumes that the statement \(P(k)\) is true for a specific integer $k$. The goal is then to prove that \(P(k+1)\) is also true based on this assumption. The structure can be summarized as follows:\n   - **Base Case**: Prove that \(P(1)\) (or \(P(0)\), depending on the context) is true.\n   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \(P(k)\) is true, and then prove \(P(k+1)\).\n\n2. **Strong Induction**: In strong induction, the inductive hypothesis is broader. Instead of assuming just \(P(k)\) is true, you assume that \(P(i)\) is true for all integers $i$ from the base case up to $k$ (i.e., \(P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)\)). This allows for a more powerful assumption, which can be particularly useful when proving statements that require knowledge of multiple previous cases. The structure is:\n   - **Base Case**: Prove that \(P(1)\) (or \(P(0)\)) is true.\n   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \(P(i)\) is true for all $1 \leq i \leq k$, and then prove \(P(k+1)\).\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the assumptions made during the inductive step:\n- **Normal Induction**: Assumes \(P(k)\) is true.\n- **Strong Induction**: Assumes \(P(i)\) is true for all $1 \leq i \leq k$.\n\nThis broader assumption in strong induction can simplify proofs, especially in cases where the truth of \(P(k+1)\) depends on multiple previous cases rather than just the immediate predecessor \(P(k)\).
