    What are the key properties that define a vector space?
answer: >-
    A vector space is defined by a set of properties that govern the behavior of its elements (vectors) under two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. Here are the key properties that define a vector space:\n\n1. **Closure under Addition**: For any two vectors $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ in the vector space $ V $, the sum $ v_1 + v_2 $ is also in $ V $.\n\n2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: For any vector $ v $ in the vector space $ V $ and any scalar $ c $, the product $ c \cdot v $ is also in $ V $.\n\n3. **Additive Identity**: There exists a vector $ 0 $ (the zero vector) in $ V $ such that for any vector $ v $ in $ V $, the equation $ v + 0 = v $ holds.\n\n4. **Additive Inverses**: For every vector $ v $ in $ V $, there exists a vector $ -v $ in $ V $ such that \( v + (-v) = 0 \).\n\n5. **Associativity of Addition**: For any vectors $ u, v, w $ in $ V $, the equation \( (u + v) + w = u + (v + w) \) holds.\n\n6. **Commutativity of Addition**: For any vectors $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ in $ V $, the equation $ v_1 + v_2 = v_2 + v_1 $ holds.\n\n7. **Distributive Properties**:\n   - For any scalar $ c $ and vectors $ u, v $ in $ V $, the equation \( c(u + v) = cu + cv \) holds.\n   - For any scalars $ a, b $ and vector $ v $ in $ V $, the equation \( (a + b)v = av + bv \) holds.\n\n8. **Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication**: For any scalars $ a, b $ and vector $ v $ in $ V $, the equation \( a(bv) = (ab)v \) holds.\n\n9. **Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication**: For any vector $ v $ in $ V $, the equation $ 1 \cdot v = v $ holds, where $ 1 $ is the multiplicative identity in the field of scalars.\n\nThese properties ensure that vector spaces behave consistently under the operations of addition and scalar multiplication, allowing for a rich structure that is fundamental in linear algebra and its applications.
