    What is the result of reflecting a point across the y-axis?
answer: >-
    When reflecting a point across the y-axis, the transformation affects the x-coordinate of the point while leaving the y-coordinate unchanged. \n\nFor a point $ P $ with coordinates \( (x, y) \), the result of reflecting this point across the y-axis will yield a new point $ P' $ with coordinates \( (-x, y) \). This means that the x-coordinate is negated, while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\n### Example:\nIf you have a point \( P(3, 5) \), after reflecting it across the y-axis, the new coordinates will be:\n$$\nP'(-3, 5)\n$$\n\nThis transformation is a type of rigid motion, meaning that the shape and size of the geometric figure remain unchanged, and only the orientation is altered. The reflection across the y-axis is a specific case of symmetry, where the line of reflection is the y-axis itself.
