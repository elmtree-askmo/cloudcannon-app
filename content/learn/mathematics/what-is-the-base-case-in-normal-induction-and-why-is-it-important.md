    What is the base case in normal induction, and why is it important?
answer: >-
    In normal induction, the base case is the initial step where you prove that the statement you want to establish is true for the first natural number, typically $n = 1$ (though it can start at any integer). This step is crucial because it serves as the foundation for the entire induction process. \n\nThe importance of the base case can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Foundation for Induction**: The base case establishes that the statement holds true for at least one specific instance. Without this initial truth, the subsequent steps of induction would lack a starting point.\n\n2. **Logical Validity**: The axiom of induction allows us to infer that if the base case is true and if we can show that the truth of the statement for an arbitrary natural number $k$ implies its truth for $k + 1$, then the statement must be true for all natural numbers. Thus, the base case is essential for the logical structure of the proof.\n\n3. **Building Up**: The process of induction can be visualized like a domino effect, where the base case is the first domino that falls, causing the others to follow. If the first domino does not fall (i.e., the base case is not proven), then the entire chain of reasoning collapses.\n\nIn summary, the base case is a critical component of mathematical induction, ensuring that the proof is grounded in a true statement, which allows for the extension of that truth to all natural numbers through the induction step.
