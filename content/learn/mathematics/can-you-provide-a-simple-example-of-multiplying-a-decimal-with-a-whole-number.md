answer: >-
    A simple example of multiplying a decimal with a whole number is as follows:\n\nLet's find the product of $0.2 \times 3$.\n\n**Step 1:** Ignore the decimal point and treat the numbers as whole numbers. So, we multiply 2 (from 0.2) by 3.\n\n$$\n2 \times 3 = 6\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Now, we need to place the decimal point back in the product. Since 0.2 has one decimal place, we place the decimal point one position from the right in the product.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$$\n0.2 \times 3 = 0.6\n$$\n\nThis method can be applied to any decimal and whole number multiplication by following the same steps: ignore the decimal, multiply, and then reinsert the decimal point based on the number of decimal places in the decimal number.
