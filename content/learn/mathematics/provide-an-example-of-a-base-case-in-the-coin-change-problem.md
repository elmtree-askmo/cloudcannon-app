    Provide an example of a base case in the Coin Change Problem.
answer: >-
    In the context of the Coin Change Problem, a base case is a specific instance that demonstrates the validity of the proposition we are trying to prove. For example, if we are proving that any amount $ n \geq 4 $ can be formed using 2-cent and 5-cent coins, we can establish the following base cases:\n\n1. **Base Case for $ n = 4 $**: \n   - We can make 4 cents using two 2-cent coins: $ 2 + 2 = 4 $.\n\n2. **Base Case for $ n = 5 $**: \n   - We can make 5 cents using one 5-cent coin: $ 5 = 5 $.\n\n3. **Base Case for $ n = 6 $**: \n   - We can make 6 cents using three 2-cent coins: $ 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 $.\n\n4. **Base Case for $ n = 7 $**: \n   - We can make 7 cents using one 5-cent coin and one 2-cent coin: $ 5 + 2 = 7 $.\n\n5. **Base Case for $ n = 8 $**: \n   - We can make 8 cents using four 2-cent coins: $ 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 $.\n\nThese base cases establish that the proposition holds true for the initial values, which is a crucial step in the process of mathematical induction. Once the base cases are verified, we can proceed to the inductive step, where we assume the proposition is true for some amount $ k $ and prove it for $ k + 1 $. This method helps in demonstrating that any amount greater than or equal to 4 can indeed be formed using the specified coin denominations.
