    How do coordinates change when a point is rotated 180 degrees around the origin?
answer: >-
    When a point is rotated 180 degrees around the origin in a coordinate plane, the coordinates of the point change according to a specific transformation rule. \n\nFor any point with coordinates \((x, y)\), after a 180-degree rotation around the origin, the new coordinates will be \((-x, -y)\). This transformation effectively reflects the point across the origin.\n\n### Example:\n- If you have a point \(P(4, -3)\):\n  - After a 180-degree rotation, the new coordinates will be:\n  $$\n  P'(-4, 3)\n  $$\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Understanding the Rotation**: \n   - A 180-degree rotation means that the point moves to the opposite side of the origin. \n   - This can be visualized as moving along a straight line that passes through the origin.\n\n2. **Symmetry**: \n   - The transformation is symmetric. For any point \((x, y)\), its rotated counterpart \((-x, -y)\) will also lie on the same line that connects the original point to the origin, but on the opposite side.\n\n3. **Geometric Figures**: \n   - If you consider geometric figures, such as circles or squares, rotating them 180 degrees around the origin will yield figures that are congruent to the original, maintaining their shape and size.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the rule for rotating a point \((x, y)\) by 180 degrees around the origin is simply to negate both coordinates, resulting in the new point \((-x, -y)\). This transformation is consistent across all points in the coordinate plane.
