    What changes occur in coordinates during vertical translations?
answer: >-
    During vertical translations, the coordinates of points on a graph undergo specific changes based on the addition or subtraction of a constant to the function's output. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how these changes occur:\n\n1. **Definition of Vertical Translation**: A vertical translation is a rigid transformation that shifts the entire graph of a function either upward or downward. This is achieved by adding or subtracting a constant value from the function's output (the y-coordinates).\n\n2. **Effect on Coordinates**:\n   - If a positive constant $ d $ is added to the function \( f(x) \), the new function becomes \( f(x) + d \). This results in every point on the graph being moved up by $ d $ units. For example, if the original point is \( (x, y) \), after the translation, the new point will be \( (x, y + d) \).\n   - Conversely, if a negative constant $ d $ is subtracted from the function, the new function is \( f(x) - d \). This shifts the graph down by $ d $ units, meaning that the original point \( (x, y) \) will now be at \( (x, y - d) \).\n\n3. **Mathematical Representation**:\n   - For an upward shift:\n     $$\n     \text{New Coordinates: } (x, y) \rightarrow (x, y + d) \quad \text{(where } d > 0\text{)}\n     $$\n   - For a downward shift:\n     $$\n     \text{New Coordinates: } (x, y) \rightarrow (x, y - d) \quad \text{(where } d < 0\text{)}\n     $$\n\n4. **Characteristics of Vertical Translations**:\n   - **Rigid Transformation**: Vertical translations do not change the shape or size of the graph; they only change its position on the coordinate plane.\n   - **Uniform Movement**: All points on the graph are moved the same vertical distance, ensuring that the overall structure of the graph remains intact.\n\nIn summary, during vertical translations, the y-coordinates of all points on the graph are modified by adding or subtracting a constant, while the x-coordinates remain unchanged. This results in a uniform upward or downward shift of the entire graph.
