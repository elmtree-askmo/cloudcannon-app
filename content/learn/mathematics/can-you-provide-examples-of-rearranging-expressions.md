    Rearranging expressions is a fundamental skill in algebra that involves changing the subject of a formula or equation. Here are some examples to illustrate how to rearrange expressions effectively:\n\n1. **Example 1: Rearranging a Linear Equation**\n   Given the equation:\n   $$ y = mx + c $$\n   To make $ x $ the subject, we can rearrange it as follows:\n   - Subtract $ c $ from both sides:\n     $$ y - c = mx $$\n   - Divide both sides by $ m $:\n     $$ x = \frac{y - c}{m} $$\n\n2. **Example 2: Rearranging a Quadratic Equation**\n   Consider the equation:\n   $$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$\n   To make $ r $ the subject, we can rearrange it:\n   - Multiply both sides by $ \frac{3}{4\pi} $:\n     $$ r^3 = \frac{3V}{4\pi} $$\n   - Take the cube root of both sides:\n     $$ r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} $$\n\n3. **Example 3: Rearranging an Equation with Subtraction**\n   Given the equation:\n   $$ a = b - 5 $$\n   To make $ b $ the subject, we can rearrange it:\n   - Add $ 5 $ to both sides:\n     $$ b = a + 5 $$\n\n4. **Example 4: Rearranging a Formula with Multiple Variables**\n   For the formula:\n   $$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$\n   To make $ h $ the subject, we rearrange it as follows:\n   - Multiply both sides by $ 2 $:\n     $$ 2A = bh $$\n   - Divide both sides by $ b $:\n     $$ h = \frac{2A}{b} $$\n\n5. **Example 5: Rearranging a Formula with a Square Root**\n   Given the equation:\n   $$ x = \sqrt{y + 3} $$\n   To make $ y $ the subject, we rearrange it:\n   - Square both sides:\n     $$ x^2 = y + 3 $$\n   - Subtract $ 3 $ from both sides:\n     $$ y = x^2 - 3 $$\n\nThese examples demonstrate the process of using inverse operations to isolate a variable and change the subject of the formula. The key is to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.
