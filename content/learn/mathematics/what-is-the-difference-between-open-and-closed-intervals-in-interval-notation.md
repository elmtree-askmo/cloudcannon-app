    What is the difference between open and closed intervals in interval notation?
answer: >-
    The difference between open and closed intervals in interval notation primarily revolves around the inclusion or exclusion of their endpoints.\n\n1. **Open Intervals**: An open interval is represented as \((a, b)\), where $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints. In this case, the interval includes all real numbers between $a$ and $b$ but does not include the endpoints themselves. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $a < x < b$. The notation uses parentheses to indicate that the endpoints are excluded. For example, the open interval \((2, 9)\) includes all numbers greater than 2 and less than 9, but not 2 or 9 themselves.\n\n2. **Closed Intervals**: A closed interval is denoted by square brackets, represented as $[a, b]$. This interval includes all real numbers $x$ such that $a \leq x \leq b$. In this case, both endpoints $a$ and $b$ are included in the interval. For example, the closed interval $[2, 9]$ includes all numbers from 2 to 9, including both 2 and 9.\n\n3. **Half-Open (or Half-Closed) Intervals**: These intervals include one endpoint but not the other. They are denoted by a combination of parentheses and brackets. For example, \([2, 9)\) means that 2 is included in the interval, while 9 is not, representing all numbers $x$ such that $2 \leq x < 9$. Conversely, the interval $(2, 9]$ includes 9 but not 2, representing all numbers $x$ such that $2 < x \leq 9$.\n\nUnderstanding these distinctions is crucial for solving problems involving ranges of values, such as in calculus, algebra, and other mathematical contexts.
