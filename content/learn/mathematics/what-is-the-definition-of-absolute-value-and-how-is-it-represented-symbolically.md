    What is the definition of absolute value and how is it represented symbolically?
answer: >-
    The absolute value of a real number $x$ is defined as the distance between $x$ and zero on the number line. This concept is crucial in mathematics as it provides a way to express the magnitude of a number without regard to its sign. \n\nSymbolically, the absolute value of $x$ is represented by vertical bars surrounding the number or expression, denoted as $|x|$. For example:\n- $|6| = 6$\n- $|-6| = 6$\n- $|0| = 0$\n\nIn general, the absolute value function can be expressed as:\n$$\nf(x) = |x|\n$$\nThis function outputs the non-negative value of $x$, effectively removing any negative sign. \n\nAdditionally, the absolute value can also be referred to as the modulus of a number, and it is sometimes written using the notation `abs()`, such that `abs(-1) = 1` is equivalent to $|-1| = 1$.\n\nIn summary, the absolute value is a fundamental mathematical concept that measures distance and is always non-negative, represented symbolically as $|x|$.
