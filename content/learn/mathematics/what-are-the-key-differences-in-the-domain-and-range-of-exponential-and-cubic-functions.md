    What are the key differences in the domain and range of exponential and cubic functions?
answer: >-
    The key differences in the domain and range of exponential and cubic functions are as follows:\n\n### Exponential Functions\n- **Domain**: The domain of exponential functions is all real numbers, denoted as \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This means that you can input any real number into the function.\n- **Range**: The range of exponential functions, particularly those of the form \( f(x) = a^x \) where $ a > 0 $, is strictly positive real numbers, denoted as \( (0, \infty) \). This indicates that the output of the function will never be zero or negative.\n\n### Cubic Functions\n- **Domain**: The domain of cubic functions is also all real numbers, denoted as \( (-\infty, \infty) \). Similar to exponential functions, you can input any real number into a cubic function.\n- **Range**: The range of cubic functions is all real numbers, denoted as \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This means that cubic functions can produce any real number as an output, including both positive and negative values.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Domain**: Both exponential and cubic functions have the same domain of all real numbers.\n- **Range**: Exponential functions have a range of \( (0, \infty) \), while cubic functions have a range of \( (-\infty, \infty) \).\n\nThese differences in range significantly affect the behavior and graphical representation of the functions, with exponential functions exhibiting growth that approaches zero but never touches it, while cubic functions can take on any value, including negative values.
