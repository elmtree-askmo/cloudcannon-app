answer: >-
    To solve a triangle using the Law of Sines, let's go through a step-by-step example. We will consider a triangle where we know two angles and one side (Angle-Side-Angle, ASA). \n\n### Example Problem\nGiven:\n- Angle A = 30°\n- Angle B = 45°\n- Side a (opposite Angle A) = 10 units\n\n### Step 1: Find the Third Angle\nFirst, we need to find the third angle, Angle C. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°.\n\n$$\nC = 180° - A - B = 180° - 30° - 45° = 105°\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Law of Sines\nThe Law of Sines states that:\n\n$$\n\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\n$$\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the lengths of sides b and c.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Side b\nUsing the Law of Sines, we can set up the equation to find side b:\n\n$$\n\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$$\n\frac{10}{\sin(30°)} = \frac{b}{\sin(45°)}\n$$\n\nSince $\sin(30°) = 0.5$ and $\sin(45°) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we can rewrite the equation:\n\n$$\n\frac{10}{0.5} = \frac{b}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n20 = \frac{b}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n$$\n\nNow, solve for b:\n\n$$\nb = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Side c\nNext, we can find side c using the same Law of Sines:\n\n$$\n\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$$\n\frac{10}{\sin(30°)} = \frac{c}{\sin(105°)}\n$$\n\nUsing $\sin(105°) = \sin(180° - 75°) = \sin(75°) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\frac{10}{0.5} = \frac{c}{\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n20 = \frac{c}{\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}}\n$$\n\nNow, solve for c:\n\n$$\nc = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} = 5(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) \approx 18.71 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Summary of Results\n- Angle A = 30°\n- Angle B = 45°\n- Angle C = 105°\n- Side a = 10 units\n- Side b ≈ 14.14 units\n- Side c ≈ 18.71 units\n\nThis example illustrates how to use the Law of Sines to solve for unknown sides and angles in a triangle when given two angles and one side.
