    How does a linear transformation affect the variance of a random variable?
answer: >-
    A linear transformation of a random variable can be expressed in the form $ Y = a + bX $, where $ a $ is a constant added to the variable, and $ b $ is a constant that scales the variable. The effects of this transformation on the variance and standard deviation of the random variable $ X $ are as follows:\n\n1. **Mean**: The mean of the transformed variable $ Y $ is given by the equation:\n   $$\n   \mu_Y = a + b\mu_X\n   $$\n   This indicates that the mean shifts by $ a $ and is scaled by $ b $.\n\n2. **Variance**: The variance of the transformed variable $ Y $ is affected by the scaling factor $ b $ as follows:\n   $$\n   \sigma_Y^2 = b^2 \sigma_X^2\n   $$\n   This means that the variance of $ Y $ is equal to the variance of $ X $ multiplied by the square of the scaling factor $ b $. Notably, the addition of a constant $ a $ does not affect the variance.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the transformed variable $ Y $ is given by:\n   $$\n   \sigma_Y = |b| \sigma_X\n   $$\n   This shows that the standard deviation is scaled by the absolute value of $ b $.\n\nIn summary, while the addition of a constant does not change the variance, the scaling of the random variable by a factor $ b $ alters the variance by a factor of $ b^2 $. Thus, linear transformations can significantly affect the spread of the distribution of a random variable, depending on the scaling factor used.
