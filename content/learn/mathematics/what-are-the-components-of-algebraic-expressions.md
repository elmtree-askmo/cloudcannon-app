    What are the components of algebraic expressions?
answer: >-
    Algebraic expressions are mathematical phrases that consist of various components, which can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Variables**: These are symbols (often letters) that represent unknown values. For example, in the expression $5x + 7$, $x$ is a variable.\n\n2. **Constants**: These are fixed numerical values that do not change. Examples include numbers like 2, 5, or $\pi$.\n\n3. **Coefficients**: These are numerical factors that multiply the variables in the expression. For instance, in the term $10a^2$, the coefficient is 10.\n\n4. **Terms**: An algebraic expression is made up of one or more terms, which can be separated by addition or subtraction. For example, in the expression $x^2y^2 + 6xy - 3$, there are three terms: $x^2y^2$, $6xy$, and $-3$.\n\n5. **Operations**: Algebraic expressions involve operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations combine the terms and components of the expression.\n\nIn summary, the main components of algebraic expressions include variables, constants, coefficients, terms, and the operations that connect them. Understanding these components is crucial for evaluating and manipulating algebraic expressions effectively.
