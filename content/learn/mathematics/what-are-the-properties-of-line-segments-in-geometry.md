    What are the properties of line segments in geometry?
answer: >-
    In geometry, line segments are fundamental components that possess several key properties. Here are the main characteristics of line segments:\n\n1. **Definition**: A line segment is a part of a straight line that is bounded by two distinct endpoints. It contains every point on the line that lies between these endpoints.\n\n2. **Endpoints**: A line segment is defined by its two endpoints, which are the starting and ending points of the segment. These endpoints help specify the exact location of the segment in space.\n\n3. **Finite Length**: Unlike a line, which extends infinitely in both directions, a line segment has a finite length that can be measured. The length of a line segment can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, which for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:\n   $$\n   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   $$\n\n4. **Closed and Open Segments**: A closed line segment includes both endpoints, while an open line segment does not include the endpoints. This distinction is important in various mathematical contexts.\n\n5. **Representation**: Line segments are often represented visually as straight lines with two endpoints marked by small dots. This representation helps in understanding their properties and relationships with other geometric figures.\n\n6. **Parallelism**: Two line segments are said to be parallel if they are in the same plane and the distance between them remains constant. For example, the opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel line segments.\n\n7. **Collinearity**: Points that lie on the same line segment are said to be collinear. This property is essential when discussing the arrangement of points in geometric figures.\n\n8. **Intersection**: Line segments can intersect with other line segments, lines, or rays, forming angles at the point of intersection.\n\nUnderstanding these properties of line segments is crucial for exploring more complex geometric concepts and applications. They serve as the building blocks for various shapes and structures in geometry.
