    To identify an arithmetic sequence, one must look for a consistent pattern in the differences between consecutive terms. An arithmetic sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant value, known as the common difference (denoted as $d$), to the previous term. \n\nHere are the steps to identify an arithmetic sequence:\n\n1. **Check the Differences**: Take two consecutive terms from the sequence and subtract the first term from the second term. Repeat this for other pairs of consecutive terms. If the difference is the same for all pairs, the sequence is arithmetic.\n\n   For example, in the sequence $1, 3, 5, 7, ...$:\n   - The difference between $3$ and $1$ is $2$.\n   - The difference between $5$ and $3$ is $2$.\n   - The difference between $7$ and $5$ is $2$.\n   Since the difference is constant, this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $2$.\n\n2. **Identify the Common Difference**: The common difference can be positive, negative, or zero, leading to increasing, decreasing, or constant sequences, respectively. \n\n3. **Formula Representation**: If $a_1$ is the first term of the sequence and $d$ is the common difference, the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed using the formula:\n   $$\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n   $$\n   This formula allows you to find any term in the sequence if you know the first term and the common difference.\n\n4. **Example of Identification**: Consider the sequence $2, 4, 6, 8, ...$:\n   - The differences are $4 - 2 = 2$, $6 - 4 = 2$, and $8 - 6 = 2$.\n   - Since the difference is constant at $2$, this confirms it is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nBy following these steps, one can effectively identify and work with arithmetic sequences.
