    To identify the vertex of a parabola from its vertex form equation, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Vertex Form**: The vertex form of a parabola is given by the equation:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   In this equation, $(h, k)$ represents the vertex of the parabola, where:\n   - $h$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex,\n   - $k$ is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n2. **Identify the Vertex**: From the vertex form equation, you can directly read off the values of $h$ and $k$. For example, if you have the equation:\n   $$\n   y = 2(x - 3)^2 + 5\n   $$\n   The vertex is at the point $(h, k) = (3, 5)$.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation**: The vertex is the point at which the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum value, depending on the sign of the coefficient $a$. If $a > 0$, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex is the minimum point. If $a < 0$, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex is the maximum point.\n\n4. **Example**: For the equation $y = -4(x + 2)^2 + 1$, the vertex can be identified as follows:\n   - Here, $h = -2$ and $k = 1$, so the vertex is at the point $(-2, 1)$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily identify the vertex of a parabola from its vertex form equation.
