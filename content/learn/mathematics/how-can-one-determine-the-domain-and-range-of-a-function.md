answer: >-
    To determine the domain and range of a function, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Domain\nThe domain of a function refers to the set of all possible input values (typically x-values) that the function can accept. Here are some methods to find the domain:\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach**: For functions defined by an equation, identify any restrictions on the input values. For example, if the function involves a fraction, set the denominator not equal to zero. For instance, for the function \( f(x) = \frac{x+1}{2-x} \), the domain is found by solving \( 2 - x \neq 0 \), which gives \( x \neq 2 \). Thus, the domain is \( (-\infty, 2) \cup (2, \infty) \).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach**: You can also determine the domain by examining the graph of the function. Look for any breaks, holes, or vertical asymptotes that indicate values of x that are not included in the domain.\n\n### Range\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (typically y-values) that the function can produce. Finding the range can be more complex than finding the domain. Here are some methods:\n\n1. **Vertex Method for Quadratic Functions**: For a quadratic function in the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), you can find the vertex using the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Plug this x-value back into the function to find the corresponding y-value, which gives you the vertex. Depending on the direction of the parabola (opening upwards or downwards), you can determine the range. For example, if the vertex is at \( (h, k) \) and the parabola opens upwards, the range is \( [k, \infty) \).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach**: Similar to the domain, you can also find the range by looking at the graph of the function. Identify the lowest and highest points on the graph (if they exist) to determine the range. \n\n3. **Set-builder and Interval Notation**: When expressing the range, you can use interval notation (e.g., \( [k, \infty) \)) or set-builder notation (e.g., \( \{y | y \geq k\} \)) to clearly define the output values.\n\n### Example\nFor the function \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n- **Domain**: All real numbers, \( (-\infty, \infty) \).\n- **Range**: All non-negative real numbers, \( [0, \infty) \).\n\nIn summary, to find the domain and range of a function, analyze the function algebraically and graphically, considering any restrictions on input values for the domain and the possible output values for the range.
