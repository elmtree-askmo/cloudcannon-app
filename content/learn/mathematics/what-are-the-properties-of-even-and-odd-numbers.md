    What are the properties of even and odd numbers?
answer: >-
    The properties of even and odd numbers are fundamental concepts in mathematics that help in various calculations and problem-solving scenarios. Here are the key properties:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Even Numbers**: An integer is classified as even if it can be expressed in the form $ n = 2k $, where $ k $ is an integer. Examples include 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.\n   - **Odd Numbers**: An integer is classified as odd if it can be expressed in the form $ n = 2k + 1 $, where $ k $ is an integer. Examples include 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\n2. **Addition**:\n   - The sum of two even numbers is always even: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} + \text{even} = \text{even} \n     $$\n   - The sum of two odd numbers is also even: \n     $$ \n     \text{odd} + \text{odd} = \text{even} \n     $$\n   - The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} + \text{odd} = \text{odd} \n     $$\n\n3. **Subtraction**:\n   - The difference between two odd numbers is even: \n     $$ \n     \text{odd} - \text{odd} = \text{even} \n     $$\n   - The difference between an even number and an odd number is odd: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} - \text{odd} = \text{odd} \n     $$\n   - The difference between an even number and an even number is even: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} - \text{even} = \text{even} \n     $$\n\n4. **Multiplication**:\n   - The product of two even numbers is even: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} \times \text{even} = \text{even} \n     $$\n   - The product of an even number and an odd number is even: \n     $$ \n     \text{even} \times \text{odd} = \text{even} \n     $$\n   - The product of two odd numbers is odd: \n     $$ \n     \text{odd} \times \text{odd} = \text{odd} \n     $$\n\n5. **Last Digit Check**:\n   - An even number will always end in one of the digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n   - An odd number will always end in one of the digits: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\n6. **Zero**:\n   - Zero (0) is considered an even number.\n\nThese properties are not only essential for basic arithmetic but also play a significant role in more advanced mathematical concepts and proofs. Understanding these properties can aid in simplifying calculations and solving equations efficiently.
