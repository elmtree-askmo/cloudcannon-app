    What is a periodic function and how is it defined?
answer: >-
    A periodic function is defined as a function that repeats its values at regular intervals, known as periods. Mathematically, a function \( f(x) \) is considered periodic if there exists a positive constant $ p $ (the period) such that:\n\n$$\nf(x + p) = f(x)\n$$\n\nfor all values of $ x $. This means that after every interval of length $ p $, the function returns to the same value.\n\nCommon examples of periodic functions include trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine, which have a period of $ 2\pi $. Other examples include square waves, triangular waves, and sawtooth waves. The concept of periodicity is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and signal processing, as it helps in analyzing oscillatory motions and waveforms.\n\nIn summary, periodic functions are characterized by their repetitive nature, and understanding their properties is essential for further studies in Fourier series and other mathematical applications.
