    The distributive property of the scalar product states that the dot product distributes over vector addition, expressed as \( \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} \). This property is essential for simplifying calculations involving vectors.

answer: >-
    The distributive property of the scalar product, also known as the dot product, states that the scalar product distributes over vector addition. This means that for any vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, the following relationship holds:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c}.\n$$\n\nThis property is essential for simplifying expressions involving dot products and is one of the fundamental properties of the scalar product. It allows us to break down the scalar product of a vector with a sum of vectors into the sum of the scalar products of the vector with each individual vector. \n\nFor example, if we have vectors \(\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)\), \(\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)\), and \(\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, c_3)\), we can express the distributive property as follows:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} = a_1(b_1 + c_1) + a_2(b_2 + c_2) + a_3(b_3 + c_3).\n$$\n\nThis property is particularly useful in vector algebra and physics, where it simplifies calculations involving multiple vectors.
