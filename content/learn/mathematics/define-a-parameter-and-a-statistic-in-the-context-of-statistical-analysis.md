    Define a parameter and a statistic in the context of statistical analysis.
answer: >-
    In the context of statistical analysis, a **parameter** and a **statistic** are defined as follows:\n\n- **Parameter**: A parameter is a numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population. It is a fixed value that is often unknown because it is typically impractical or impossible to measure the entire population. For example, the average height of all adult men in a city is a parameter.\n\n- **Statistic**: A statistic, on the other hand, is a numerical value that describes a characteristic of a sample drawn from the population. Statistics are calculated from the sample data and are used to estimate the unknown parameters. For instance, if you take a sample of 100 men from the city and calculate their average height, that average is a statistic.\n\nIn summary, parameters refer to the whole population, while statistics refer to the sample. Statistics are often used to make inferences about parameters.
