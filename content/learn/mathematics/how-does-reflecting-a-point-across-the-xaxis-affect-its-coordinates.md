    How does reflecting a point across the x-axis affect its coordinates?
answer: >-
    Reflecting a point across the x-axis affects its coordinates by negating the y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate unchanged. \n\nMathematically, if you have a point $ P $ with coordinates \( (x, y) \), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new coordinates $ P' $ will be:\n\n$$\nP' = (x, -y)\n$$\n\nThis means that the point is flipped vertically over the x-axis. For example, if you start with the point \( P(2, 3) \), after reflection across the x-axis, the new point $ P' $ will be \( P'(2, -3) \).\n\nIn summary, the transformation can be described as follows:\n- The x-coordinate remains the same.\n- The y-coordinate is multiplied by $-1$. \n\nThis transformation results in a mirror image of the original point with respect to the x-axis.
