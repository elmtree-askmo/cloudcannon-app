    What are the different types of combinatorial formulas?
answer: >-
    In combinatorics, there are several key types of combinatorial formulas that are used to count arrangements and selections of objects. Here are the main types:\n\n1. **Permutations**: This refers to the arrangement of objects where the order matters. The formula for permutations of $ n $ distinct objects taken $ r $ at a time is given by:\n   $$\n   P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\n   $$\n   where $ n! $ (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to $ n $.\n\n2. **Combinations**: This refers to the selection of objects where the order does not matter. The formula for combinations of $ n $ distinct objects taken $ r $ at a time is:\n   $$\n   C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\n   $$\n   This is often referred to as "n choose r" and is also known as the binomial coefficient.\n\n3. **Factorials**: Factorials are foundational in combinatorics, as they are used in both permutations and combinations. The factorial of a non-negative integer $ n $ is defined as:\n   $$\n   n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \ldots \times 1\n   $$\n   with $ 0! = 1 $.\n\n4. **Counting Principles**: These include various methods for counting arrangements and selections, such as the multiplication principle, which states that if one event can occur in $ m $ ways and a second can occur independently in $ n $ ways, then the two events can occur in $ m \times n $ ways.\n\n5. **Specific Cases of Combinations**: There are also specific cases of combinations, such as combinations with repetition, where the same object can be chosen more than once. The formula for combinations with repetition is:\n   $$\n   C(n + r - 1, r) = \frac{(n + r - 1)!}{r!(n - 1)!}\n   $$\n\n6. **Multinomial Coefficients**: These generalize combinations to more than two groups. The multinomial coefficient for dividing $ n $ objects into $ k $ groups of sizes $ n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k $ is given by:\n   $$\n   \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \ldots n_k!}\n   $$\n\nThese combinatorial formulas are essential in various fields, including probability theory, computer science, and statistics, as they help in calculating the total number of possible outcomes in different scenarios.
