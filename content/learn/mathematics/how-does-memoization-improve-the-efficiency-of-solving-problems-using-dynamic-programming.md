    How does memoization improve the efficiency of solving problems using dynamic programming?
answer: >-
    Memoization is a powerful optimization technique used in dynamic programming to enhance the efficiency of solving problems, particularly those that can be defined recursively. Here’s how memoization improves efficiency:\n\n### 1. Avoiding Redundant Calculations\nIn many recursive algorithms, especially those that solve problems with overlapping subproblems (like the Fibonacci sequence), the same calculations are performed multiple times. Memoization addresses this by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This significantly reduces the number of computations.\n\nFor example, in the Fibonacci sequence, the naive recursive approach has an exponential time complexity of $O(2^n)$ because it recalculates Fibonacci numbers for the same indices multiple times. By using memoization, the time complexity can be reduced to $O(n)$, as each Fibonacci number is computed only once.\n\n### 2. Space Complexity Considerations\nWhile memoization improves time complexity, it does require additional space to store the results of subproblems. The space complexity is typically $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the input. This trade-off between time and space is often acceptable, especially when the time savings are substantial.\n\n### 3. Implementation Example\nHere’s a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using memoization in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fib(n, memo={}):\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n```\n\nIn this code, the `memo` dictionary stores previously computed Fibonacci numbers. When the function is called with a number that has already been computed, it retrieves the result from `memo` instead of recalculating it.\n\n### 4. Application in Dynamic Programming Problems\nMemoization is particularly useful in various dynamic programming problems, such as:\n\n- **Coin Change Problem**: Where you can store the number of ways to make change for each amount.\n- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Where you can store the results of subproblems to avoid recalculating them.\n- **Knapsack Problem**: Where you can store the maximum value that can be obtained for each weight limit.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, memoization enhances the efficiency of dynamic programming by eliminating redundant calculations through the storage of previously computed results. This leads to significant improvements in time complexity, making it feasible to solve larger instances of problems that would otherwise be computationally expensive.
