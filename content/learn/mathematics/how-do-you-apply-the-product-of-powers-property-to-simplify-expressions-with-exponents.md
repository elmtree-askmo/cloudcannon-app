answer: >-
    To apply the product of powers property to simplify expressions with exponents, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Base**: Ensure that the terms you are multiplying have the same base. The product of powers property applies only when the bases are identical.\n\n2. **Add the Exponents**: According to the product of powers rule, when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add their exponents. The formula for this rule is:\n   $$\n   B^m \cdot B^n = B^{m+n}\n   $$\n   where $ B $ is the base, and $ m $ and $ n $ are the exponents.\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression**: After adding the exponents, rewrite the expression using the new exponent.\n\n### Example\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this process:\n\nSuppose you want to simplify the expression $ 3^4 \cdot 3^2 $.\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the base: The base is $ 3 $.\n- **Step 2**: Add the exponents: $ 4 + 2 = 6 $.\n- **Step 3**: Rewrite the expression: \n  $$\n  3^4 \cdot 3^2 = 3^{4+2} = 3^6\n  $$\n\n### Additional Example\nAnother example could be $ x^3 \cdot x^5 $.\n\n- **Step 1**: The base is $ x $.\n- **Step 2**: Add the exponents: $ 3 + 5 = 8 $.\n- **Step 3**: Rewrite the expression:\n  $$\n  x^3 \cdot x^5 = x^{3+5} = x^8\n  $$\n\n### Summary\nThe product of powers property is a fundamental rule in exponentiation that allows for the simplification of expressions by adding exponents when multiplying like bases. This property is essential for working with polynomial expressions and can significantly streamline calculations in algebra.
