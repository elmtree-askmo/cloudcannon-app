    What are the three main types of transformations in geometry?
answer: >-
    The three main types of transformations in geometry are:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation involves moving a geometric figure from one location to another without altering its shape, size, or orientation. Every point of the figure is shifted the same distance in a specified direction. For example, if you slide a triangle to the right, it remains congruent to its original position.\n\n2. **Reflection**: In this transformation, a figure is flipped over a specific line, known as the line of reflection, creating a mirror image of the original figure. For instance, reflecting a point across the x-axis will change the sign of its y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate unchanged. This results in a symmetrical image relative to the line of reflection.\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation involves turning a figure around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation, by a certain angle in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. For example, rotating a square 90 degrees around its center will change its orientation but not its size or shape.\n\nWhile there are additional transformations such as dilation and shear, the three mentioned above—translation, reflection, and rotation—are the fundamental types that form the basis for understanding geometric transformations.
