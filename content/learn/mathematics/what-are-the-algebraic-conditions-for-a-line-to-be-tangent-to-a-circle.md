    What are the algebraic conditions for a line to be tangent to a circle?
answer: >-
    For a line to be tangent to a circle, certain algebraic conditions must be satisfied. These conditions can be derived from the equations of the circle and the line, as well as the properties of quadratic equations.\n\n1. **Equation of the Circle**: The standard form of a circle's equation is given by:\n   $$\n   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n   $$\n   where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\n2. **Equation of the Line**: The equation of a line can be expressed in slope-intercept form as:\n   $$\n   y = mx + b\n   $$\n   where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n3. **Substituting the Line's Equation into the Circle's Equation**: To find the points of intersection between the line and the circle, substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the circle. This results in a quadratic equation in the form:\n   $$\n   Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n   $$\n   where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are coefficients derived from the substitution.\n\n4. **Discriminant Condition**: The nature of the intersection can be determined using the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by:\n   $$\n   D = B^2 - 4AC\n   $$\n   - If $D > 0$, the line intersects the circle at two points.\n   - If $D = 0$, the line is tangent to the circle, touching it at exactly one point.\n   - If $D < 0$, the line does not intersect the circle at all.\n\nThus, the algebraic condition for a line to be tangent to a circle is that the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation must equal zero:\n$$\nB^2 - 4AC = 0\n$$\n\nThis condition ensures that there is exactly one solution to the equation, indicating that the line touches the circle at a single point, which is the definition of a tangent line.
