    How do you find the maximum and minimum values of a function on a closed interval?
answer: >-
    To find the maximum and minimum values of a function on a closed interval $[a, b]$, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function and Interval**: Start with a function \( f(x) \) defined on the closed interval $[a, b]$.\n\n2. **Find the First Derivative**: Compute the first derivative of the function, \( f'(x) \). This derivative will help identify the critical points where the function may have local maxima or minima.\n\n3. **Determine Critical Points**: Set the first derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n   $$ \n   f'(x) = 0 \n   $$\n   Solve for $ x $ to find the critical points $ c $ within the interval $[a, b]$.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Function at Critical Points**: Calculate the function values at each critical point $ c $:\n   $$ \n   f(c) \n   $$\n\n5. **Evaluate the Function at the Endpoints**: Also calculate the function values at the endpoints of the interval:\n   $$ \n   f(a) \quad \text{and} \quad f(b) \n   $$\n\n6. **Compare Values**: Collect all the function values obtained from the critical points and the endpoints. The largest value among these will be the absolute maximum, and the smallest will be the absolute minimum.\n\n### Example\nConsider the function \( f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5 \) on the interval $[1, 5]$:\n\n1. **First Derivative**: \n   $$ \n   f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12 \n   $$\n\n2. **Critical Points**: Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):\n   $$ \n   6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0 \n   $$\n   Simplifying gives:\n   $$ \n   x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \n   $$\n   Factoring results in:\n   $$ \n   (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0 \n   $$\n   Thus, the critical points are $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 2 $.\n\n3. **Evaluate at Critical Points**:\n   - \( f(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 5 = 10 \)\n   - \( f(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 5 = 5 \)\n\n4. **Evaluate at Endpoints**:\n   - \( f(1) = 10 \) (already calculated)\n   - \( f(5) = 2(5)^3 - 9(5)^2 + 12(5) + 5 = 70 \)\n\n5. **Compare Values**:\n   - \( f(1) = 10 \)\n   - \( f(2) = 5 \)\n   - \( f(5) = 70 \)\n\nFrom these evaluations, the absolute maximum value is $ 70 $ at $ x = 5 $, and the absolute minimum value is $ 5 $ at $ x = 2 $.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the maximum and minimum values of a function on a closed interval.
