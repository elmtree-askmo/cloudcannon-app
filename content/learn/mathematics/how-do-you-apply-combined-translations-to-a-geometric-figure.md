    To apply combined translations to a geometric figure, you need to follow a systematic approach that involves determining the new positions of key points in the figure based on the translation rules. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Understand the Translation Rules**: A translation moves every point of a geometric figure a certain distance in a specified direction. In the coordinate plane, a translation can be represented as:\n   - Horizontal translation: $(x, y) \to (x + a, y)$, where $a$ is the distance moved along the x-axis.\n   - Vertical translation: $(x, y) \to (x, y + b)$, where $b$ is the distance moved along the y-axis.\n\n2. **Identify the Key Points**: Determine the coordinates of the key points of the geometric figure you want to translate. For example, if you have a triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(3, 4), and C(5, 1), these points will be your starting coordinates.\n\n3. **Apply the First Translation**: If you have multiple translations, start with the first one. For instance, if the first translation is to move the figure 3 units to the right and 2 units up, you would apply the following transformations:\n   - A(1, 2) becomes A'(1 + 3, 2 + 2) = A'(4, 4)\n   - B(3, 4) becomes B'(3 + 3, 4 + 2) = B'(6, 6)\n   - C(5, 1) becomes C'(5 + 3, 1 + 2) = C'(8, 3)\n\n4. **Apply the Second Translation**: If there is a second translation, apply it to the new coordinates obtained from the first translation. For example, if the second translation is to move the figure 1 unit to the left and 3 units down, you would perform:\n   - A'(4, 4) becomes A''(4 - 1, 4 - 3) = A''(3, 1)\n   - B'(6, 6) becomes B''(6 - 1, 6 - 3) = B''(5, 3)\n   - C'(8, 3) becomes C''(8 - 1, 3 - 3) = C''(7, 0)\n\n5. **Plot the New Figure**: After applying all translations, plot the new coordinates on the coordinate plane. Connect the points to form the translated geometric figure.\n\n6. **Check for Congruence**: Ensure that the original and the translated figures are congruent, meaning they have the same shape and size, just in different positions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively apply combined translations to any geometric figure, ensuring that you maintain the integrity of the figure while changing its position in the coordinate system.
