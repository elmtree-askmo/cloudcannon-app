    What is the line of reflection in a reflection transformation?
answer: >-
    In a reflection transformation, the line of reflection is a crucial element that serves as the axis around which the figure is flipped to create its mirror image. This line can be thought of as a "mirror" that divides the original figure and its reflected image into two congruent halves.\n\nKey characteristics of the line of reflection include:\n\n1. **Positioning**: The line of reflection lies equidistant from corresponding points of the original figure and its reflected image. For any point on the original figure, the reflected point will be located on the opposite side of the line at the same distance.\n\n2. **Rigid Transformation**: Reflection is classified as a rigid transformation, meaning that the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged during the process. The original figure and its reflection are congruent.\n\n3. **Orientation**: The orientation of the figure changes during reflection. For instance, if the original figure is oriented in a certain direction, its reflection will be oriented in the opposite direction.\n\n4. **Examples**: If a triangle is reflected over a vertical line, such as $x = 4$, the resulting triangle will be positioned symmetrically on the opposite side of the line, maintaining the same size and shape.\n\nIn summary, the line of reflection is the axis that facilitates the flipping of a geometric figure to produce a mirror image, ensuring that corresponding points are equidistant from this line and that the overall properties of the figure remain intact.
