    What is the line of reflection in a reflection transformation?
answer: >-
    In a reflection transformation, the line of reflection (also known as the mirror line) is the line across which a geometric figure or point is flipped to create its mirror image. This line serves as a boundary that divides the original figure and its reflected image into two congruent parts, meaning they are identical in shape and size but oriented in opposite directions.\n\nThe line of reflection can be any straight line in the coordinate plane, but common examples include:\n\n1. **X-axis**: When reflecting over the x-axis, each point \((a, b)\) of the figure is transformed to \((a, -b)\). The x-axis acts as the line of reflection, and the image is flipped vertically.\n\n2. **Y-axis**: When reflecting over the y-axis, each point \((a, b)\) is transformed to \((-a, b)\). Here, the y-axis serves as the line of reflection, and the image is flipped horizontally.\n\n3. **Line $y = x$**: When reflecting over the line $y = x$, each point \((a, b)\) is transformed to \((b, a)\). This line acts as the diagonal line of reflection, swapping the x and y coordinates.\n\n4. **Line $y = -x$**: When reflecting over the line $y = -x$, each point \((a, b)\) is transformed to \((-b, -a)\). This line also serves as a diagonal line of reflection, but it flips the coordinates and their signs.\n\nTo determine the line of reflection between two congruent figures, one can calculate the midpoint of corresponding points from each figure. The line of reflection will pass through these midpoints, effectively bisecting the distance between the original points and their images.\n\nIn summary, the line of reflection is crucial in understanding how reflections work in geometry, as it defines the axis about which the transformation occurs, ensuring that the original figure and its image maintain congruence.
