    How can students check their work when multiplying decimals?
answer: >-
    Students can check their work when multiplying decimals by following a few systematic steps:\n\n1. **Recalculate the Product**: After obtaining the initial product, students should multiply the decimals again using the same method to verify their answer. This can help catch any mistakes made during the first calculation.\n\n2. **Count Decimal Places**: When multiplying decimals, students should ensure that the number of decimal places in the product matches the total number of decimal places in the factors. For example, if multiplying 0.39 (two decimal places) by 5.6 (one decimal place), the product should have three decimal places.\n\n3. **Use Estimation**: Students can round the decimal numbers to the nearest whole number or one decimal place to estimate the expected range of the product. This provides a quick way to check if the calculated product is reasonable. For instance, rounding 0.39 to 0.4 and 5.6 to 6 gives an estimated product of 2.4, which can help verify the accuracy of the actual product.\n\n4. **Convert to Fractions**: Another method is to convert the decimal numbers into fractions, perform the multiplication, and then convert back to decimals. This can provide a different perspective on the calculation and help confirm the result.\n\n5. **Use a Calculator**: If allowed, students can use a calculator to check their work. This is particularly useful for more complex decimal multiplications.\n\nBy employing these strategies, students can effectively verify their calculations and ensure accuracy when multiplying decimals.
