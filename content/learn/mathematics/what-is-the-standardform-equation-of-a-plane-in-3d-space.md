    What is the standard-form equation of a plane in 3-D space?
answer: >-
    The standard-form equation of a plane in three-dimensional space can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nax + by + cz + d = 0\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients that correspond to the components of a normal vector \(\vec{n} = (a, b, c)\) to the plane. The constant $d$ can be calculated using a point \((x_0, y_0, z_0)\) that lies on the plane, such that:\n\n$$\nd = - (ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0)\n$$\n\nThis form is useful because it provides a clear representation of the plane's orientation in three-dimensional space. Additionally, the equation can also be derived from the point-normal form, which states that for a plane passing through a point \(P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)\) with a normal vector \(\vec{n} = (a, b, c)\), the equation can be written as:\n\n$$\na(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0\n$$\n\nBy rearranging this equation, you can arrive at the standard form mentioned above. This standard form is widely used in geometry, physics, and engineering to describe planes in three-dimensional space.
