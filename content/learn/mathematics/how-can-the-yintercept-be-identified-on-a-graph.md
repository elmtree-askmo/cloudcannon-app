    How can the y-intercept be identified on a graph?
answer: >-
    The y-intercept of a function can be identified on a graph as the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. This occurs specifically when the independent variable $ x $ is equal to zero. \n\nTo find the y-intercept algebraically, you can substitute $ x = 0 $ into the function's equation. For example, in the linear function $ y = 2x + 3 $, substituting $ x = 0 $ gives:\n\n$$\ny = 2(0) + 3 = 3\n$$\n\nThus, the y-intercept is the point \( (0, 3) \) on the graph.\n\nIn graphical representation, the y-intercept is typically marked as a point on the y-axis, and it can be visually identified as the point where the line or curve intersects the y-axis. For linear equations in slope-intercept form, $ y = mx + b $, the y-intercept is represented by the constant $ b $. \n\nIn summary, to identify the y-intercept on a graph:\n1. Locate the point where the graph intersects the y-axis.\n2. Confirm that this point corresponds to $ x = 0 $.\n3. The coordinates of this point will be in the form \( (0, y) \), where $ y $ is the value obtained from substituting $ x = 0 $ into the function.
