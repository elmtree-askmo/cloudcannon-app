    What are the key differences between normal and skewed distributions in statistical analysis?
answer: >-
    The key differences between normal and skewed distributions in statistical analysis are as follows:\n\n### Normal Distribution\n1. **Shape**: A normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. The left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images of each other.\n2. **Central Tendency**: In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n3. **Variability**: The spread of the data is determined by the standard deviation. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% within three standard deviations (known as the empirical rule).\n4. **Statistical Inference**: Many statistical tests assume normality, making it easier to apply inferential statistics, such as t-tests and ANOVA.\n\n### Skewed Distribution\n1. **Shape**: A skewed distribution is not symmetric. It can be positively skewed (right-skewed) or negatively skewed (left-skewed). In a positively skewed distribution, the tail on the right side is longer or fatter, while in a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left side is longer or fatter.\n2. **Central Tendency**: In skewed distributions, the mean, median, and mode are not equal. The mean is pulled in the direction of the skew. For example, in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, which is greater than the mode.\n3. **Variability**: The presence of outliers can significantly affect the mean and standard deviation, making interpretation more complex. The spread of the data may not follow the empirical rule as closely as in a normal distribution.\n4. **Statistical Inference**: Many statistical tests may not be valid for skewed data without transformation or non-parametric alternatives, as they often assume normality.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the main differences lie in the shape, central tendency, variability, and implications for statistical analysis. Normal distributions facilitate the use of parametric statistical methods, while skewed distributions may require alternative approaches to accurately interpret the data. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective data analysis and interpretation in research.
