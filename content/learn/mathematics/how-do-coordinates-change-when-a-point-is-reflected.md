    How do coordinates change when a point is reflected?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across an axis, its coordinates change based on the axis of reflection. Hereâ€™s how the coordinates change for reflections across the x-axis and y-axis:\n\n### Reflection Across the X-Axis\nWhen reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the x-axis, the new coordinates become:\n$$\nP' = (x, -y)\n$$\nThis means that the x-coordinate remains unchanged, while the y-coordinate is negated. For example, if you have a point \(P(2, 3)\), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new point $P'$ will be:\n$$\nP' = (2, -3)\n$$\n\n### Reflection Across the Y-Axis\nWhen reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the y-axis, the new coordinates become:\n$$\nP' = (-x, y)\n$$\nIn this case, the y-coordinate remains unchanged, while the x-coordinate is negated. For instance, if you have a point \(P(2, 3)\), after reflecting it across the y-axis, the new point $P'$ will be:\n$$\nP' = (-2, 3)\n$$\n\n### Summary\n- **Reflection across the x-axis**: Changes the sign of the y-coordinate.\n  - Example: \(P(2, 3) \rightarrow P'(2, -3)\)\n  \n- **Reflection across the y-axis**: Changes the sign of the x-coordinate.\n  - Example: \(P(2, 3) \rightarrow P'(-2, 3)\)\n\nThese transformations are fundamental in understanding geometric figures and their symmetries in the coordinate plane.
