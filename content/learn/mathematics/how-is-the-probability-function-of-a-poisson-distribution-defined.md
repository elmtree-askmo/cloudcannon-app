    How is the probability function of a Poisson distribution defined?
answer: >-
    The probability function of a Poisson distribution is defined by the probability mass function (PMF), which expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. If a random variable \( X \) follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \( \lambda \) (lambda), which represents the average number of events in the interval, the probability that \( X \) equals \( k \) (the number of events) is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nP(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}\n$$\n\nIn this formula:\n- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828),\n- \( \lambda \) is the average rate (mean) of occurrence of the event,\n- \( k \) is the actual number of events that occur (where \( k \) can take values 0, 1, 2, ...),\n- \( k! \) is the factorial of \( k \).\n\nThis distribution is particularly useful for modeling the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval when these events happen independently and with a known constant mean rate.
