    What strategies can be used to rearrange algebraic expressions?
answer: >-
    To rearrange algebraic expressions effectively, several strategies can be employed. These strategies are often similar to those used when solving equations for a particular variable. Here are some key methods:\n\n1. **Using Inverse Operations**: The fundamental principle of rearranging expressions is to use inverse operations. For example, if you have an equation like $ y = 2x + 4 $ and you want to make $ x $ the subject, you would first subtract 4 from both sides and then divide by 2:\n   $$\n   y - 4 = 2x \implies x = \frac{y - 4}{2}\n   $$\n\n2. **Moving Terms Across the Equation**: When rearranging, you can move terms from one side of the equation to the other. This involves changing the sign of the term being moved. For instance, if you have $ x + 3 = 7 $, you can rearrange it to $ x = 7 - 3 $.\n\n3. **Rearranging Variables**: To change the subject of a formula, you can rearrange the variables. For example, in the equation $ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $, if you want to make $ a $ the subject, you would isolate $ a $ by first moving the other terms to the opposite side and then solving for $ a $.\n\n4. **Applying the Distributive Property**: When dealing with expressions that involve parentheses, you can use the distributive property to expand them. For example, in \( a(b + c) \), you can rewrite it as $ ab + ac $.\n\n5. **Combining Like Terms**: When rearranging, it is often helpful to combine like terms. This means grouping terms that have the same variable and exponent. For example, in the expression $ 3x + 5x - 2 $, you can combine $ 3x $ and $ 5x $ to get $ 8x - 2 $.\n\n6. **Rearranging Complex Expressions**: For more complex expressions, you may need to factor or simplify before rearranging. For instance, if you have $ x^2 + 6x - 5 $, you can factor it to \( (x + 5)(x - 1) \) to make further rearrangements easier.\n\n7. **Order of Operations**: Always remember the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when rearranging expressions. This ensures that you perform operations in the correct sequence, which is crucial for maintaining the equality of the expression.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can effectively rearrange algebraic expressions to isolate variables or change the subject of formulas as needed.
