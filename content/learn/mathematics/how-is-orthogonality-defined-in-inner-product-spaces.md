    How is orthogonality defined in inner product spaces?
answer: >-
    In the context of inner product spaces, orthogonality is defined using the inner product itself. Specifically, two vectors $ \mathbf{u} $ and $ \mathbf{v} $ in an inner product space $ V $ are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is zero. This is mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\n\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0\n$$\n\nHere, $ \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle $ denotes the inner product operation. The condition of orthogonality implies that the vectors are at a right angle (90 degrees) to each other in the geometric sense, extending the concept of perpendicularity from Euclidean spaces to more abstract vector spaces.\n\nOrthogonality is a symmetric relationship, meaning if $ \mathbf{u} $ is orthogonal to $ \mathbf{v} $, then $ \mathbf{v} $ is also orthogonal to $ \mathbf{u} $. Furthermore, the concept of orthogonality can be extended to sets of vectors. A set of vectors is considered orthogonal if every pair of distinct vectors in the set is orthogonal to each other.\n\nIn addition, the orthogonal complement of a subset $ X $ of $ V $ is defined as the set of all vectors in $ V $ that are orthogonal to every vector in $ X $. This concept is crucial in various applications of linear algebra, including projections and decompositions in vector spaces. \n\nOverall, orthogonality in inner product spaces allows for the generalization of geometric concepts such as angles and distances, facilitating a deeper understanding of vector relationships in higher dimensions.
