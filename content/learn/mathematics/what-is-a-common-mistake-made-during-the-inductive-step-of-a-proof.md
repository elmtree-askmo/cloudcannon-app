    What is a common mistake made during the inductive step of a proof?
answer: >-
    A common mistake made during the inductive step of a proof by induction is failing to correctly apply the inductive hypothesis. Specifically, this can manifest in several ways:\n\n1. **Incorrect Application of the Inductive Hypothesis**: The inductive hypothesis assumes that the statement is true for a particular integer $ n $ (denoted as \( P(n) \)). A mistake occurs if the proof does not properly use this assumption to show that \( P(n+1) \) is also true. For example, if the proof relies on \( P(n) \) but does not logically connect it to \( P(n+1) \), the inductive step may fail.\n\n2. **Omitting the Base Case**: While this is not strictly part of the inductive step, omitting the base case can lead to incorrect conclusions. The base case establishes the foundation for the induction process, and without it, the entire proof lacks validity. For instance, if one were to skip proving \( P(1) \) in a proof that starts from $ n=1 $, the proof would not be complete.\n\n3. **Reversing the Implication**: Another common error is reversing the implication in the inductive step. The correct approach is to show that if \( P(n) \) is true, then \( P(n+1) \) must also be true. If one mistakenly assumes that \( P(n+1) \) being true implies \( P(n) \) is true, the proof will not hold.\n\n4. **Writing an Inductive Step that Fails for Certain Values**: Sometimes, the inductive step may be written in a way that does not hold for all integers $ n $. For example, if the proof only works for even integers but is claimed to be true for all integers, this is a significant flaw.\n\n5. **Using a Predicate that is Not Well-defined**: The statement \( P(n) \) must be a well-defined predicate. If it is not clearly defined or if it changes during the proof, the validity of the inductive step can be compromised.\n\nIn summary, careful attention must be paid to the inductive hypothesis and the logical flow from \( P(n) \) to \( P(n+1) \) to ensure the proof by induction is valid.
