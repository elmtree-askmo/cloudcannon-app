    How do you define a linear equation?
answer: >-
    A linear equation is defined as an algebraic equation that represents a straight line when graphed on a coordinate plane. More specifically, it is an equation where each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable, and it is characterized by having the highest degree of one. This means that the variables in a linear equation are not raised to any power greater than one, nor are they involved in any non-linear operations such as squares, cubes, or trigonometric functions.\n\nFor example, the equation $y = 6x + 2$ is a linear equation because it can be expressed in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope is 6, indicating that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by 6 units. \n\nLinear equations can also be represented in various forms, including:\n- **Slope-Intercept Form**: $y = mx + b$\n- **Standard Form**: $Ax + By = C$\n- **Point-Slope Form**: \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\)\n\nThese forms allow for different ways to express and manipulate linear equations, making them fundamental in algebra and various applications in mathematics and science. \n\nIn summary, a linear equation is an equation of degree one that, when graphed, produces a straight line, and it can be expressed in multiple forms to facilitate understanding and application.
