    How do the domain and range of cube root functions compare to those of square root functions?
answer: >-
    The domain and range of cube root functions differ significantly from those of square root functions.\n\n### Cube Root Functions\n- **Function Form:** \( g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \)\n- **Domain:** The domain of cube root functions is all real numbers, denoted as \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This means that you can input any real number into the function.\n- **Range:** The range is also all real numbers, \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This indicates that the output can be any real number, including both positive and negative values.\n\n### Square Root Functions\n- **Function Form:** \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \)\n- **Domain:** The domain of square root functions is limited to non-negative numbers, represented as \( [0, \infty) \). This means that the function is only defined for $ x \geq 0 $.\n- **Range:** The range is also limited to non-negative numbers, \( [0, \infty) \). Therefore, the output of the function is always zero or positive.\n\n### Comparison\n- **Domain:**\n  - Cube Root: \( (-\infty, \infty) \)\n  - Square Root: \( [0, \infty) \)\n\n- **Range:**\n  - Cube Root: \( (-\infty, \infty) \)\n  - Square Root: \( [0, \infty) \)\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Continuity:** Cube root functions are continuous and defined for all real numbers, while square root functions are only defined for non-negative inputs.\n2. **Graph Behavior:** The graph of a cube root function is symmetric about the origin and extends into all four quadrants. In contrast, the graph of a square root function starts at the origin and only exists in the first quadrant, increasing as $ x $ increases.\n\nIn summary, cube root functions allow for a broader set of inputs and outputs compared to square root functions, making them more versatile in mathematical modeling and analysis.
