    What defines a vector space and its subspaces?
answer: >-
    In linear algebra, a vector space is defined as a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vectors, along with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. These operations must satisfy specific properties, known as the vector space axioms, which include closure under addition and scalar multiplication, the existence of a zero vector, and the existence of additive inverses.\n\nA subset $ W $ of a vector space $ V $ is called a subspace of $ V $ if it itself forms a vector space under the same operations defined on $ V $. For $ W $ to be considered a subspace, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. **Non-emptiness**: The zero vector of the parent space $ V $ must be included in $ W $.\n2. **Closure under addition**: For any two vectors $ u $ and $ v $ in $ W $, the sum $ u + v $ must also be in $ W $.\n3. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any vector $ u $ in $ W $ and any scalar $ c $, the product $ c \cdot u $ must also be in $ W $.\n\nThese properties ensure that $ W $ retains the structure of a vector space. The theorem stating that subspaces are vector spaces confirms that if a subset $ W $ meets these criteria, it is indeed a vector space in its own right.\n\nFor example, consider the set of all quadratic polynomials of the form $ ax^2 + bx + c $, where $ a, b, $ and $ c $ are real numbers. This set forms a vector space under polynomial addition and scalar multiplication. A subspace of this vector space could be the set of all polynomials where $ a = 0 $, which consists of linear polynomials $ bx + c $.\n\nIn summary, a vector space is defined by its vectors and operations, while a subspace is a subset of that vector space that also satisfies the vector space properties under the same operations.
