    How do you apply integration rules to bracketed expressions with a coefficient of x?
answer: >-
    To apply integration rules to bracketed expressions with a coefficient of $x$, you can follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using the integration rules and techniques mentioned in the gathered information:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Expression\nConsider an expression of the form \(f(x) = (px + q)^n\), where $p$ and $q$ are constants, and $n$ is a real number.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Power Rule\nThe power rule for integration states that for any real number $n \neq -1$:\n\n$$\n\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Apply Substitution\nFor expressions like \(f(x) = (px + q)^n\), it is often useful to use substitution. Let:\n\n$$\nu = px + q \implies du = p \, dx \implies dx = \frac{du}{p}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Rewrite the Integral\nSubstituting $u$ into the integral gives:\n\n$$\n\int (px + q)^n \, dx = \int u^n \cdot \frac{du}{p} = \frac{1}{p} \int u^n \, du\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Integrate Using the Power Rule\nNow, apply the power rule to integrate $u^n$:\n\n$$\n\int u^n \, du = \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$\n\int (px + q)^n \, dx = \frac{1}{p} \left( \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \right) = \frac{(px + q)^{n+1}}{p(n+1)} + C\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Final Result\nThe final result for the integral of the bracketed expression is:\n\n$$\n\int (px + q)^n \, dx = \frac{(px + q)^{n+1}}{p(n+1)} + C\n$$\n\n### Example\nFor example, if you want to integrate \(f(x) = (3x + 2)^4\):\n\n1. Set $u = 3x + 2$, then $du = 3 \, dx$ or $dx = \frac{du}{3}$.\n2. Rewrite the integral:\n\n$$\n\int (3x + 2)^4 \, dx = \int u^4 \cdot \frac{du}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \int u^4 \, du\n$$\n\n3. Apply the power rule:\n\n$$\n\frac{1}{3} \cdot \left( \frac{u^5}{5} + C \right) = \frac{1}{15} u^5 + C = \frac{1}{15} (3x + 2)^5 + C\n$$\n\nThis method can be applied to any bracketed expression with a coefficient of $x$ by following the steps outlined above.
