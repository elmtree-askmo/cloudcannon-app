    How do you verify the solutions of a quadratic equation?
answer: >-
    To verify the solutions of a quadratic equation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Quadratic Equation**: A quadratic equation is typically in the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $, where $ a \neq 0 $.\n\n2. **Find the Roots**: Use one of the methods to find the roots of the equation:\n   - **Factoring**: If the quadratic can be factored, express it as \( (px + q)(rx + s) = 0 \) and solve for $ x $.\n   - **Quadratic Formula**: Use the formula $ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $ to find the roots.\n   - **Completing the Square**: Rearrange the equation to complete the square and solve for $ x $.\n\n3. **Substitute Back**: Once you have the potential solutions (roots), substitute them back into the original quadratic equation to check if they satisfy the equation. For example, if you found a root $ x_1 $, substitute it into the equation:\n   $$ ax_1^2 + bx_1 + c = 0 $$\n   If the left-hand side equals zero, then $ x_1 $ is a valid solution.\n\n4. **Check the Discriminant**: The discriminant $ D = b^2 - 4ac $ can also provide insight into the nature of the solutions:\n   - If $ D > 0 $, there are two distinct real solutions.\n   - If $ D = 0 $, there is exactly one real solution (a repeated root).\n   - If $ D < 0 $, there are no real solutions.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification**: You can also graph the quadratic function $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ and observe where it intersects the x-axis. The x-coordinates of these intersection points are the solutions to the equation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively verify the solutions of a quadratic equation.
