    What techniques are used for variable manipulation in solving equations?
answer: >-
    Variable manipulation in solving equations involves several techniques that help isolate variables and simplify expressions. Here are some key methods:\n\n1. **Substitution Method**: This technique is particularly useful for solving systems of equations. The process involves:\n   - Solving one equation for one variable (e.g., $y = mx + b$).\n   - Substituting this expression into the other equation to reduce the number of variables.\n   - Solving the resulting single-variable equation.\n   - Substituting back to find the other variable.\n\n   For example, given the equations:\n   $$\n   x + y = 10 \quad (1)\n   $$\n   $$\n   2x - y = 3 \quad (2)\n   $$\n   You can solve equation (1) for $y$:\n   $$\n   y = 10 - x\n   $$\n   Then substitute into equation (2):\n   $$\n   2x - (10 - x) = 3 \implies 3x - 10 = 3 \implies 3x = 13 \implies x = \frac{13}{3}\n   $$\n   Substitute $x$ back into equation (1) to find $y$.\n\n2. **Elimination Method**: This method involves manipulating the equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve for the other. Steps include:\n   - Aligning the equations so that corresponding variables are lined up.\n   - Adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.\n   - Solving the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\n\n   For instance, using the same system:\n   $$\n   x - y = 1 \quad (1)\n   $$\n   $$\n   x + y = 5 \quad (2)\n   $$\n   Adding both equations:\n   $$\n   (x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 5 \implies 2x = 6 \implies x = 3\n   $$\n   Substitute $x$ back into one of the original equations to find $y$.\n\n3. **Factoring**: In some cases, you can manipulate equations by factoring them. This is particularly useful for quadratic equations. For example, if you have:\n   $$\n   x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n   $$\n   You can factor it as:\n   $$\n   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n   $$\n   This gives the solutions $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms**: When simplifying algebraic expressions, combining like terms can help isolate variables. For example:\n   $$\n   3x + 4x - 2 = 10 \implies 7x - 2 = 10\n   $$\n   Adding 2 to both sides gives:\n   $$\n   7x = 12 \implies x = \frac{12}{7}\n   $$\n\n5. **Using Inverse Operations**: To isolate a variable, you can apply inverse operations. For example, if you have:\n   $$\n   2x + 3 = 11\n   $$\n   You can subtract 3 from both sides and then divide by 2:\n   $$\n   2x = 8 \implies x = 4\n   $$\n\nThese techniques are fundamental in algebra and are essential for solving equations effectively. Each method can be chosen based on the specific structure of the equations involved.
