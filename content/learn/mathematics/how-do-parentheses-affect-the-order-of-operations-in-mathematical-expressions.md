    How do parentheses affect the order of operations in mathematical expressions?
answer: >-
    Parentheses play a critical role in determining the order of operations in mathematical expressions. They indicate that the operations enclosed within them should be performed first, which helps to clarify complex calculations and avoid ambiguity.\n\nFor example, consider the expression:\n\n$$\n3 \times (2 + 5)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the addition inside the parentheses is performed first:\n\n$$\n2 + 5 = 7\n$$\n\nThen, the multiplication is carried out:\n\n$$\n3 \times 7 = 21\n$$\n\nWithout parentheses, the order of operations would follow the standard rules (often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS), which prioritize multiplication over addition. Thus, if we had the expression:\n\n$$\n3 \times 2 + 5\n$$\n\nIt would be evaluated as:\n\n$$\n(3 \times 2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11\n$$\n\nThis illustrates how parentheses can significantly alter the outcome of an expression.\n\n### Summary of Effects\n- **With Parentheses**: The operations within parentheses are executed first, which can change the result of the entire expression.\n- **Without Parentheses**: The standard order of operations applies, which may lead to different results.\n\n### Importance in Mathematical Contexts\nUnderstanding the use of parentheses is crucial in various mathematical contexts, such as the Pythagorean theorem, where negative results are not meaningful. For instance, when squaring a negative number, parentheses ensure that the entire number is squared:\n\n$$\n(-3)^2 = 9\n$$\n\nWithout parentheses, the expression would be interpreted differently:\n\n$$\n-3^2 = -9\n$$\n\n### Common Mistakes\nA frequent mistake is neglecting to use parentheses, which can lead to incorrect interpretations and results, especially when using calculators that may not follow the intended order of operations. \n\n### Practical Tips\n- Always use parentheses to clarify operations in mathematical expressions.\n- Double-check calculations involving negative numbers to ensure accuracy.\n- Be aware of the context in which you are working to determine if negative results are appropriate.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure accuracy in your mathematical calculations.
