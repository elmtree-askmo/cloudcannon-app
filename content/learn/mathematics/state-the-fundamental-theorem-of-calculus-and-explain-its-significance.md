    State the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and explain its significance.
answer: >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a pivotal result in calculus that establishes a profound connection between differentiation and integration. It can be stated as follows:\n\nIf $ F $ is an antiderivative of a continuous function $ f $ on the interval $[a, b]$, then:\n\n$$\n\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n$$\n\n### Significance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\n1. **Connection Between Differentiation and Integration**: The theorem shows that integration can be reversed by differentiation. This means that if you know the antiderivative of a function, you can easily compute the definite integral of that function over an interval.\n\n2. **Practical Computation of Areas**: The theorem provides a method to calculate the area under a curve (represented by the definite integral) using antiderivatives, which are often easier to work with than evaluating limits of Riemann sums.\n\n3. **Foundation for Further Studies**: It serves as a foundation for more advanced topics in calculus and analysis, including improper integrals, differential equations, and multivariable calculus.\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation**: Geometrically, the definite integral represents the area between the curve \( f(x) \) and the x-axis from $ x = a $ to $ x = b $. If \( f(x) \) is positive, the integral gives the area above the x-axis; if negative, it gives the area below the x-axis.\n\n5. **Applications in Real-World Problems**: The theorem is widely used in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields to solve problems involving rates of change and accumulation.\n\nIn summary, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus not only bridges the gap between two fundamental operations in calculus but also provides a powerful tool for solving practical problems involving areas and rates of change.
