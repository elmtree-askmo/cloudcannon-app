    How is the transformation of a cos x + b sin x into the form R cos (x − α) performed?
answer: >-
    To transform the expression $a \cos x + b \sin x$ into the form \(R \cos(x - \alpha)\), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Constants**: Start with the expression $a \cos x + b \sin x$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\n2. **Calculate $R$**: Use the formula for $R$:\n   $$\n   R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   $$\n   This represents the amplitude of the resultant cosine function.\n\n3. **Determine $\alpha$**: Calculate the angle $\alpha$ using the tangent function:\n   $$\n   \tan \alpha = \frac{b}{a}\n   $$\n   This angle $\alpha$ will help in adjusting the phase of the cosine function.\n\n4. **Rewrite the Expression**: Finally, you can express $a \cos x + b \sin x$ in the desired form:\n   $$\n   a \cos x + b \sin x = R \cos(x - \alpha)\n   $$\n\nThis transformation is particularly useful in simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving equations, as it allows you to work with a single trigonometric function instead of a sum of two. \n\nFor example, if you have $3 \cos x + 4 \sin x$:\n- Calculate $R$:\n  $$\n  R = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\n  $$\n- Calculate $\alpha$:\n  $$\n  \tan \alpha = \frac{4}{3} \implies \alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)\n  $$\n- Rewrite the expression:\n  $$\n  3 \cos x + 4 \sin x = 5 \cos\left(x - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)\right)\n  $$\n\nThis method is a powerful tool in trigonometry, allowing for easier manipulation and understanding of trigonometric functions.
