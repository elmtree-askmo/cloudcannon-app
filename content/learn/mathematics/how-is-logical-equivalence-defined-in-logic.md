    How is logical equivalence defined in logic?
answer: >-
    In logic, logical equivalence is defined as the relationship between two statements or propositions that have the same truth value in every possible model or interpretation. This means that if one statement is true, the other must also be true, and if one is false, the other must also be false. \n\nFormally, two compound sentences $X$ and $Y$ are said to be logically equivalent if their truth tables yield the same truth values for all combinations of truth values of their constituent variables. This can be symbolically represented as $X \equiv Y$ or $X \Leftrightarrow Y$, indicating that $X$ is true if and only if $Y$ is true.\n\nLogical equivalence is crucial in various areas of logic and mathematics, as it allows for the manipulation of logical expressions without changing their fundamental meaning. For example, an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nP \rightarrow Q \equiv \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P\n$$\n\nIn addition, logical equivalence is distinct from material equivalence, which refers to the truth of statements based on their actual content rather than their logical structure. The concept of logical equivalence is foundational in critical thinking and logical analysis, as it helps in assessing the validity of arguments and the relationships between different propositions. \n\nTo verify logical equivalence, one can use truth tables or other logical reasoning techniques, such as testing the biconditional $X \Leftrightarrow Y$ for logical truth. If the biconditional holds true in all scenarios, then $X$ and $Y$ are logically equivalent.
