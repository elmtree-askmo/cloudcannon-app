    What is the formula for calculating the scalar product of two vectors?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the scalar product (or dot product) of two vectors is given by:\n\nIf \(\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)\) and \(\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)\), then the scalar product is calculated as:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3.\n$$\n\nAlternatively, the scalar product can also be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between them:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos(\theta),\n$$\n\nwhere $|\mathbf{a}|$ and $|\mathbf{b}|$ are the magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, respectively.\n\nThis operation is useful in various applications, such as determining the angle between two vectors or projecting one vector onto another. Additionally, it has important properties, such as:\n\n- Two vectors are perpendicular if their scalar product is zero, i.e., $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$.\n- The scalar product is distributive over addition, meaning \(\mathbf{p} \cdot (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}\).\n\nThese properties make the scalar product a fundamental operation in vector mathematics.
