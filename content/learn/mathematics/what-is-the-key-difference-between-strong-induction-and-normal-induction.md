    What is the key difference between strong induction and normal induction?
answer: >-
    The key difference between strong induction and normal (or weak) induction lies in the nature of the inductive hypothesis used in the proofs.\n\n1. **Inductive Hypothesis**:\n   - In **normal induction**, the inductive hypothesis assumes that the statement \(P(k)\) is true for a specific integer $k$. This assumption is then used to prove that \(P(k+1)\) is also true.\n   - In **strong induction**, the inductive hypothesis is broader. It assumes that the statement \(P(i)\) is true for all integers $i$ from the base case up to $k$ (i.e., \(P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)\)). This allows the proof of \(P(k+1)\) to utilize all previous cases, not just the immediate predecessor \(P(k)\).\n\n2. **Use Cases**:\n   - Normal induction is typically effective when the problem can be reduced by exactly one step (e.g., proving properties of sequences or sums).\n   - Strong induction is particularly useful when the proof for \(P(k+1)\) may depend on multiple previous cases, not just \(P(k)\). This is often the case in combinatorial problems or when the structure of the problem allows for multiple smaller cases to contribute to the next step.\n\n3. **Equivalence**:\n   - Despite these differences, strong induction and normal induction are equivalent in terms of their ability to prove statements. Any proof that can be conducted using strong induction can also be reformulated to use normal induction, and vice versa. This equivalence is important to note, as it highlights that neither method is inherently stronger than the other; they simply provide different approaches based on the problem's requirements.\n\nIn summary, the main distinction is that strong induction allows for a more comprehensive inductive hypothesis, which can be advantageous in certain proofs where multiple previous cases are relevant.
