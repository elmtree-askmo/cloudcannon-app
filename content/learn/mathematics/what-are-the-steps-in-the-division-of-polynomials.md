    Dividing polynomials can be accomplished using two primary methods: long division and synthetic division. Below are the detailed steps for each method.\n\n### Long Division of Polynomials\n\n1. **Arrange the Polynomials**: Write the dividend (the polynomial being divided) and the divisor (the polynomial you are dividing by) in standard form, ensuring that all terms are present (including those with a coefficient of zero).\n\n2. **Divide the Leading Terms**: Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This result will be the first term of the quotient.\n\n3. **Multiply and Subtract**: Multiply the entire divisor by the term obtained in step 2 and subtract this product from the dividend. This will give you a new polynomial.\n\n4. **Bring Down the Next Term**: If there are any remaining terms in the dividend, bring down the next term to the new polynomial obtained from the subtraction.\n\n5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 to 4 with the new polynomial until the degree of the new polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor.\n\n6. **Write the Result**: The result of the division will be the quotient obtained from the repeated steps, and any remaining polynomial will be the remainder.\n\n### Example of Long Division\n\nTo illustrate, letâ€™s divide $ 2x^2 + 4x $ by $ 2x $:\n\n1. Divide $ 2x^2 $ by $ 2x $ to get $ x $.\n2. Multiply $ 2x $ by $ x $ to get $ 2x^2 $ and subtract from $ 2x^2 + 4x $ to get $ 4x - 2x^2 = 4x - 2x^2 $.\n3. Since there are no more terms to bring down, the process stops here, and the result is $ x + 2 $.\n\n### Synthetic Division\n\nSynthetic division is a simplified method used primarily when dividing by a linear binomial of the form $ x - c $.\n\n1. **Set Up the Synthetic Division**: Write down the coefficients of the dividend polynomial. If any terms are missing, use a coefficient of zero for those terms.\n\n2. **Write the Value of c**: Write the value of $ c $ (from $ x - c $) to the left.\n\n3. **Bring Down the Leading Coefficient**: Bring down the leading coefficient of the dividend.\n\n4. **Multiply and Add**: Multiply the value of $ c $ by the number you just brought down, and write the result under the next coefficient. Add this result to the next coefficient.\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue this process until all coefficients have been used.\n\n6. **Write the Result**: The final row will represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, and the last number will be the remainder.\n\n### Example of Synthetic Division\n\nFor example, to divide $ 2x^2 + 4x $ by $ x - 2 $:\n\n1. Coefficients: $ [2, 4] $ (no constant term, so we can treat it as $ [2, 4, 0] $).\n2. Set $ c = 2 $.\n3. Bring down $ 2 $.\n4. Multiply $ 2 $ by $ 2 $ (the value of $ c $) to get $ 4 $, and add to $ 4 $ to get $ 8 $.\n5. Multiply $ 2 $ by $ 0 $ to get $ 0 $, and add to $ 0 $ to get $ 0 $.\n\nThe result is $ 2x + 8 $ with a remainder of $ 0 $.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth long division and synthetic division are effective methods for dividing polynomials, with long division being more general and synthetic division being quicker for specific cases. Understanding both methods allows for flexibility in solving polynomial division problems.
