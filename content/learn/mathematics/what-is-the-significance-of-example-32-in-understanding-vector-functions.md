    What is the significance of Example 3.2 in understanding vector functions?
answer: >-
    Example 3.2 plays a significant role in understanding vector functions, particularly in the context of calculus of vector-valued functions. This example typically illustrates the process of finding the derivative of a vector-valued function, which is crucial for determining the tangent vector at a given point on a curve traced by the vector function.\n\nThe key learning objectives associated with this example include:\n\n1. **Writing the Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function**: Understanding how to express the derivative of a vector function is foundational. The derivative, denoted as $\vec{r}'(t)$, provides insight into the rate of change of the position vector with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\n2. **Finding the Tangent Vector**: The tangent vector at a point on the curve is derived from the derivative of the position vector. This vector indicates the direction in which the curve is heading at that specific point.\n\n3. **Unit Tangent Vector**: The unit tangent vector, which is obtained by normalizing the tangent vector, is particularly significant. It provides a direction without regard to magnitude, allowing for a clearer understanding of the curve's orientation. The existence of this unit tangent vector ensures that the curve is smooth and differentiable, meaning it has no "corners" or abrupt changes in direction.\n\n4. **Calculating Definite Integrals**: Example 3.2 may also involve calculating the definite integral of a vector-valued function, which is essential for understanding the total displacement along the curve over a specified interval.\n\nOverall, Example 3.2 encapsulates the fundamental concepts of derivatives, tangent vectors, and the smoothness of curves in vector calculus, making it a critical reference point for students and practitioners working with vector functions in both theoretical and applied contexts.
