    What is the step-by-step process for solving equations?
answer: >-
    To solve equations step-by-step, you can follow a systematic approach that helps isolate the variable and find its value. Hereâ€™s a general process applicable to various types of equations, particularly linear equations:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: Determine whether the equation is linear, quadratic, or another type. This will guide your approach.\n\n2. **Simplify Each Side**: \n   - Remove any parentheses by using the distributive property. For example, in the equation \(3(x + 4) = 2x + 10\), distribute the 3 to get $3x + 12 = 2x + 10$.\n   - Combine like terms on each side if necessary.\n\n3. **Isolate the Variable**: \n   - Use inverse operations to move terms involving the variable to one side of the equation and constant terms to the other side. \n   - For example, if you have $3x + 12 = 2x + 10$, subtract $2x$ from both sides to get $x + 12 = 10$.\n\n4. **Perform Operations to Solve for the Variable**: \n   - If there are constants on the side with the variable, subtract or add them to isolate the variable. Continuing from the previous example, subtract 12 from both sides: $x = 10 - 12$, which simplifies to $x = -2$.\n\n5. **Check Your Solution**: Substitute the value of the variable back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal. This step verifies that your solution is correct.\n\n6. **Consider Special Cases**: If you are dealing with equations involving multiple variables, you may need to use methods such as substitution or elimination to solve for one variable in terms of the others.\n\n7. **Solve Multi-Step Equations**: For more complex equations, repeat the above steps as necessary, ensuring to simplify and isolate the variable at each stage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve various equations, enhancing your problem-solving skills in algebra.
