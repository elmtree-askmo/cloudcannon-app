    How do you calculate the absolute value of both positive and negative numbers?
answer: >-
    To calculate the absolute value of both positive and negative numbers, you can follow these simple rules:\n\n1. **Definition**: The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always a non-negative value.\n\n2. **Notation**: The absolute value of a number $ x $ is denoted by $ |x| $. \n\n3. **Calculation**:\n   - For a **positive number**: The absolute value is the number itself. For example, if $ N = 12 $, then $ |N| = |12| = 12 $.\n   - For a **negative number**: The absolute value is the positive counterpart of that number. For example, if $ N = -6 $, then $ |N| = |-6| = 6 $.\n\n4. **General Rule**:\n   - If $ N \geq 0 $, then $ |N| = N $.\n   - If $ N < 0 $, then $ |N| = -N $.\n\n### Examples:\n- For $ N = -6 $:\n  $$ |N| = |-6| = 6 $$\n- For $ N = 12 $:\n  $$ |N| = |12| = 12 $$\n\n### Summary:\nThe absolute value function can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n|x| = \n\begin{cases} \nx & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ \n-x & \text{if } x < 0 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis means that the absolute value function effectively transforms any negative input into a positive output, while positive inputs remain unchanged.
