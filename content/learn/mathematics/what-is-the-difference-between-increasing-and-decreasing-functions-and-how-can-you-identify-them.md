answer: >-
    The difference between increasing and decreasing functions lies in how their output values change as the input values increase. \n\n### Definitions:\n1. **Increasing Function**: A function \( f(x) \) is said to be increasing on an interval $ I $ if for any two numbers $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ in $ I $ such that $ x_1 < x_2 $, it holds that \( f(x_1) \leq f(x_2) \). This means that as you move from left to right along the x-axis, the y-values of the function either rise or remain constant.\n\n2. **Decreasing Function**: Conversely, a function \( f(x) \) is decreasing on an interval if for any two numbers $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ in that interval, where $ x_1 < x_2 $, it holds that \( f(x_1) \geq f(x_2) \). This indicates that as you move right, the y-values of the function fall or remain constant.\n\n### Identifying Increasing and Decreasing Functions:\nTo identify whether a function is increasing or decreasing, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. **Graphical Analysis**:\n   - **Increasing**: If the graph of \( f(x) \) rises as you move from left to right, the function is increasing.\n   - **Decreasing**: If the graph falls as you move from left to right, the function is decreasing.\n   - **Constant**: If the graph remains flat, the function is constant over that interval.\n\n2. **Using Derivatives**:\n   - Calculate the derivative \( f'(x) \) of the function.\n   - **Increasing**: The function is increasing on intervals where \( f'(x) > 0 \).\n   - **Decreasing**: The function is decreasing on intervals where \( f'(x) < 0 \).\n   - **Constant**: If \( f'(x) = 0 \) for all $ x $ in an interval, the function is constant on that interval.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a function \( f(x) \):\n- If \( f(x) = x^2 \), the derivative \( f'(x) = 2x \). The function is increasing for $ x > 0 $ and decreasing for $ x < 0 $.\n- If \( f(x) = -x^2 \), the derivative \( f'(x) = -2x \). The function is decreasing for $ x > 0 $ and increasing for $ x < 0 $.\n\n### Summary:\nUnderstanding whether a function is increasing or decreasing is crucial for analyzing its behavior, finding maximum and minimum values, and solving various calculus problems. By using graphical analysis and differentiation, you can effectively identify the intervals of increase and decrease for any given function.
