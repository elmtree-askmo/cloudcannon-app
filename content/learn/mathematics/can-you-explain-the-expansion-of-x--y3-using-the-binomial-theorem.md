answer: >-
    The expansion of \((x + y)^3\) using the Binomial Theorem can be derived as follows:\n\nThe Binomial Theorem states that for any positive integer $n$, the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by:\n\n$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$\n\nwhere $\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n\n$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n\nFor the case of \((x + y)^3\), we set $a = x$, $b = y$, and $n = 3$. Thus, we can write:\n\n$$(x + y)^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{3} \binom{3}{k} x^{3-k} y^k$$\n\nNow, we can calculate each term in the expansion:\n\n1. For $k = 0$:\n   $$\binom{3}{0} x^{3-0} y^0 = 1 \cdot x^3 \cdot 1 = x^3$$\n\n2. For $k = 1$:\n   $$\binom{3}{1} x^{3-1} y^1 = 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot y = 3x^2y$$\n\n3. For $k = 2$:\n   $$\binom{3}{2} x^{3-2} y^2 = 3 \cdot x^1 \cdot y^2 = 3xy^2$$\n\n4. For $k = 3$:\n   $$\binom{3}{3} x^{3-3} y^3 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot y^3 = y^3$$\n\nPutting all these terms together, we get the full expansion:\n\n$$(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$$\n\nThis expansion illustrates how the Binomial Theorem can be used to systematically derive the terms of a binomial expression raised to a power. Each term consists of a binomial coefficient multiplied by the respective powers of $x$ and $y$.
