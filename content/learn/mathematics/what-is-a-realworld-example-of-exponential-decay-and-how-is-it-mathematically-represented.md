    What is a real-world example of exponential decay, and how is it mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    A real-world example of exponential decay is radioactive decay, which describes the process by which unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. This decay occurs at a rate that is proportional to the amount of the substance present, leading to a decrease in the quantity of the radioactive material over time.\n\nMathematically, radioactive decay can be represented by the exponential decay function:\n\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( N(t) \) is the quantity of the substance remaining at time $ t $,\n- $ N_0 $ is the initial quantity of the substance,\n- $ \lambda $ is the decay constant (a positive real number that represents the probability of decay per unit time),\n- $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828).\n\nIn this model, as time $ t $ increases, the term $ e^{-\lambda t} $ decreases, leading to a reduction in the quantity \( N(t) \). This illustrates the characteristic rapid decrease associated with exponential decay.\n\nAnother common example of exponential decay is the depreciation of the value of an asset over time, such as a car or electronic device, which can also be modeled using similar exponential decay functions.
