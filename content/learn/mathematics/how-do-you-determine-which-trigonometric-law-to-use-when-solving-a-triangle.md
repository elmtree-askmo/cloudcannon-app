    How do you determine which trigonometric law to use when solving a triangle?
answer: >-
    When solving a triangle, the choice between using the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines depends on the information you have about the triangle. Here are the guidelines for determining which law to use:\n\n1. **Law of Sines**: This law is particularly useful when you have:\n   - Two angles and one side (AAS or ASA configuration).\n   - Two sides and a non-included angle (SSA configuration).\n   \n   The Law of Sines states that the ratios of the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the sines of their opposite angles are equal:\n   $$\n   \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\n   $$\n   where $ a, b, c $ are the lengths of the sides opposite angles $ A, B, C $ respectively.\n\n2. **Law of Cosines**: This law is more appropriate when you have:\n   - Two sides and the included angle (SAS configuration).\n   - All three sides (SSS configuration).\n\n   The Law of Cosines is given by:\n   $$\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)\n   $$\n   where $ c $ is the side opposite angle $ C $, and $ a $ and $ b $ are the other two sides.\n\n### Summary of When to Use Each Law:\n- **Use the Law of Sines** when you know:\n  - AAS or ASA (two angles and one side).\n  - SSA (two sides and a non-included angle).\n\n- **Use the Law of Cosines** when you know:\n  - SAS (two sides and the included angle).\n  - SSS (all three sides).\n\nBy assessing the given information about the triangle, you can determine which law is most suitable for solving for the unknown angles or sides.
