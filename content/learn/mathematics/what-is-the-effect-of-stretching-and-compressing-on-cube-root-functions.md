    What is the effect of stretching and compressing on cube root functions?
answer: >-
    The effect of stretching and compressing on cube root functions can be understood through transformations of the parent function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) or \( f(x) = x^{1/3} \). These transformations can be categorized into vertical and horizontal stretches or compressions, which are influenced by constant factors applied to the function.\n\n### Vertical Stretch and Compression\nWhen a cube root function is multiplied by a constant $ a $, the transformation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\ng(x) = a \cdot f(x) = a \cdot \sqrt[3]{x}\n$$\n\n- **Vertical Stretch**: If $ a > 1 $, the graph of the function is vertically stretched. This means that every point on the graph moves away from the horizontal axis (x-axis) by a factor of $ a $. For example, if $ a = 2 $, the function \( g(x) = 2 \cdot \sqrt[3]{x} \) will stretch the graph vertically, doubling the distance of each point from the x-axis.\n\n- **Vertical Compression**: If $ 0 < a < 1 $, the graph is vertically compressed. This results in every point moving closer to the x-axis. For instance, if $ a = 0.5 $, the function \( g(x) = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt[3]{x} \) compresses the graph vertically, halving the distance of each point from the x-axis.\n\n### Horizontal Stretch and Compression\nWhen the input $ x $ is multiplied by a constant $ b $, the transformation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\ng(x) = f(bx) = \sqrt[3]{bx}\n$$\n\n- **Horizontal Stretch**: If $ 0 < b < 1 $, the graph undergoes a horizontal stretch. This means that the graph will spread out, making it wider. For example, if $ b = 0.5 $, the function \( g(x) = \sqrt[3]{0.5x} \) will stretch the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\n- **Horizontal Compression**: If $ b > 1 $, the graph is horizontally compressed. This results in the graph becoming narrower. For instance, if $ b = 2 $, the function \( g(x) = \sqrt[3]{2x} \) compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of $ \frac{1}{2} $.\n\n### Summary of Effects\n- **Vertical Stretch**: $ a > 1 $ → Graph moves away from x-axis.\n- **Vertical Compression**: $ 0 < a < 1 $ → Graph moves closer to x-axis.\n- **Horizontal Stretch**: $ 0 < b < 1 $ → Graph spreads out.\n- **Horizontal Compression**: $ b > 1 $ → Graph becomes narrower.\n\nThese transformations allow for a variety of shapes and behaviors in the graph of cube root functions, making them versatile in mathematical modeling and analysis. Understanding these effects is crucial for graphing and interpreting cube root functions effectively.
