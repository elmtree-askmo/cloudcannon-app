    To determine the maximum and minimum values of a function using derivatives, you can follow a systematic approach that involves the first and second derivative tests. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n### Step 1: Find Critical Points\n1. **Differentiate the Function**: Start by finding the first derivative of the function, denoted as \( f'(x) \). This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the function at any point $ x $.\n2. **Set the Derivative to Zero**: Solve the equation \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find critical points. These points are where the slope of the tangent line is horizontal, indicating potential local maxima or minima.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Critical Points\nOnce you have identified the critical points, you can classify them using the second derivative test:\n1. **Find the Second Derivative**: Compute the second derivative of the function, denoted as \( f''(x) \).\n2. **Evaluate the Second Derivative at Critical Points**:\n   - If \( f''(x) > 0 \) at a critical point, the function is concave up, and that point is a local minimum.\n   - If \( f''(x) < 0 \) at a critical point, the function is concave down, and that point is a local maximum.\n   - If \( f''(x) = 0 \), the test is inconclusive, and further analysis may be needed.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Endpoints (if applicable)\nIf you are working with a function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, you should also evaluate the function at the endpoints:\n- Calculate \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \).\n- Compare these values with the local maxima and minima found in the previous steps to determine the absolute maximum and minimum values on the interval.\n\n### Example\nConsider the function \( f(x) = -x^2 + 4x \):\n1. **First Derivative**: \n   $$ f'(x) = -2x + 4 $$\n   Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):\n   $$ -2x + 4 = 0 \implies x = 2 $$\n   \n2. **Second Derivative**:\n   $$ f''(x) = -2 $$\n   Since \( f''(2) = -2 < 0 \), $ x = 2 $ is a local maximum.\n\n3. **Evaluate at Endpoints** (if defined on an interval, e.g., [0, 4]):\n   - \( f(0) = 0 \)\n   - \( f(4) = 0 \)\n   - \( f(2) = 4 \)\n\nIn this case, the maximum value is $ 4 $ at $ x = 2 $, and the minimum value is $ 0 $ at both endpoints $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 4 $.\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing derivatives to find maximum and minimum values is a powerful technique in calculus, applicable in various fields such as economics, engineering, and physics. By following the steps outlined above, you can systematically identify and classify critical points to determine the extrema of a function.
