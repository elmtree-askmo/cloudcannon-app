    What is an inverse function and how can you find it for a given function?
answer: >-
    An inverse function is a function that reverses the effect of the original function. If you have a function \( f(x) \), its inverse is denoted as \( f^{-1}(x) \). The defining property of inverse functions is that applying the original function followed by its inverse returns the original input, which can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nf(f^{-1}(x)) = x\n$$\n\nfor all $ x $ in the domain of $ f^{-1} $.\n\n### How to Find the Inverse of a Function\n\nTo find the inverse of a given function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Replace \( f(x) \) with $ y $**: Start by rewriting the function in terms of $ y $.\n   - For example, if \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \), write it as $ y = 2x + 3 $.\n\n2. **Swap $ x $ and $ y $**: Interchange the roles of $ x $ and $ y $.\n   - From $ y = 2x + 3 $, you get $ x = 2y + 3 $.\n\n3. **Solve for $ y $**: Rearrange the equation to solve for $ y $.\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: $ x - 3 = 2y $.\n   - Divide by 2: $ y = \frac{x - 3}{2} $.\n\n4. **Replace $ y $ with \( f^{-1}(x) \)**: Finally, denote the result as the inverse function.\n   - Thus, \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2} \).\n\n### Example\n\nFor the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \):\n- The inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2} \).\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Domain and Range**: The domain of the original function becomes the range of the inverse function, and vice versa.\n- **One-to-One Functions**: Not all functions have inverses. A function must be one-to-one (bijective) to have an inverse, meaning it passes the horizontal line test (no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once).\n\nInverse functions are particularly useful in solving equations and understanding relationships between variables, as they allow you to express one variable in terms of another.
