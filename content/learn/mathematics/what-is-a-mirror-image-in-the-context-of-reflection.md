    What is a mirror image in the context of reflection?
answer: >-
    In the context of reflection, a mirror image refers to the visual representation of an object as it appears when viewed in a mirror. This phenomenon occurs due to the geometric transformation known as reflection, where an object is flipped across a specific line, called the line of reflection. \n\n### Key Characteristics of a Mirror Image:\n\n1. **Virtual Image**: The image created by a plane mirror is a virtual image, meaning it cannot be projected onto a screen. It appears to be located behind the mirror at the same distance as the object is in front of it.\n\n2. **Lateral Inversion**: One of the most notable features of a mirror image is lateral inversion, which is the apparent left-to-right reversal of the object. For example, if you raise your right hand, the mirror image will show your left hand raised.\n\n3. **Upright and Congruent**: The mirror image is upright and maintains the same size and shape as the original object. This means that if an object is 2 feet tall, its mirror image will also appear to be 2 feet tall.\n\n4. **Line of Reflection**: The line of reflection acts as the "mirror." Common lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$. The position of the object relative to this line determines the position of its mirror image.\n\n5. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, which means that the distances between points are preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a simple example where a point \(A(2, 3)\) is reflected across the y-axis. The mirror image of point $A$ would be \(A'(-2, 3)\). Here, the y-coordinate remains the same, while the x-coordinate changes sign, demonstrating the concept of lateral inversion.\n\nIn summary, a mirror image in the context of reflection is a geometric transformation that results in a flipped version of an object across a specified line, preserving its size and shape while creating an appearance of reversal.
