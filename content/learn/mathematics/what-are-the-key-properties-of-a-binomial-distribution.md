    What are the key properties of a binomial distribution?
answer: >-
    The binomial distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory, characterized by several key properties:\n\n1. **Fixed Number of Trials (n)**: The binomial distribution is defined for a fixed number of trials, denoted as \( n \). This means that the total number of attempts to observe a specific outcome (success or failure) is predetermined and remains constant throughout the experiment.\n\n2. **Two Possible Outcomes**: Each trial in a binomial experiment results in one of two outcomes: success or failure. The probability of success is denoted as \( p \), while the probability of failure is \( q = 1 - p \).\n\n3. **Independent Trials**: The trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcomes of other trials. This independence is crucial for the validity of the binomial distribution.\n\n4. **Probability Mass Function**: The probability of obtaining exactly \( k \) successes in \( n \) trials is given by the probability mass function:\n   $$\n   P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}\n   $$\n   where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes from \( n \) trials.\n\n5. **Mean and Variance**: The mean (expected value) and variance of a binomial distribution are calculated using the following formulas:\n   - Mean: \( \mu = np \)\n   - Variance: \( \sigma^2 = npq \)\n   - Standard Deviation: \( \sigma = \sqrt{npq} \)\n\n6. **Discrete Distribution**: The binomial distribution is discrete, meaning it deals with countable outcomes (e.g., the number of successes in a series of trials), as opposed to continuous distributions like the normal distribution.\n\n7. **Special Case - Bernoulli Distribution**: The binomial distribution can be viewed as a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution, which is a special case where the number of trials \( n = 1 \).\n\n8. **Mode and Median**: The mode of a binomial distribution can be calculated as \( \lfloor (n + 1)p \rfloor \), and while there is no single formula for the median, it can be determined based on the values of \( n \) and \( p \).\n\nThese properties make the binomial distribution a powerful tool for modeling scenarios where there are a fixed number of independent trials with two possible outcomes, such as flipping a coin or conducting a series of yes/no experiments.
