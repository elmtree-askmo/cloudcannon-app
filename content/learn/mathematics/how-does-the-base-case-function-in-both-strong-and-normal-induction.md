    How does the base case function in both strong and normal induction?
answer: >-
    In both strong induction and normal (or weak) induction, the base case serves as the foundational step that establishes the truth of the proposition for the smallest value in the domain of interest. Hereâ€™s how the base case functions in each method:\n\n### Normal Induction\n1. **Base Case**: In normal induction, you typically prove the base case for the smallest integer, often $ n = 1 $ or $ n = 0 $. This step verifies that the statement holds true for this initial value.\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: You assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary integer $ k $.\n3. **Inductive Step**: You then prove that if the statement is true for $ k $, it must also be true for $ k + 1 $. This step relies solely on the truth of the statement for the immediate predecessor.\n\nThe base case is crucial because it ensures that the induction process has a starting point. If the base case is not true, the entire induction argument fails.\n\n### Strong Induction\n1. **Base Case(s)**: In strong induction, you may have one or more base cases. For example, you might prove the base cases for several initial values (e.g., $ n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k_0 $). This is particularly useful when the inductive step requires knowledge of multiple preceding values.\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: You assume that the statement is true for all integers up to some arbitrary integer $ k $.\n3. **Inductive Step**: You then prove that the statement is true for $ k + 1 $ based on the assumption that it holds for all values less than or equal to $ k $. This allows for a broader range of assumptions compared to normal induction.\n\nThe base case(s) in strong induction ensure that the inductive step can utilize multiple previous cases, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the statement's validity for $ k + 1 $ depends on several earlier cases.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the base case in both forms of induction is essential for establishing the truth of the proposition at the starting point. In normal induction, it is typically a single case, while in strong induction, there may be multiple base cases to support the broader inductive hypothesis. Both methods rely on the base case to ensure that the inductive process can proceed correctly.
