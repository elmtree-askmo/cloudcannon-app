    To determine the domain and range of a square root function, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Domain of Square Root Functions\nThe domain of a square root function is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined. Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the input (x) must be non-negative. Therefore, the domain of a square root function can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Domain: } [0, \infty)\n$$\n\nThis means that the function is defined for all values of $ x $ that are greater than or equal to zero.\n\n### Range of Square Root Functions\nThe range of a square root function is the set of all possible output (y) values. Since the square root function produces non-negative outputs (the square root of any non-negative number is non-negative), the range can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } [0, \infty)\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the output values start from zero and extend to positive infinity.\n\n### Example\nFor the square root function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \):\n- **Domain:** \( [0, \infty) \)\n- **Range:** \( [0, \infty) \)\n\n### Graph Analysis\nWhen graphing a square root function, you will notice that it starts at the origin (0,0) and increases gradually as $ x $ increases. The graph resembles half of a parabola that opens to the right.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the domain of a square root function is limited to non-negative values, while the range also consists of non-negative values. This characteristic is crucial for understanding the behavior of square root functions in mathematical modeling and graphing.
