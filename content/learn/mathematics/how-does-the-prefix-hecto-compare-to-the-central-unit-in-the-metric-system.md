    How does the prefix 'hecto' compare to the central unit in the metric system?
answer: >-
    The prefix 'hecto-' in the metric system represents a factor of one hundred (10^2). It is positioned on the metric number line to the left of the base unit, which can be meters, liters, or grams. Specifically, 'hecto-' is used in measurements such as hectometers (hm) for distance and hectograms (hg) for mass. \n\nTo illustrate, 1 hectometer equals 100 meters, and 1 hectogram equals 100 grams. This means that when you are converting from hecto-units to the base unit, you would move the decimal point two places to the left. Conversely, if you are converting from the base unit to hecto-units, you would move the decimal point two places to the right.\n\nIn the context of the metric number line, the order of prefixes is as follows: kilo, hecto, deca, unit, deci, centi, milli. Therefore, 'hecto-' is one step away from the base unit, making it a larger unit compared to deci-, centi-, and milli-, but smaller than kilo-.\n\nIn summary, 'hecto-' is a significant metric prefix that facilitates the understanding and conversion of measurements in the metric system, particularly in fields like agriculture and land measurement where such units are commonly applied.
