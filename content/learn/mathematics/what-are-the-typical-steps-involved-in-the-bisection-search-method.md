answer: >-
    The Bisection Method is a reliable numerical technique used to find the roots of a continuous function. It operates under the premise that if a function changes sign over an interval, there exists at least one root within that interval, as guaranteed by the Intermediate Value Theorem. Here are the typical steps involved in the Bisection Method:\n\n1. **Initial Interval Selection**: Choose two initial guesses, $a$ and $b$, such that \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) have opposite signs (i.e., \(f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0\)). This indicates that a root exists between $a$ and $b$.\n\n2. **Calculate Midpoint**: Compute the midpoint $c$ of the interval:\n   $$\n   c = \frac{a + b}{2}\n   $$\n\n3. **Evaluate Function at Midpoint**: Evaluate the function at the midpoint, \(f(c)\).\n\n4. **Check for Root**: \n   - If \(f(c) = 0\), then $c$ is the root, and the process stops.\n   - If \(f(c) \neq 0\), determine which subinterval to keep:\n     - If \(f(a) \cdot f(c) < 0\), then the root lies in the interval $[a, c]$. Set $b = c$.\n     - If \(f(c) \cdot f(b) < 0\), then the root lies in the interval $[c, b]$. Set $a = c$.\n\n5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the desired level of accuracy is achieved, typically defined by a tolerance level $\epsilon$ such that \(|f(c)| < \epsilon\) or the interval width $|b - a| < \epsilon$.\n\n6. **Output the Result**: Once the stopping criteria are met, output the value of $c$ as the approximate root of the function.\n\nThis method is straightforward to implement and guarantees convergence, making it a popular choice for root-finding problems in numerical methods.
