    Explain the process of a 270 degrees clockwise rotation and its effect on coordinates.
answer: >-
    To perform a 270 degrees clockwise rotation of a point in the coordinate plane, we can use a specific transformation rule. The general rule for rotating a point \((x, y)\) 270 degrees clockwise around the origin is given by:\n\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-y, x)\n$$\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Original Coordinates**: Start with the original coordinates of the point you want to rotate. For example, letâ€™s say we have a point $P$ with coordinates \((x, y)\).\n\n2. **Apply the Transformation Rule**: To find the new coordinates after a 270 degrees clockwise rotation, apply the transformation:\n   - The new x-coordinate will be $-y$.\n   - The new y-coordinate will be $x$.\n\n   Therefore, the new coordinates \((x', y')\) after the rotation will be:\n   $$\n   (x', y') = (-y, x)\n   $$\n\n3. **Example Calculation**: \n   - If we take a point \(P(2, 3)\):\n     - The new x-coordinate will be $-3$ (since $y = 3$).\n     - The new y-coordinate will be $2$ (since $x = 2$).\n   - Thus, after a 270 degrees clockwise rotation, the new coordinates of point $P$ will be:\n   $$\n   P'(-3, 2)\n   $$\n\n### Effect on Coordinates:\n- The effect of a 270 degrees clockwise rotation is that the point moves to a new location that is effectively three quadrants away from its original position in the coordinate plane. This transformation can be visualized as a quarter-turn to the right around the origin.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, to rotate a point \((x, y)\) 270 degrees clockwise around the origin, you transform it to \((-y, x)\). This rule allows you to predict the new position of points and shapes accurately after rotation.
