    What are the basic mathematical operations supported in Scheme?
answer: >-
    Scheme, a dialect of the Lisp programming language, supports a variety of basic mathematical operations that are essential for performing arithmetic calculations. The primary mathematical operations available in Scheme include:\n\n1. **Addition**: The `+` operator is used to sum numbers. For example, `( + 1 2 3 )` evaluates to `6`.\n\n2. **Subtraction**: The `-` operator is used to subtract numbers. For instance, `( - 5 2 )` evaluates to `3`.\n\n3. **Multiplication**: The `*` operator is used for multiplying numbers. For example, `( * 2 3 4 )` evaluates to `24`.\n\n4. **Division**: The `/` operator is used to divide numbers. For instance, `( / 10 2 )` evaluates to `5`.\n\n5. **Exponentiation**: The `expt` function is used for raising a number to a power. For example, `( expt 2 3 )` evaluates to `8`, which is \(2^3\).\n\nIn addition to these basic operations, Scheme provides several other mathematical functions, including:\n\n- **Quotient**: The `quotient` function returns the integer quotient of two numbers. For example, `( quotient 10 3 )` evaluates to `3`.\n- **Remainder**: The `remainder` function returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, `( remainder 10 3 )` evaluates to `1`.\n- **Modulo**: The `modulo` function computes the modulus of two numbers. For example, `( modulo 10 3 )` evaluates to `1`.\n- **Square Root**: The `sqrt` function computes the square root of a number. For example, `( sqrt 16 )` evaluates to `4`.\n- **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `atan` are also available for performing trigonometric calculations.\n\nScheme's mathematical operations are expressed in prefix notation, meaning that the operator precedes its operands. This allows for complex expressions to be constructed easily, such as `( + ( * 2 3 ) ( - 10 5 ) )`, which evaluates to `11`.\n\nOverall, Scheme provides a robust set of mathematical functions that facilitate a wide range of numerical computations.
