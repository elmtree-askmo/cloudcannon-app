    To provide a detailed explanation of Example 1 in solving triangles, we can refer to the context of using the Law of Cosines, particularly in a practical scenario such as the engineering firm's bid for a proposed tunnel through a mountain.\n\n### Example 1: Tunnel Length Calculation\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nAn engineering firm needs to determine the length of a proposed tunnel through a mountain. To do this, they need to find the length of one side of a triangle formed by the tunnel and two reference points on either side of the mountain.\n\n**Given:**\n- The lengths of the two sides of the triangle (let's denote them as $ a $ and $ b $).\n- The angle $ C $ between these two sides.\n\n**Using the Law of Cosines:**\nThe Law of Cosines is particularly useful in this scenario because it allows us to calculate the length of the third side $ c $ of the triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides and the included angle. The formula is given by:\n\n$$\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)\n$$\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n1. **Identify the Values:**\n   - Letâ€™s assume $ a = 500 $ meters, $ b = 300 $ meters, and $ C = 60^\circ $.\n\n2. **Convert the Angle to Radians (if necessary):**\n   - In many calculations, angles should be in radians. However, for cosine calculations, degrees can be used directly if the calculator is set to degree mode.\n\n3. **Calculate $ c^2 $:**\n   - Substitute the known values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n   $$\n   c^2 = 500^2 + 300^2 - 2 \cdot 500 \cdot 300 \cdot \cos(60^\circ)\n   $$\n   - Since \( \cos(60^\circ) = 0.5 \):\n   $$\n   c^2 = 250000 + 90000 - 2 \cdot 500 \cdot 300 \cdot 0.5\n   $$\n   $$\n   c^2 = 250000 + 90000 - 150000\n   $$\n   $$\n   c^2 = 250000 + 90000 - 150000 = 190000\n   $$\n\n4. **Calculate $ c $:**\n   - Take the square root of $ c^2 $:\n   $$\n   c = \sqrt{190000} \approx 435.89 \text{ meters}\n   $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe length of the tunnel, represented by side $ c $, is approximately 435.89 meters. This calculation allows the engineering firm to make an informed bid based on the estimated length of the tunnel.\n\n### Practical Applications:\nThis example illustrates how the Law of Cosines can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as engineering and construction, where precise measurements are crucial for project planning and cost estimation. Understanding how to solve triangles using trigonometric laws is essential for professionals in fields that require spatial analysis and geometric calculations.
