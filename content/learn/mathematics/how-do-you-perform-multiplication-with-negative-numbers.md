    How do you perform multiplication with negative numbers?
answer: >-
    To perform multiplication with negative numbers, you need to follow a few simple rules regarding the signs of the numbers involved. Here’s a breakdown of how multiplication works with negative numbers:\n\n1. **Negative times Positive**: When you multiply a negative number by a positive number, the result is always negative. For example:\n   $$ \n   -2 \times 3 = -6 \n   $$\n\n2. **Positive times Negative**: Similarly, when you multiply a positive number by a negative number, the result is also negative. The order of multiplication does not affect the outcome:\n   $$ \n   3 \times -2 = -6 \n   $$\n\n3. **Negative times Negative**: When you multiply two negative numbers together, the result is positive. This is because the negative signs cancel each other out. For example:\n   $$ \n   -2 \times -3 = 6 \n   $$\n\n   To understand this concept better, you can visualize it on a number line. When you multiply by a negative number, you are effectively flipping the direction. Thus, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive outcome because the two flips cancel each other.\n\n4. **General Rule**: The overall rule to remember is:\n   - Negative × Positive = Negative\n   - Positive × Negative = Negative\n   - Negative × Negative = Positive\n\n5. **Counting Negative Signs**: If you have multiple numbers to multiply, you can count the number of negative signs:\n   - If there is an even number of negative signs, the result is positive.\n   - If there is an odd number of negative signs, the result is negative.\n\n### Examples:\n- Example 1: \n   $$ \n   -4 \times -5 = 20 \n   $$\n   (Both numbers are negative, so the result is positive.)\n\n- Example 2: \n   $$ \n   -3 \times 4 = -12 \n   $$\n   (One number is negative, so the result is negative.)\n\n- Example 3: \n   $$ \n   -6 \times -7 = 42 \n   $$\n   (Both numbers are negative, so the result is positive.)\n\nBy following these rules, you can effectively multiply negative numbers and understand the resulting signs of the products.
