    How do you perform synthetic division to divide polynomials?
answer: >-
    To perform synthetic division to divide polynomials, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomial and Divisor**: You need a polynomial of the form \( P(x) \) and a linear divisor of the form $ x - c $. For example, if you want to divide $ 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 5 $ by $ x - 1 $, then $ c = 1 $.\n\n2. **Set Up the Synthetic Division**: Write down the coefficients of the polynomial. For $ 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 0x - 5 $, the coefficients are $ [2, 3, 0, -5] $.\n\n3. **Write the Root of the Divisor**: Since you are dividing by $ x - c $, you will use $ c $ (in this case, $ 1 $) for the synthetic division.\n\n4. **Perform the Synthetic Division**:\n   - Write the coefficients in a row.\n   - Draw a horizontal line below them.\n   - Write the root $ c $ to the left of the coefficients.\n\n   The setup looks like this:\n\n   ```\n   1 |  2   3   0  -5\n     |      \n     |________________\n   ```\n\n5. **Bring Down the Leading Coefficient**: Bring down the first coefficient (2) directly below the line.\n\n   ```\n   1 |  2   3   0  -5\n     |      \n     |________________\n       |  2\n   ```\n\n6. **Multiply and Add**: Multiply the number you just brought down (2) by $ c $ (1) and write the result under the next coefficient (3). Then add the two numbers together.\n\n   ```\n   1 |  2   3   0  -5\n     |      2\n     |________________\n       |  2   5\n   ```\n\n   Repeat this process for the remaining coefficients:\n\n   - Multiply $ 5 $ by $ 1 $ and add to $ 0 $:\n   ```\n   1 |  2   3   0  -5\n     |      2   5\n     |________________\n       |  2   5   5\n   ```\n\n   - Multiply $ 5 $ by $ 1 $ and add to $ -5 $:\n   ```\n   1 |  2   3   0  -5\n     |      2   5   5\n     |________________\n       |  2   5   5   0\n   ```\n\n7. **Interpret the Result**: The last number (0) is the remainder, and the numbers above it (2, 5, 5) represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial. Therefore, the result of the division is:\n\n   $$ 2x^2 + 5x + 5 $$ with a remainder of $ 0 $.\n\nIn summary, synthetic division is a streamlined method for dividing polynomials that simplifies the process significantly compared to long division. The final result gives you both the quotient and the remainder, allowing you to express the division in polynomial form.
