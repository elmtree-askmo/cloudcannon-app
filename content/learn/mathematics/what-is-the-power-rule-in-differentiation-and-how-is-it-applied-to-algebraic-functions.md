    The power rule in differentiation is a fundamental technique for finding derivatives of algebraic functions of the form f(x) = x^n, stating that the derivative f'(x) = n*x^(n-1). It simplifies the differentiation process for polynomial expressions and applies to functions with various types of exponents.

answer: >-
    The power rule in differentiation is a fundamental technique used to differentiate algebraic functions of the form \( f(x) = x^n \), where $ n $ is any real number. The power rule states that the derivative of $ x^n $ is given by:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}\n$$\n\nThis means that to differentiate a function where the variable $ x $ is raised to a power $ n $, you multiply the entire expression by the exponent $ n $ and then decrease the exponent by 1.\n\n### Application of the Power Rule\n\nTo apply the power rule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the exponent**: Determine the value of $ n $ in the expression $ x^n $.\n2. **Multiply by the exponent**: Take the exponent $ n $ and multiply it by the expression.\n3. **Reduce the exponent**: Decrease the exponent by 1.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's differentiate the function \( f(x) = x^4 \) using the power rule.\n\n1. **Identify the exponent**: Here, $ n = 4 $.\n2. **Apply the power rule**: According to the power rule:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 4 \cdot x^{4-1} = 4 \cdot x^3\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the derivative of the function \( f(x) = x^4 \) is:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = 4x^3\n$$\n\nThis example illustrates how the power rule simplifies the differentiation process for polynomial functions. The power rule can also be applied to functions with negative or fractional exponents, making it a versatile tool in calculus. For instance, if you have \( f(x) = x^{-2} \), applying the power rule gives:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = -2 \cdot x^{-2-1} = -2 \cdot x^{-3} = -\frac{2}{x^3}\n$$\n\nIn summary, the power rule is a straightforward and powerful method for differentiating algebraic functions, allowing for quick calculations of derivatives for a wide range of polynomial expressions.
