    What are the key properties of exponential functions?
answer: >-
    Exponential functions are a fundamental class of mathematical functions characterized by their unique properties and behaviors. Here are the key properties of exponential functions:\n\n1. **General Form**: An exponential function can be expressed in the form \( f(x) = a \cdot b^x \), where:\n   - \( a \) is a constant (the initial value or y-intercept),\n   - \( b \) is the base of the exponential function (a positive constant),\n   - \( x \) is the variable exponent.\n\n2. **Domain and Range**:\n   - The **domain** of an exponential function is all real numbers, denoted as \( (-\infty, \infty) \).\n   - The **range** is always positive, specifically \( (0, \infty) \). This means that the function never takes on a value of zero or negative values.\n\n3. **Y-Intercept**: The graph of an exponential function always crosses the y-axis at the point \( (0, a) \). For the standard exponential function \( f(x) = b^x \), the y-intercept is \( (0, 1) \) when \( a = 1 \).\n\n4. **Asymptote**: Exponential functions have a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \). This means that as \( x \) approaches negative infinity, the value of \( f(x) \) approaches zero but never actually reaches it.\n\n5. **Behavior of the Graph**:\n   - If \( b > 1 \), the function exhibits **exponential growth**, meaning the graph increases rapidly as \( x \) increases.\n   - If \( 0 < b < 1 \), the function exhibits **exponential decay**, meaning the graph decreases rapidly as \( x \) increases.\n\n6. **One-to-One Function**: Exponential functions are one-to-one, meaning they pass the horizontal line test. This implies that for every value of \( y \) in the range, there is exactly one corresponding value of \( x \) in the domain.\n\n7. **Transformation Properties**: The parameters \( a \) and \( b \) can be adjusted to transform the graph:\n   - Changing \( a \) affects the vertical stretch or compression and the y-intercept.\n   - Changing \( b \) affects the growth or decay rate of the function.\n\n8. **Key Points**: The function will always take the value of 1 at \( x = 0 \) (i.e., \( f(0) = 1 \)), and it will never be zero (i.e., \( f(x) \neq 0 \) for all \( x \)).\n\nThese properties distinguish exponential functions from linear and quadratic functions, particularly in their growth rates and the shapes of their graphs. Understanding these characteristics is essential for solving exponential equations and applying them in various real-world contexts, such as compound interest calculations and population growth models.
