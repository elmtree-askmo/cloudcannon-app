    How do line segments and points behave when rotated on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    When line segments and points are rotated on the coordinate plane, their coordinates change according to specific transformation rules based on the angle of rotation. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this works:\n\n### Basic Concepts of Rotation\n\n1. **Center of Rotation**: The point around which the rotation occurs, commonly the origin (0,0) in the coordinate plane.\n\n2. **Angle of Rotation**: The degree measure of the rotation, which can be clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n3. **Isometric Transformation**: A rotation is an isometric transformation, meaning the original figure and its image after rotation are congruent (they have the same shape and size).\n\n### Rotation Rules\n\nThe transformation rules for rotating points around the origin are as follows:\n\n- **90° Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n  - The coordinates of a point \((x, y)\) transform to \((-y, x)\).\n  \n- **180° Rotation**:\n  - The coordinates transform to \((-x, -y)\). This applies for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.\n\n- **270° Counterclockwise Rotation (or 90° Clockwise)**:\n  - The coordinates transform to \((y, -x)\).\n\n### Behavior of Line Segments\n\nWhen a line segment is rotated, each endpoint of the segment is transformed according to the rotation rules. For example, consider a line segment with endpoints A(2,0) and B(4,0):\n\n- **After a 90° Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n  - A(2,0) becomes A'(-0, 2) or A'(0, 2).\n  - B(4,0) becomes B'(-0, 4) or B'(0, 4).\n  \n- **After a 180° Rotation**:\n  - A(2,0) becomes A'(-2,0).\n  - B(4,0) becomes B'(-4,0).\n\n- **After a 270° Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n  - A(2,0) becomes A'(0,-2).\n  - B(4,0) becomes B'(0,-4).\n\n### Projection onto the Axes\n\nAfter rotation, the images of the line segments can also be projected onto the x-axis or y-axis. For instance, if A'B' is the image of line segment AB after a rotation, projecting A'B' onto the x-axis would involve taking the x-coordinates of A' and B' and setting their y-coordinates to zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, when points and line segments are rotated on the coordinate plane, their coordinates change according to specific rules based on the angle of rotation. The transformation preserves the distances and angles, ensuring that the original figure and its image remain congruent. Understanding these rules allows for predicting the new positions of points and line segments after rotation.
