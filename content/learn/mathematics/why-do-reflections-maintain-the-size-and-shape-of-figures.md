    Why do reflections maintain the size and shape of figures?
answer: >-
    Reflections maintain the size and shape of figures due to the nature of the transformation itself, which is classified as an isometric transformation. This means that during a reflection, the distances between points in the original figure (pre-image) and the reflected figure (image) are preserved. Here are the key reasons why reflections maintain size and shape:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: The line of reflection acts as a mirror. When a figure is reflected across this line, each point of the figure is mapped to a corresponding point on the opposite side of the line, maintaining equal distances from the line. This ensures that the overall dimensions of the figure remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent. Congruent figures have the same size and shape, which means that all corresponding sides and angles are equal. This property is fundamental to reflections, as the transformation does not alter the geometric properties of the figure.\n\n3. **Isometric Transformation**: As an isometric transformation, reflection preserves distances. For any two points in the original figure, the distance between them remains the same in the reflected figure. This preservation of distance is crucial for maintaining the size and shape of the figure.\n\n4. **Orientation**: While reflections do reverse the orientation of the figure (for example, a left-facing object becomes right-facing), they do not change the size or shape. The angles and lengths of sides remain constant, which is why the reflected image is congruent to the original.\n\nIn summary, reflections maintain the size and shape of figures because they are isometric transformations that preserve distances and congruence, while only altering the orientation of the figure. This property is widely utilized in various fields, including geometry, computer graphics, and physics, to model symmetrical properties and behaviors.
