    What is function notation and how is it used in mathematical expressions?
answer: >-
    Function notation is a systematic way of representing functions using symbols, which is essential for expressing mathematical relationships clearly and concisely. In function notation, a function is typically denoted by a letter (commonly $f$, $g$, or $h$) followed by the input variable in parentheses. For example, \(f(x)\) represents a function named $f$ with $x$ as the input variable.\n\nThe general form of function notation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \text{expression involving } x\n$$\n\nFor instance, if we have the function defined as \(f(x) = 2x + 3\), we can evaluate this function at a specific value of $x$. If we want to find \(f(2)\), we substitute $2$ for $x$:\n\n$$\nf(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\n$$\n\nThis evaluation shows how function notation allows us to easily reference the function and compute its output for different input values.\n\nUnderstanding function notation is crucial in various areas of mathematics, including algebra and calculus, as it provides a clear framework for discussing functions, their properties, and their transformations. It also facilitates communication about mathematical concepts, making it easier to work with complex expressions and relationships.
