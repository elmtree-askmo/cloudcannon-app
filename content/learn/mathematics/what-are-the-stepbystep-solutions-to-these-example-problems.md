answer: >-
    To provide step-by-step solutions to example problems related to distance and displacement, as well as average speed and average velocity, we can break down the process into clear steps. Below are a few example problems along with their solutions.\n\n### Example Problem 1: Displacement and Distance Traveled\n**Problem Statement:** The velocity of an object moving along a line is given by \( v(t) = 2t^2 - 3t + 1 \) feet per second. Find the displacement of the object as \( t \) varies in the interval \( 0 \leq t \leq 3 \) and the total distance traveled during this interval.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Find the Displacement:**\n   - To find the displacement, we need to evaluate the definite integral of the velocity function over the given interval:\n   $$\n   \text{Displacement} = \int_{0}^{3} v(t) \, dt = \int_{0}^{3} (2t^2 - 3t + 1) \, dt\n   $$\n   - Calculate the integral:\n   $$\n   = \left[ \frac{2}{3}t^3 - \frac{3}{2}t^2 + t \right]_{0}^{3}\n   $$\n   - Evaluating at the bounds:\n   $$\n   = \left( \frac{2}{3}(3)^3 - \frac{3}{2}(3)^2 + 3 \right) - \left( 0 \right)\n   $$\n   $$\n   = \left( 18 - 13.5 + 3 \right) = 7.5 \text{ feet}\n   $$\n\n2. **Find the Total Distance Traveled:**\n   - First, find when the velocity changes sign by setting \( v(t) = 0 \):\n   $$\n   2t^2 - 3t + 1 = 0\n   $$\n   - Use the quadratic formula:\n   $$\n   t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3 \pm 1}{4}\n   $$\n   - This gives \( t = 1 \) and \( t = 0.5 \).\n\n   - Now, calculate the total distance by integrating the absolute value of the velocity:\n   $$\n   \text{Total Distance} = \int_{0}^{0.5} |v(t)| \, dt + \int_{0.5}^{3} |v(t)| \, dt\n   $$\n   - Evaluate each integral separately, ensuring to account for the sign of \( v(t) \) in each interval.\n\n### Example Problem 2: Average Speed and Average Velocity\n**Problem Statement:** A car travels along a straight road to the east for 120 meters in 5 seconds, then goes west for 60 meters in 1 second. Determine the average speed and average velocity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Calculate Total Distance:**\n   - Distance traveled east = 120 meters\n   - Distance traveled west = 60 meters\n   - Total distance = \( 120 + 60 = 180 \) meters\n\n2. **Calculate Total Time:**\n   - Time taken to travel east = 5 seconds\n   - Time taken to travel west = 1 second\n   - Total time = \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) seconds\n\n3. **Calculate Average Speed:**\n   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time\n   $$\n   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{180 \text{ meters}}{6 \text{ seconds}} = 30 \text{ m/s}\n   $$\n\n4. **Calculate Displacement:**\n   - Displacement = Distance east - Distance west = \( 120 - 60 = 60 \) meters (to the east)\n\n5. **Calculate Average Velocity:**\n   - Average velocity = Displacement / Total time\n   $$\n   \text{Average Velocity} = \frac{60 \text{ meters}}{6 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ m/s} \text{ (to the east)}\n   $$\n\n### Example Problem 3: Circular Track\n**Problem Statement:** An athlete covers 3 rounds on a circular track of radius 50 m. Calculate the total distance and displacement traveled by him.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Calculate Total Distance:**\n   - Circumference of the track = \( 2\pi r = 2\pi(50) = 100\pi \) meters\n   - Total distance for 3 rounds = \( 3 \times 100\pi \approx 942.48 \) meters\n\n2. **Calculate Displacement:**\n   - Since the athlete returns to the starting point after 3 rounds, the displacement is 0 meters.\n\nThese examples illustrate the process of calculating distance, displacement, average speed, and average velocity, providing a clear understanding of the concepts involved.
