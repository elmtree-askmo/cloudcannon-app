    What is the formula for calculating the average rate of change, and how is it interpreted?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the average rate of change of a function over a specified interval $[a, b]$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nIn this formula:\n- \(f(a)\) is the value of the function at the starting point $a$,\n- \(f(b)\) is the value of the function at the endpoint $b$,\n- $b - a$ represents the change in the input variable.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe average rate of change measures how much the output of the function changes per unit of input over the interval from $a$ to $b$. It can be thought of as the slope of the secant line that connects the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\) on the graph of the function. \n\nFor example, if a car travels 100 miles in 2 hours, the average rate of change of distance with respect to time can be calculated as:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{100 - 0}{2 - 0} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that, on average, the car traveled 50 miles for each hour of travel during that time interval.\n\n### Applications\nThe average rate of change is a fundamental concept in various fields, including physics, economics, and biology, as it helps analyze trends and changes over time. It is particularly useful for understanding how quantities relate to one another in real-world scenarios, such as speed, growth rates, and other dynamic processes. \n\nIn summary, the average rate of change provides a clear and quantifiable way to assess how a function behaves over a specific interval, making it an essential tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
