    What defines a homogeneous linear system?
answer: >-
    A homogeneous linear system is defined as a system of linear equations in which all of the constant terms are zero. This means that the equations can be expressed in the form $ Ax = 0 $, where $ A $ is a matrix of coefficients and $ x $ is a vector of variables. \n\nKey characteristics of homogeneous linear systems include:\n\n1. **Consistency**: A homogeneous system is always consistent because the zero vector (the trivial solution) is always a solution to the system. This means that there is at least one solution, which is the trivial solution where all variables are equal to zero.\n\n2. **Types of Solutions**: Homogeneous systems can yield two types of solutions:\n   - **Trivial Solution**: This is the solution where all variables are set to zero, i.e., $ x_1 = x_2 = \ldots = x_n = 0 $.\n   - **Nontrivial Solutions**: These occur when there are free variables in the system, leading to infinitely many solutions. \n\n3. **Linear Combinations**: Any linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous system is also a solution. This property is fundamental in linear algebra and is used extensively in various applications.\n\n4. **Free Variables**: If a homogeneous system has at least one free variable, it will have infinitely many solutions. Conversely, if there are no free variables, the system will have a unique solution (the trivial solution).\n\n5. **Matrix Representation**: In matrix notation, a homogeneous system can be represented as:\n   $$\n   \begin{pmatrix}\n   c_{11} & c_{12} & \cdots & c_{1n} \\\n   c_{21} & c_{22} & \cdots & c_{2n} \\\n   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\n   c_{n1} & c_{n2} & \cdots & c_{nn}\n   \end{pmatrix}\n   \begin{pmatrix}\n   x_1 \\\n   x_2 \\\n   \vdots \\\n   x_n\n   \end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \begin{pmatrix}\n   0 \\\n   0 \\\n   \vdots \\\n   0\n   \end{pmatrix}\n   $$\n\nIn summary, a homogeneous linear system is a foundational concept in linear algebra, characterized by its structure, types of solutions, and properties that facilitate the study of linear equations and their applications across various fields.
