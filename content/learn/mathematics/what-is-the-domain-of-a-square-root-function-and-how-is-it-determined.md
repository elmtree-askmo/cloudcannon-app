    The domain of a square root function is the set of non-negative input values; it is defined as [0, âˆž) because the square root of negative numbers is not a real number.

    What is the domain of a square root function, and how is it determined?
answer: >-
    The domain of a square root function is the set of all input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. For the square root function defined as:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \sqrt{x}\n$$\n\nthe function is only defined for non-negative values of $x$. This is because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. Therefore, the domain of the square root function is:\n\n$$\n[0, \infty)\n$$\n\nThis means that $x$ must be greater than or equal to 0. \n\nTo summarize:\n- **Domain**: $x \geq 0$ or in interval notation, \([0, \infty)\).\n- **Range**: The output values (y-values) of the square root function are also non-negative, which means the range is also \([0, \infty)\).\n\nIn practical terms, this domain restriction is crucial in various applications, such as geometry and statistics, where square root functions are commonly used.
