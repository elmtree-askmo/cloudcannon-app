answer: >-
    The substitution method and the elimination method are two common techniques used to solve systems of linear equations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n### Substitution Method\nIn the substitution method, one variable is solved for in terms of the other variable(s) using one of the equations. This expression is then substituted into the other equation. The steps typically involve:\n1. Solving one of the equations for one variable.\n2. Substituting this expression into the other equation.\n3. Solving the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\n4. Substituting back to find the other variable.\n\nThis method is particularly useful when one of the equations is easily solvable for one variable, or when the coefficients are simple, avoiding fractions. However, it can become cumbersome if the equations involve complex coefficients or lead to fractional values.\n\n### Elimination Method\nThe elimination method, on the other hand, involves manipulating the equations to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations. This can be done by:\n1. Multiplying one or both equations by a suitable number to align coefficients.\n2. Adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.\n3. Solving for the remaining variable.\n4. Substituting back to find the other variable.\n\nThis method is often preferred when the coefficients are not conducive to easy substitution, as it can lead to simpler calculations. It is also more systematic for larger systems of equations.\n\n### Comparison\n- **Complexity**: The substitution method can be simpler when one variable is easily isolated, while the elimination method is often more straightforward for equations with larger coefficients or when dealing with multiple equations.\n- **Fractions**: Substitution can introduce fractions, which may complicate calculations. The elimination method can often avoid this by aligning coefficients.\n- **Flexibility**: The substitution method can be applied to both linear and non-linear systems, while the elimination method is primarily used for linear systems.\n\nIn summary, both methods are valid and will yield the same solution for a system of linear equations. The choice between them often depends on the specific equations involved and personal preference.
