    A cubic function is a polynomial of degree three with a standard form that allows it to have distinctive shapes characterized by turning points, x-intercepts, and varied end behaviors. It typically exhibits a range of behaviors including the possibility of multiple roots and an inflection point.

    Describe the general shape of a cubic function and its standard form.
answer: >-
    A cubic function is a polynomial function of degree three, typically expressed in the standard form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$. The graph of a cubic function has a distinctive shape characterized by its ability to have one or two turning points, which can lead to various forms of curvature.\n\n### General Shape of a Cubic Function\n\n1. **Turning Points**: A cubic function can have either one or two turning points. This means that the graph can change direction at most twice, leading to a shape that can be either "S"-shaped or have a single inflection point.\n\n2. **Intercepts**: The graph can cross the x-axis up to three times, which means it can have up to three real roots. The y-intercept is found by evaluating \(f(0) = d\).\n\n3. **End Behavior**: The end behavior of cubic functions is such that as $x$ approaches positive infinity, \(f(x)\) approaches positive infinity if $a > 0$ (the right side of the graph rises), and as $x$ approaches negative infinity, \(f(x)\) approaches negative infinity. Conversely, if $a < 0$, the right side of the graph falls as $x$ approaches positive infinity.\n\n4. **Inflection Point**: A cubic function has an inflection point where the concavity changes. For the function \(f(x) = x^3\), this inflection point occurs at the origin (0,0).\n\n### Domain and Range\n\nThe domain and range of cubic functions are both all real numbers, expressed as:\n\n- **Domain**: \((-\infty, \infty)\)\n- **Range**: \((-\infty, \infty)\)\n\n### Example\n\nAn example of a simple cubic function is:\n\n$$\nf(x) = x^3\n$$\n\nThis function has an inflection point at the origin and demonstrates the typical "S"-shaped curve of cubic functions.\n\nIn summary, cubic functions exhibit a variety of shapes and behaviors depending on the coefficients, but they consistently maintain the characteristics of having a degree of three, a domain and range of all real numbers, and the potential for multiple x-intercepts and turning points.
