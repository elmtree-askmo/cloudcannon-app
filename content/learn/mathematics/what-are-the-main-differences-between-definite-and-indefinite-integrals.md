    What are the main differences between definite and indefinite integrals?
answer: >-
    The main differences between definite and indefinite integrals can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Definite Integral**: A definite integral calculates the exact numerical value of the accumulated change or area under a curve of a function within a specific interval. It is represented as:\n     $$\n     \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n     $$\n     where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively.\n   - **Indefinite Integral**: An indefinite integral, also known as an antiderivative, finds the general form of a function whose derivative is the given function. It does not have specified limits and is represented as:\n     $$\n     \int f(x) \, dx\n     $$\n     The result includes a constant of integration \( C \), indicating a family of functions.\n\n2. **Output**:\n   - **Definite Integral**: The result of a definite integral is a specific numerical value, which represents the area under the curve between the limits \( a \) and \( b \).\n   - **Indefinite Integral**: The result of an indefinite integral is a function (or family of functions) that includes a constant \( C \). For example, if \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \), then:\n     $$\n     \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C\n     $$\n\n3. **Limits of Integration**:\n   - **Definite Integral**: It has upper and lower limits (e.g., \( a \) and \( b \)), which define the interval over which the area is calculated.\n   - **Indefinite Integral**: It does not have any limits of integration, meaning it represents a general solution without specific bounds.\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation**:\n   - **Definite Integral**: Geometrically, it represents the area under the curve of the function \( f(x) \) from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \).\n   - **Indefinite Integral**: It does not have a direct geometric interpretation as an area since it represents a family of functions rather than a specific value.\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n   - **Definite Integral**: Can be evaluated using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if \( F \) is an antiderivative of \( f \), then:\n     $$\n     \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n     $$\n   - **Indefinite Integral**: Requires finding the antiderivative of the function, which can involve various techniques of integration.\n\nIn summary, the key distinctions lie in the presence of limits, the nature of the output (specific value vs. family of functions), and their respective interpretations and methods of evaluation.
