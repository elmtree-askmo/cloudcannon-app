    How does the distributive property apply to multiplication in equations?
answer: >-
    The distributive property is a fundamental principle in mathematics that applies to multiplication over addition and subtraction. It states that for any numbers $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $:\n\n$$\nA \times (B + C) = (A \times B) + (A \times C)\n$$\n\nThis property allows us to simplify expressions and solve equations more easily by distributing the multiplier across the terms inside the parentheses.\n\n### Application of the Distributive Property\n\n1. **Multiplication Over Addition**: \n   For example, to solve the expression \( 4(2 + 4) \) using the distributive property, we can distribute $ 4 $ to both $ 2 $ and $ 4 $:\n   $$\n   4(2 + 4) = (4 \times 2) + (4 \times 4) = 8 + 16 = 24\n   $$\n\n2. **Multiplication Over Subtraction**: \n   Similarly, if we have an expression like \( 7(20 - 3) \), we can apply the distributive property as follows:\n   $$\n   7(20 - 3) = (7 \times 20) - (7 \times 3) = 140 - 21 = 119\n   $$\n\n3. **Solving Equations**: \n   The distributive property is particularly useful in solving algebraic equations. For instance, consider the equation \( 9(x - 5) = 81 \). We can distribute $ 9 $ to both $ x $ and $ -5 $:\n   $$\n   9x - 45 = 81\n   $$\n   From here, we can isolate $ x $ by adding $ 45 $ to both sides:\n   $$\n   9x = 126 \implies x = 14\n   $$\n\n4. **Complex Expressions**: \n   In more complex expressions, such as \( 3x^2(6x^3 + 2x^2) \), the distributive property allows us to multiply $ 3x^2 $ with each term inside the parentheses:\n   $$\n   3x^2(6x^3) + 3x^2(2x^2) = 18x^5 + 6x^4\n   $$\n\n### Summary\nThe distributive property is a powerful tool in arithmetic and algebra, enabling the simplification of expressions and the solving of equations by distributing a multiplier across terms within parentheses. This property not only streamlines calculations but also enhances understanding of the relationships between numbers and variables in mathematical expressions.
