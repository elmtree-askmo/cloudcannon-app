    What are the common methods used to simplify ratios?
answer: >-
    To simplify ratios, several common methods can be employed:\n\n1. **Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: This is one of the most straightforward methods. You first determine the GCF of the two numbers in the ratio. Then, divide both numbers by this factor. For example, in the ratio 15:21, the GCF is 3. Dividing both terms by 3 gives you the simplified ratio of 5:7.\n\n2. **Dividing by the Same Number**: You can also simplify a ratio by dividing both parts by the same non-zero number. For instance, the ratio 9:3 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 3, resulting in 3:1.\n\n3. **Using Multiples for Decimals**: If the ratio involves decimals, you can multiply all terms by a power of 10 (like 10, 100, or 1000) to convert them into whole numbers. After converting, you can then find the GCF and simplify as usual. For example, to simplify the ratio 0.2:1.6, you could multiply both terms by 10 to get 2:16, which simplifies to 1:8.\n\n4. **Factoring**: Another method is to factor both numbers in the ratio and then identify the GCF from the factors. After finding the GCF, divide both numbers by it to achieve the simplified form.\n\n5. **Using Timetables**: Familiarity with multiplication tables can help in quickly identifying common factors. For example, knowing that both 21 and 14 are multiples of 7 allows you to simplify the ratio 21:14 to 3:2 easily.\n\nBy applying these methods, you can effectively simplify ratios to their simplest forms, making them easier to understand and compare.
