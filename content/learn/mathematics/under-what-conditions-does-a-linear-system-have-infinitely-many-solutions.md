    A linear system has infinitely many solutions when it is consistent, contains free variables, and typically has fewer equations than variables, allowing for an infinite set of solutions.

    Under what conditions does a linear system have infinitely many solutions?
answer: >-
    A linear system has infinitely many solutions under the following conditions:\n\n1. **Presence of Free Variables**: If the system has one or more free variables, it indicates that there are infinitely many solutions. Free variables are those that do not correspond to a pivot position in the row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the system. For example, if the RREF of a system looks like this:\n\n   $$\n   \begin{bmatrix}\n   1 & 2 & 0 & | & 3 \\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & | & 4\n   \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n   Here, $ x_2 $ is a free variable, meaning it can take any value, leading to infinitely many solutions expressed in terms of $ x_2 $.\n\n2. **Consistent System**: The system must be consistent, meaning that there is at least one solution. If the system is inconsistent (for example, if there is a row in the augmented matrix that has all zeros in the coefficient part but a non-zero constant), it will have no solutions.\n\n3. **Fewer Equations than Variables**: If the number of equations is less than the number of variables, it often leads to free variables, which in turn results in infinitely many solutions. For instance, consider the system:\n\n   1. $ x + y + z = 1 $\n   2. $ 2y + 3z = 2 $\n\n   In this case, there are three variables but only two equations, allowing for free variables and thus infinitely many solutions.\n\nIn summary, a linear system will have infinitely many solutions if it is consistent and contains free variables, typically occurring when there are fewer equations than variables. Understanding these conditions is crucial for effectively solving linear systems.
