answer: >-
    To minimize the cost of constructing a rectangular pen, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Variables\nLet:\n- \( L \) = length of the pen\n- \( W \) = width of the pen\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Area Constraint\nIf the total area of the pen is given (for example, 336 square meters), you can set up the equation:\n$$\nL \times W = 336\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Express the Cost Function\nThe total cost of the fencing can be expressed as a function of the dimensions. If the cost of the exterior fencing is $15.60 per meter and the interior fencing (if applicable) is $13.00 per meter, the cost function can be formulated as:\n$$\n\text{Total Cost} = (2L + 2W) \times 15.60 + 2L \times 13.00\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Substitute to Reduce Variables\nUsing the area constraint, you can express one variable in terms of the other. For instance, from the area equation, you can express \( W \) as:\n$$\nW = \frac{336}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the cost function allows you to express the total cost as a function of a single variable \( L \).\n\n### Step 5: Differentiate the Cost Function\nTo find the minimum cost, take the derivative of the cost function with respect to \( L \) and set it to zero:\n$$\n\frac{d(\text{Total Cost})}{dL} = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Solve for Critical Points\nSolve the equation obtained from the derivative to find the critical points. This will give you the potential dimensions that minimize the cost.\n\n### Step 7: Verify Minimum Cost\nTo ensure that the critical points found are indeed a minimum, you can use the second derivative test. If the second derivative is positive at the critical point, then it is a minimum.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Dimensions\nOnce you have the optimal value of \( L \), substitute it back into the area constraint to find \( W \).\n\n### Example\nFor instance, if you find that the optimal dimensions are \( L = 22 \) meters and \( W = 12 \) meters, you can then calculate the total cost using the cost function.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these structured steps, you can effectively minimize the cost of constructing a rectangular pen while adhering to any area constraints. This methodical approach is crucial in optimization problems, ensuring that all necessary conditions are satisfied while seeking the best solution.
