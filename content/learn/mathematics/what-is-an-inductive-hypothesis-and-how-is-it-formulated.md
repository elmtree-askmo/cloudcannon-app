    An inductive hypothesis is essential in mathematical induction, formulated by assuming a statement holds true for a specific natural number k. This process involves identifying the statement, establishing a base case, and proving the statement for k+1 using the assumption.

    What is an inductive hypothesis and how is it formulated?
answer: >-
    An inductive hypothesis is a crucial component of the mathematical induction process, which is a method used to prove statements about natural numbers. It is formulated during the inductive step of the proof, where we assume that a certain statement \(P(k)\) is true for a specific natural number $k$. This assumption is referred to as the inductive hypothesis.\n\n### Formulation of the Inductive Hypothesis\n\n1. **Identify the Statement**: First, you need to clearly define the statement \(P(n)\) that you want to prove is true for all integers $n \geq a$.\n\n2. **Base Case**: Before formulating the inductive hypothesis, you must establish a base case, typically showing that \(P(a)\) is true. This serves as the foundation for the induction.\n\n3. **Assume the Statement is True for $k$**: In the inductive step, you assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number $k$. This assumption is your inductive hypothesis:\n   $$ P(k) \text{ is true.} $$\n\n4. **Prove for $k + 1$**: Using the inductive hypothesis, you then show that if \(P(k)\) is true, it must also be true for $k + 1$:\n   $$ P(k + 1) \text{ is true.} $$\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If both the base case and the inductive step are successfully proven, you can conclude that the statement \(P(n)\) is true for all integers $n \geq a$.\n\n### Example\n\nFor instance, if you want to prove the formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers:\n$$\nP(n): 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n$$\n\n- **Base Case**: For $n = 1$:\n  $$ 1 = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1 \text{ (true)} $$\n\n- **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume \(P(k)\) is true:\n  $$ 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} $$\n\n- **Inductive Step**: Show \(P(k + 1)\) is true:\n  $$ 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1) $$\n  Simplifying the right side:\n  $$ = \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} $$\n  Thus, \(P(k + 1)\) holds true.\n\nBy completing these steps, you have successfully formulated and utilized the inductive hypothesis to prove the statement for all natural numbers $n \geq 1$.
