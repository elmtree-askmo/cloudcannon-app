    What changes occur when reflecting a point across both axes?
answer: >-
    When reflecting a point across both the x-axis and the y-axis, the changes to the coordinates can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Reflection across the x-axis**: When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the x-axis, the x-coordinate remains the same while the y-coordinate changes sign. Therefore, the reflection of the point \((x, y)\) across the x-axis is given by:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)\n   $$\n\n2. **Reflection across the y-axis**: When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the y-axis, the y-coordinate remains the same while the x-coordinate changes sign. Thus, the reflection of the point \((x, y)\) across the y-axis is:\n   $$\n   (x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y)\n   $$\n\n3. **Combined reflection across both axes**: If we first reflect a point across the x-axis and then across the y-axis, we can combine these transformations. Starting with the point \((x, y)\):\n   - Reflecting across the x-axis gives us \((x, -y)\).\n   - Then reflecting \((x, -y)\) across the y-axis results in:\n   $$\n   (x, -y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n   $$\n\nThus, the final coordinates of the point after reflecting across both the x-axis and the y-axis are:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n$$\n\nFor example, if we take the point \((4, 5)\):\n- Reflecting across the x-axis gives \((4, -5)\).\n- Reflecting \((4, -5)\) across the y-axis gives \((-4, -5)\).\n\nIn summary, reflecting a point across both axes results in negating both coordinates of the original point.
