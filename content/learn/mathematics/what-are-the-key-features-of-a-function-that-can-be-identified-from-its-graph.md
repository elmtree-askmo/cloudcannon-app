    What are the key features of a function that can be identified from its graph?
answer: >-
    The key features of a function that can be identified from its graph include:\n\n1. **Shape**: The overall appearance of the graph, which can indicate the type of function (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.). For example, a quadratic function like $ y = x^2 $ has a parabolic shape.\n\n2. **Vertex**: For functions such as quadratics, the vertex is the highest or lowest point on the graph. For $ y = x^2 $, the vertex is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).\n\n3. **Intercepts**: These are points where the graph intersects the axes. The x-intercepts (where $ y = 0 $) and y-intercepts (where $ x = 0 $) provide critical information about the function's behavior.\n\n4. **Axis of Symmetry**: Many functions, particularly even functions like quadratics, have an axis of symmetry. For $ y = x^2 $, the axis of symmetry is the line $ x = 0 $.\n\n5. **Domain and Range**: The domain is the set of all possible input values (x-values), while the range is the set of all possible output values (y-values). For $ y = x^2 $, the domain is all real numbers \( (-\infty, \infty) \), and the range is \( [0, \infty) \).\n\n6. **Increasing and Decreasing Intervals**: Identifying where the function is increasing or decreasing helps understand its behavior. For $ y = x^2 $, the function decreases on \( (-\infty, 0) \) and increases on \( (0, \infty) \).\n\n7. **Maximum and Minimum Values**: The highest or lowest points on the graph indicate the maximum or minimum values of the function. The minimum value of $ y = x^2 $ is at the vertex \( (0, 0) \).\n\n8. **End Behavior**: This describes how the function behaves as $ x $ approaches positive or negative infinity. For $ y = x^2 $, as $ x $ approaches $ \pm \infty $, $ y $ approaches $ \infty $.\n\n9. **Asymptotes**: For certain functions, such as rational functions, asymptotes indicate lines that the graph approaches but never touches. Quadratic functions do not have asymptotes.\n\n10. **Transformations**: Any shifts, stretches, or reflections of the graph from its parent function can be identified. For example, the function \( f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 1 \) represents a shift of the basic parabola $ y = x^2 $ to the right by 2 units and up by 1 unit.\n\nBy analyzing these features, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior and characteristics based on its graph.
