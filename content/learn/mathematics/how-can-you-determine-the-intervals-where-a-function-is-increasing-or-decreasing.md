answer: >-
    To determine the intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definitions**:\n   - A function \( f(x) \) is **increasing** on an interval if, for any two points $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ in that interval, where $ x_1 < x_2 $, it holds that \( f(x_1) < f(x_2) \). This indicates that as you move from left to right along the x-axis, the y-values of the function are rising.\n   - Conversely, a function is **decreasing** on an interval if \( f(x_1) > f(x_2) \) for $ x_1 < x_2 $, meaning that the y-values are falling as you move right.\n\n2. **Use the First Derivative**:\n   - The most common method to find intervals of increase and decrease is to use the first derivative of the function, \( f'(x) \).\n   - If \( f'(x) > 0 \) on an interval, then the function is increasing on that interval.\n   - If \( f'(x) < 0 \) on an interval, then the function is decreasing on that interval.\n   - If \( f'(x) = 0 \), this may indicate a local maximum or minimum, and further analysis is needed.\n\n3. **Find Critical Points**:\n   - Calculate the first derivative \( f'(x) \) and set it equal to zero to find critical points. These points are where the function may change from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.\n   - Additionally, check the endpoints of the domain if the function is defined on a closed interval.\n\n4. **Test Intervals**:\n   - Divide the number line into intervals based on the critical points found in the previous step.\n   - Choose a test point from each interval and evaluate the sign of the first derivative at that point.\n   - Based on the sign of \( f'(x) \) at the test points, determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing in those intervals.\n\n5. **Summarize the Results**:\n   - Compile the intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing based on your findings from the derivative tests.\n\n### Example:\nConsider the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4 \).\n\n1. Find the first derivative:\n   $$ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x - 2) $$\n\n2. Set the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n   $$ 3x(x - 2) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = 2 $$\n\n3. Test intervals:\n   - Intervals: \( (-\infty, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), \( (2, \infty) \)\n   - Choose test points: $ x = -1 $, $ x = 1 $, $ x = 3 $\n   - Evaluate \( f'(-1) \), \( f'(1) \), and \( f'(3) \):\n     - \( f'(-1) = 3(-1)(-1 - 2) = 9 > 0 \) (increasing)\n     - \( f'(1) = 3(1)(1 - 2) = -3 < 0 \) (decreasing)\n     - \( f'(3) = 3(3)(3 - 2) = 9 > 0 \) (increasing)\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The function is increasing on the intervals \( (-\infty, 0) \) and \( (2, \infty) \).\n   - The function is decreasing on the interval \( (0, 2) \).\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing.
