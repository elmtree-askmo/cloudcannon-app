    How do you determine if a graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis?
answer: >-
    To determine if a graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, you can use the following algebraic test:\n\n1. **Identify a Point**: Start with a point \((x, y)\) that lies on the graph of the function.\n\n2. **Check for Symmetry**: For the graph to be symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the point \((x, -y)\) must also be on the graph. This means that if you reflect the point across the x-axis, it should still lie on the graph.\n\n3. **Algebraic Test**: To perform an algebraic test, take the equation of the graph and replace \(y\) with \(-y\). If the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation, then the graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis. If the equations are not equivalent, then the graph is not symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nFor example, consider the equation \(y = x^2 - 6x^4 + 2\). To test for x-axis symmetry, replace \(y\) with \(-y\):\n\n$$\n-y = x^2 - 6x^4 + 2\n$$\n\nIf you can manipulate this equation to return to the original form, then the graph is symmetric about the x-axis. If not, it is not symmetric.\n\nIn summary, a graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if for every point \((x, y)\) on the graph, the point \((x, -y)\) is also on the graph, which can be verified through the algebraic test of replacing \(y\) with \(-y\) in the equation.
