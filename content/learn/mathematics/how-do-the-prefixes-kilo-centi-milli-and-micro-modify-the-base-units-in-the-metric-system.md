    How do the prefixes kilo, centi, milli, and micro modify the base units in the metric system?
answer: >-
    In the metric system, prefixes are used to modify base units by indicating specific powers of ten, which allows for easy scaling of measurements. Here’s how the prefixes kilo, centi, milli, and micro modify the base units:\n\n1. **Kilo- (k)**: This prefix denotes a factor of $10^3$, or 1,000 times the base unit. For example:\n   - 1 kilometer (km) = 1,000 meters (m)\n   - 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 grams (g)\n\n2. **Centi- (c)**: This prefix indicates a factor of $10^{-2}$, or one-hundredth of the base unit. For example:\n   - 1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meters (m)\n   - 1 centigram (cg) = 0.01 grams (g)\n\n3. **Milli- (m)**: This prefix represents a factor of $10^{-3}$, or one-thousandth of the base unit. For example:\n   - 1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 meters (m)\n   - 1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 grams (g)\n\n4. **Micro- (µ)**: This prefix denotes a factor of $10^{-6}$, or one-millionth of the base unit. For example:\n   - 1 micrometer (µm) = 0.000001 meters (m)\n   - 1 microgram (µg) = 0.000001 grams (g)\n\nUnderstanding these prefixes is essential for converting between different metric units and for accurate measurement in scientific contexts. The use of these prefixes simplifies communication and calculations, allowing for a more straightforward representation of large or small quantities.
