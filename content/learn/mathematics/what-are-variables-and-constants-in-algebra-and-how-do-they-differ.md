    What are variables and constants in algebra, and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    In algebra, **variables** and **constants** are fundamental concepts that play distinct roles in mathematical expressions and equations.\n\n### Variables\nA variable is a symbol, often represented by letters such as $x$, $y$, or $z$, that stands for an unknown value or a value that can change. Variables are used to express relationships and can take on different values within a given context. For example, in the expression $4x + y$, both $x$ and $y$ are variables. The value of $x$ can vary, and consequently, the value of the entire expression can change based on the values assigned to $x$ and $y$.\n\n### Constants\nA constant, on the other hand, is a fixed value that does not change. In algebra, constants are often represented by numbers. For example, in the expression $3x + 5$, the number $5$ is a constant because it remains the same regardless of the value of $x$. Constants can also be represented as polynomials, such as $4$, which can be expressed as $4x^0$ (since any number raised to the power of zero is 1).\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Value Change**: \n   - **Variables** can change and represent a range of values.\n   - **Constants** have a fixed value that does not change.\n\n2. **Representation**:\n   - **Variables** are typically denoted by letters (e.g., $x$, $y$).\n   - **Constants** are usually represented by specific numbers (e.g., $3$, $5$).\n\n3. **Role in Expressions**:\n   - **Variables** allow for the expression of general relationships and can be manipulated in equations.\n   - **Constants** provide specific values that can be used in calculations.\n\n### Examples\n- In the expression $2x + 3$, $x$ is a variable, and $3$ is a constant.\n- In the polynomial $x^2 + 4x + 7$, $x$ is a variable, while $4$ and $7$ are constants.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between variables and constants is crucial for solving algebraic equations and working with algebraic expressions effectively.
