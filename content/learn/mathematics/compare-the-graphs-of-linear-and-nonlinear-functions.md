    Compare the graphs of linear and non-linear functions.
answer: >-
    When comparing the graphs of linear and non-linear functions, several key differences emerge that highlight their distinct characteristics and behaviors.\n\n### Linear Functions\n1. **Graph Shape**: Linear functions produce straight-line graphs. The general form of a linear function is \( f(x) = mx + b \), where $ m $ is the slope and $ b $ is the y-intercept.\n2. **Constant Rate of Change**: The rate of change (slope) is constant across all intervals. This means that for any two points on the line, the change in $ y $ divided by the change in $ x $ remains the same.\n3. **Key Features**:\n   - **Domain and Range**: Both the domain and range are all real numbers.\n   - **Intercepts**: The graph intersects the y-axis at $ b $ and the x-axis at $ -\frac{b}{m} $ (if $ m \neq 0 $).\n   - **Symmetry**: Linear functions are symmetric about the line $ y = x $ when reflected.\n\n### Non-Linear Functions\n1. **Graph Shape**: Non-linear functions can take various forms, including curves, peaks, and troughs. Common types include quadratic functions (e.g., \( f(x) = x^2 \)), exponential functions (e.g., \( f(x) = a \cdot b^x \)), and piecewise functions.\n2. **Variable Rate of Change**: The average rate of change for non-linear functions varies over different intervals. For instance, the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \) has different average rates of change over intervals such as [1, 2] and [2, 3].\n3. **Key Features**:\n   - **Domain and Range**: The domain and range can be restricted or infinite, depending on the function type. For example, the range of a quadratic function is typically \( [0, \infty) \) if it opens upwards.\n   - **Intercepts**: Non-linear functions can have multiple x-intercepts or none, depending on their shape.\n   - **Asymptotes**: Exponential functions often approach a horizontal asymptote, indicating that they get closer to a certain value but never actually reach it.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Graph Appearance**: Linear functions yield straight lines, while non-linear functions produce curves or other complex shapes.\n- **Rate of Change**: Linear functions have a constant rate of change, whereas non-linear functions exhibit a variable rate of change.\n- **Behavior Over Intervals**: The average rate of change for non-linear functions can differ significantly across intervals, reflecting their complexity.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for analyzing and applying various functions in mathematical modeling and real-world scenarios. For example, linear functions are often used to model constant growth or decay, while non-linear functions can represent more complex relationships, such as exponential growth in populations or quadratic relationships in physics.
