    Why are parentheses important in mathematical notation?
answer: >-
    Parentheses are crucial in mathematical notation for several reasons, particularly in ensuring clarity and accuracy in calculations. Here are the key points highlighting their importance:\n\n1. **Order of Operations**: Parentheses dictate the order in which operations are performed. According to the PEMDAS/BODMAS rules (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), expressions within parentheses are evaluated first. For example, in the expression \( (-3)^2 \), the parentheses indicate that the negative sign is part of the base, resulting in $ 9 $. Without parentheses, $ -3^2 $ would be evaluated as \( -(3^2) \), yielding $ -9 $. This illustrates how parentheses can significantly alter the outcome of an expression.\n\n2. **Exponentiation of Products**: When raising a product to a power, parentheses ensure that the exponent applies to each factor inside. For instance, \( (xy)^2 \) means both $ x $ and $ y $ are squared, resulting in $ x^2y^2 $. If written as $ xy^2 $, it would imply that only $ y $ is squared, leading to a different result.\n\n3. **Negative Exponents**: Parentheses clarify the base when dealing with negative exponents. For example, \( (3^{-2}) \) equals $ \frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9} $, while $ -3^{-2} $ equals $ -\frac{1}{3^2} = -\frac{1}{9} $. The parentheses ensure that the negative sign is treated correctly in relation to the exponent.\n\n4. **Complex Expressions**: In more complex expressions, parentheses help in simplifying calculations. For example, in \( (2 + 3)^2 \), you first calculate $ 2 + 3 = 5 $ and then square the result to get $ 25 $. Without parentheses, $ 2 + 3^2 $ would lead to $ 2 + 9 = 11 $, demonstrating how parentheses can change the order of operations and thus the final result.\n\nIn summary, parentheses are essential for ensuring that calculations are performed correctly, clarifying which numbers are included in operations, and dictating the order of operations. Their proper use is vital in avoiding misinterpretations and errors in mathematical expressions.
