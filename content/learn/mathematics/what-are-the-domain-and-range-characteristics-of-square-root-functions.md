    What are the domain and range characteristics of square root functions?
answer: >-
    The domain and range characteristics of square root functions are fundamental to understanding their behavior in mathematics. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\n### Domain of Square Root Functions\nThe domain of a square root function is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined. Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the input (x) must be non-negative. Therefore, the domain of a square root function can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Domain: } [0, \infty)\n$$\n\nThis means that the function is defined for all values of $ x $ that are greater than or equal to zero.\n\n### Range of Square Root Functions\nThe range of a square root function is the set of all possible output (y) values. Since the square root function produces non-negative outputs (the square root of any non-negative number is non-negative), the range can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Range: } [0, \infty)\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the output values start from zero and extend to positive infinity.\n\n### Summary\n- **Domain:** \( [0, \infty) \) (x-values must be non-negative)\n- **Range:** \( [0, \infty) \) (y-values are non-negative)\n\nThese characteristics are essential for graphing square root functions and understanding their properties in various mathematical contexts.
