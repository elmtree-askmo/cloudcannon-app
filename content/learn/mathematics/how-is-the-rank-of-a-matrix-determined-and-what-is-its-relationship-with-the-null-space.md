    How is the rank of a matrix determined, and what is its relationship with the null space?
answer: >-
    The rank of a matrix is a crucial concept in linear algebra, defined as the dimension of its column space. This dimension represents the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors in the matrix. To determine the rank, one can perform row reduction to obtain the row echelon form of the matrix and count the number of pivot columns. For instance, if a matrix has three pivot columns, its rank is 3.\n\nThe relationship between the rank of a matrix and its null space is articulated through the Rank-Nullity Theorem. This theorem states that for any matrix $ A $ of size $ m \times n $:\n\n$$\n\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- \( \text{rank}(A) \) is the dimension of the column space of the matrix $ A $, indicating the number of linearly independent columns.\n- \( \text{nullity}(A) \) is the dimension of the null space of $ A $, which corresponds to the number of solutions to the homogeneous equation $ Ax = 0 $.\n\n### Key Points of the Relationship:\n1. **Column Space**: The column space of a matrix $ A $ is the span of its column vectors, representing all possible linear combinations of those columns. The dimension of this space is the rank of the matrix.\n2. **Null Space**: The null space consists of all vectors $ x $ such that $ Ax = 0 $. The dimension of the null space is referred to as the nullity of the matrix, indicating the number of free variables in the solution to the equation $ Ax = 0 $.\n3. **Matrix Rank Theorem**: The matrix rank theorem reinforces the relationship between the rank and null space, expressed as:\n   $$\n   \text{rank}(A) + \text{dim}(\text{null}(A)) = n\n   $$\n   where $ n $ is the number of columns in $ A $.\n\n### Example\nConsider the matrix:\n$$\nA = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 \end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the rank, we can row reduce $ A $:\n1. The first row remains the same: \( (1, 2) \).\n2. The second row can be transformed by subtracting 3 times the first row from it, resulting in \( (0, 0) \).\n\nThe row echelon form of $ A $ is:\n$$\n\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHere, there is 1 pivot column, so the rank of $ A $ is 1. Since $ A $ has 2 columns, we can find the nullity:\n$$\n\text{nullity}(A) = n - \text{rank}(A) = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\n\nThus, the null space is one-dimensional, indicating there is one free variable in the solution to $ Ax = 0 $.\n\nIn summary, the rank of a matrix provides insight into the linear independence of its columns, while the null space reveals the solutions to the homogeneous system, with their relationship encapsulated in the Rank-Nullity Theorem.
