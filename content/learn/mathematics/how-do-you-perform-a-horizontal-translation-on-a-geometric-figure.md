    How do you perform a horizontal translation on a geometric figure?
answer: >-
    To perform a horizontal translation on a geometric figure, you follow a systematic approach that involves shifting the figure along the x-axis. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n### Steps for Horizontal Translation\n\n1. **Identify the Translation Value**: Determine the value $k$ by which you want to translate the figure. A positive $k$ indicates a shift to the right, while a negative $k$ indicates a shift to the left.\n\n2. **Apply the Translation Rule**: For each point \((x, y)\) of the geometric figure, apply the translation rule:\n   - The new coordinates after translation will be \((x + k, y)\).\n   - This means that only the x-coordinate changes, while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\n3. **Update All Points**: Repeat the translation for all points in the figure. If the figure consists of multiple points, ensure that each point is translated according to the same rule.\n\n4. **Draw the Translated Figure**: Once all points have been translated, plot the new points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form the translated figure.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a triangle with vertices at points \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), and \(C(5, 1)\), and you want to translate this triangle 4 units to the right.\n\n- For point $A$:\n  - New coordinates: \(A'(1 + 4, 2) = A'(5, 2)\)\n  \n- For point $B$:\n  - New coordinates: \(B'(3 + 4, 4) = B'(7, 4)\)\n  \n- For point $C$:\n  - New coordinates: \(C'(5 + 4, 1) = C'(9, 1)\)\n\nThe new vertices of the translated triangle will be \(A'(5, 2)\), \(B'(7, 4)\), and \(C'(9, 1)\).\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n- **Direction of Movement**: The direction of the translation is determined by the sign of $k$. Positive values move the figure to the right, while negative values move it to the left.\n- **Consistency**: All points in the figure must be translated by the same amount to maintain the figure's integrity.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively perform a horizontal translation on any geometric figure in the coordinate plane.
