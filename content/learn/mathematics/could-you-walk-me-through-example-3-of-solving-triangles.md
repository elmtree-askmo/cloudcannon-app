answer: >-
    To walk you through Example 3 of solving triangles, we will utilize the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines, depending on the information provided about the triangle. \n\n### Example 3: Solving a Triangle\n\nLet's assume we are given a triangle $ \Delta ABC $ with the following information:\n- Side $ a = 8 $ units\n- Side $ b = 6 $ units\n- Angle $ A = 45^\circ $\n\nSince we have two sides and the angle not included (SSA), we can use the Law of Sines to find the remaining angles and side.\n\n#### Step 1: Use the Law of Sines\n\nThe Law of Sines states that:\n\n$$\n\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n\n$$\n\frac{8}{\sin(45^\circ)} = \frac{6}{\sin B}\n$$\n\n#### Step 2: Solve for $ \sin B $\n\nFirst, calculate \( \sin(45^\circ) \):\n\n$$\n\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nNow substitute this value into the equation:\n\n$$\n\frac{8}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{6}{\sin B}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\frac{16}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{6}{\sin B}\n$$\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n$$\n16 \sin B = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\sin B = \frac{6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{16} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{16}\n$$\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate Angle $ B $\n\nNow, we can find angle $ B $ using the inverse sine function:\n\n$$\nB = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{16}\right)\n$$\n\nThis will yield a specific angle, but remember that there may be two possible angles for $ B $ (acute and obtuse) since $ \sin B $ can yield two angles in the range of $ 0^\circ $ to $ 180^\circ $.\n\n#### Step 4: Find Angle $ C $\n\nOnce we have angle $ B $, we can find angle $ C $ using the triangle sum property:\n\n$$\nC = 180^\circ - A - B\n$$\n\n#### Step 5: Find Side $ c $\n\nFinally, we can use the Law of Sines again to find side $ c $:\n\n$$\n\frac{c}{\sin C} = \frac{8}{\sin(45^\circ)}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values will allow us to solve for $ c $.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis example illustrates how to apply the Law of Sines to solve a triangle when given two sides and a non-included angle. Depending on the values, you may need to consider the possibility of two different triangles (ambiguous case) when using the SSA condition.
