    How do coordinates change when a figure is reflected?
answer: >-
    When a figure is reflected across a specific line, the coordinates of the points that make up the figure change according to the line of reflection. The transformation maintains the size and shape of the figure, but the orientation is laterally inverted. Hereâ€™s how the coordinates change based on the line of reflection:\n\n### 1. Reflection over the x-axis:\nIf a point \( P(x, y) \) is reflected over the x-axis, the new coordinates will be:\n$$\nP'(x, -y)\n$$\nFor example, if the point \( (3, 4) \) is reflected over the x-axis, the new coordinates will be \( (3, -4) \).\n\n### 2. Reflection over the y-axis:\nIf a point \( P(x, y) \) is reflected over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be:\n$$\nP'(-x, y)\n$$\nFor instance, reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the y-axis results in the new coordinates \( (-3, 4) \).\n\n### 3. Reflection over the line $ y = x $:\nWhen reflecting a point \( P(x, y) \) over the line $ y = x $, the coordinates are swapped:\n$$\nP'(y, x)\n$$\nSo, reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the line $ y = x $ gives the new coordinates \( (4, 3) \).\n\n### 4. Reflection over the line $ y = -x $:\nFor reflection over the line $ y = -x $, the coordinates are also swapped and negated:\n$$\nP'(-y, -x)\n$$\nThus, reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the line $ y = -x $ results in the new coordinates \( (-4, -3) \).\n\n### Summary of Coordinate Changes:\n- **Over x-axis**: \( (x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y) \)\n- **Over y-axis**: \( (x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y) \)\n- **Over $ y = x $**: \( (x, y) \rightarrow (y, x) \)\n- **Over $ y = -x $**: \( (x, y) \rightarrow (-y, -x) \)\n\nThese transformations illustrate how the coordinates of a figure change when reflected across different lines, while ensuring that the figure remains congruent to its original form.
