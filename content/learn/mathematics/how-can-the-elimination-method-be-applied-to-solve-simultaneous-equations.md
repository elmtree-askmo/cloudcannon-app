    The elimination method is a systematic approach used to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations. Hereâ€™s how it can be applied step-by-step:\n\n### Steps to Solve Simultaneous Equations Using the Elimination Method\n\n1. **Write the Equations**: Start with the system of equations you want to solve. For example:\n   $$\n   x - y = 1 \quad (1)\n   $$\n   $$\n   x + y = 5 \quad (2)\n   $$\n\n2. **Align the Equations**: Ensure that the equations are aligned in a way that makes it easy to eliminate one of the variables. \n\n3. **Eliminate One Variable**: You can eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations. In our example, we can add both equations to eliminate $y$:\n   $$\n   (x - y) + (x + y) = 1 + 5\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   2x = 6\n   $$\n\n4. **Solve for the Remaining Variable**: Now, solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   x = 3\n   $$\n\n5. **Substitute Back to Find the Other Variable**: Substitute the value of $x$ back into one of the original equations to find $y$. Using equation (2):\n   $$\n   3 + y = 5\n   $$\n   Solving for $y$ gives:\n   $$\n   y = 2\n   $$\n\n6. **Write the Solution**: The solution to the system of equations is:\n   $$\n   (x, y) = (3, 2)\n   $$\n\n### Example with Different Coefficients\n\nConsider another example:\n$$\n2x + 3y = 6 \quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n4x - 3y = 12 \quad (2)\n$$\n\nTo eliminate $y$, you can add the two equations directly:\n$$\n(2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 6 + 12\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n6x = 18\n$$\nThus, solving for $x$:\n$$\nx = 3\n$$\n\nNow substitute $x = 3$ back into one of the original equations to find $y$:\n$$\n2(3) + 3y = 6 \implies 6 + 3y = 6 \implies 3y = 0 \implies y = 0\n$$\n\nThe solution for this system is:\n$$\n(x, y) = (3, 0)\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe elimination method is effective for solving systems of linear equations by strategically eliminating one variable, allowing for straightforward calculation of the remaining variable. This method is particularly useful when the coefficients of one variable can be easily manipulated to facilitate elimination.
