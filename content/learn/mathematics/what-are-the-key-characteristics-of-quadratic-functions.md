    What are the key characteristics of quadratic functions?
answer: >-
    Quadratic functions are a specific type of polynomial function characterized by their standard form, which is expressed as:\n\n$$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere $ a \neq 0 $. Here are the key characteristics of quadratic functions:\n\n1. **Direction of Opening**: The sign of the coefficient $ a $ determines the direction in which the parabola opens:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards.\n   - If $ a < 0 $, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex of a quadratic function is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on the direction of opening. The vertex can be found using the formula:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   Once the x-coordinate of the vertex is found, it can be substituted back into the function to find the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\n3. **Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, given by the equation:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   This line divides the parabola into two mirror-image halves.\n\n4. **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept of the quadratic function can be found by evaluating the function at $ x = 0 $:\n   $$\n   y = c\n   $$\n   This point is where the graph intersects the y-axis.\n\n5. **Shape**: The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, which is symmetric about the axis of symmetry. The general shape is U-shaped (for $ a > 0 $) or an upside-down U (for $ a < 0 $).\n\n6. **Domain and Range**:\n   - The domain of a quadratic function is all real numbers, \( (-\infty, \infty) \).\n   - The range depends on the vertex:\n     - If the parabola opens upwards, the range is \( [k, \infty) \) where $ k $ is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n     - If the parabola opens downwards, the range is $ (-\infty, k] $.\n\n7. **Intercepts**: In addition to the y-intercept, the x-intercepts (or roots) can be found by solving the equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ using methods such as factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n\nThese characteristics are essential for graphing quadratic functions and understanding their behavior in various mathematical contexts.
