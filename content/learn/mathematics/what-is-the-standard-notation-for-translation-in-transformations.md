    What is the standard notation for translation in transformations?
answer: >-
    The standard notation for translation in transformations is typically expressed as follows:\n\n$$\nT_{a,b}(x, y) \rightarrow (x + a, y + b)\n$$\n\nIn this notation, $T_{a,b}$ represents the translation transformation where $a$ is the horizontal shift (to the right if positive, to the left if negative) and $b$ is the vertical shift (up if positive, down if negative). The point \((x, y)\) is the original coordinate, and the result \((x + a, y + b)\) is the new coordinate after the translation.\n\nFor example, if you have a point \((2, 3)\) and you apply a translation of $T_{4, -2}$, the new coordinates would be:\n\n$$\n(2 + 4, 3 - 2) = (6, 1)\n$$\n\nThis notation clearly indicates the direction and magnitude of the translation applied to the geometric figure or point in the coordinate plane.
