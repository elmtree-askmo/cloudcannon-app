    Detailed examples play a crucial role in enhancing the understanding of the properties of equality. By applying these properties in practical scenarios, learners can see how abstract concepts translate into concrete problem-solving techniques. Here are several ways in which detailed examples can aid comprehension:\n\n1. **Illustration of Concepts**: Examples provide a visual representation of how properties of equality work. For instance, when solving the equation $5x - 10 = 5$, applying the addition property of equality helps to illustrate that if you add the same value to both sides of the equation, the equality remains intact. The step-by-step solution would look like this:\n   $$\n   5x - 10 + 10 = 5 + 10 \\\n   5x = 15 \\\n   x = 3\n   $$\n\n2. **Application of Different Properties**: Detailed examples can showcase various properties of equality, such as the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division properties. For instance, if we have $x - 3 = 7$, we can apply the addition property:\n   $$\n   x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3 \\\n   x = 10\n   $$\n   This demonstrates how each property can be used to isolate the variable and solve the equation.\n\n3. **Reinforcement of Learning**: By working through multiple examples, learners can reinforce their understanding of how to manipulate equations. For example, using the substitution property, if we know $x = 2$, we can substitute this value into the expression $x^3 + x^2 + x - 4$ to find:\n   $$\n   2^3 + 2^2 + 2 - 4 = 8 + 4 + 2 - 4 = 10\n   $$\n   This not only shows the application of the substitution property but also helps in understanding how to evaluate expressions.\n\n4. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Detailed examples encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By presenting a variety of problems, learners can practice identifying which property to apply in different situations, thus enhancing their analytical abilities.\n\n5. **Understanding Complex Scenarios**: Some equations may have infinite or no solutions. Detailed examples can illustrate these cases, helping learners understand when an equation is inconsistent or dependent. For instance, the equation $2x + 3 = 2x + 5$ leads to no solution, as simplifying gives $3 = 5$, which is a contradiction.\n\nIn conclusion, detailed examples are essential for deepening the understanding of the properties of equality. They provide practical applications, reinforce learning, and develop problem-solving skills, making abstract mathematical concepts more accessible and relatable.
