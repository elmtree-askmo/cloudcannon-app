answer: >-
    Reflections preserve congruence between figures through the properties of isometric transformations. When a figure is reflected across a line, known as the line of reflection, the resulting image is a mirror image of the original figure. This transformation maintains several key characteristics that ensure congruence:\n\n1. **Same Size and Shape**: The reflected image (also called the image) and the original figure (the pre-image) are of the same size and shape. This means that all corresponding sides and angles are equal, which is a fundamental property of congruent figures.\n\n2. **Distance Preservation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, which means that the distance between any two points in the original figure is preserved in the reflected image. For example, if the distance between two points in the pre-image is $d$, the distance between their corresponding points in the image will also be $d$.\n\n3. **Orientation Change**: While reflections preserve size and shape, they do alter the orientation of the figure. The image is laterally inverted, meaning that the left and right sides are switched. However, this change in orientation does not affect the congruence of the figures.\n\n4. **Line of Reflection**: The line of reflection acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$. Each point on the original figure is mapped to a corresponding point on the image such that the line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the original point and its image.\n\nIn summary, reflections maintain congruence by ensuring that the size, shape, and distances between points are preserved, while only the orientation is altered. This is why reflected figures are considered congruent to their original counterparts.
