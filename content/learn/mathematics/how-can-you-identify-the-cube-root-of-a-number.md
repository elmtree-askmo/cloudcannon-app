    How can you identify the cube root of a number?
answer: >-
    To identify the cube root of a number, you can use the notation $\sqrt[3]{x}$ or the exponential form $x^{1/3}$. The cube root of a number $x$ is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals $x$. \n\nFor example, to find the cube root of 64:\n\n1. **Identify the number**: Here, $x = 64$.\n2. **Determine the cube root**: You need to find a number $y$ such that $y \cdot y \cdot y = 64$. In this case, $4$ is the cube root because $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$.\n3. **Express it in radical form**: This can be written as $\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ or in exponential form as $64^{1/3} = 4$.\n\nIn the context of fractional exponents, if you have an expression like $64^{2/3}$, you would first find the cube root of 64 (which is 4) and then square that result, leading to $4^2 = 16$.\n\nThe cube root function is defined for all real numbers, and its graph resembles that of the square root function but is steeper and has a sharper curve. The function can be expressed as $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$, and it has the following properties:\n\n- **Domain**: All real numbers.\n- **Range**: All real numbers.\n- **Intercepts**: The function has one x-intercept and one y-intercept at the origin $(0, 0)$.\n- **Behavior at extremes**: As $x$ approaches positive infinity, $f(x)$ approaches positive infinity, and as $x$ approaches negative infinity, $f(x)$ approaches negative infinity.\n\nIn summary, to identify the cube root of a number, you can either use the radical notation or the exponential form, and you can verify your result by multiplying the cube root by itself three times to see if it equals the original number.
