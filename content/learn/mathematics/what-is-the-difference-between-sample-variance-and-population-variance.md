    What is the difference between sample variance and population variance?
answer: >-
    The difference between sample variance and population variance primarily lies in the formulas used for their calculation and the context in which they are applied.\n\n1. **Sample Variance ($s^2$)**:\n   - Sample variance is calculated when you have a subset (sample) of the entire population. It is used to estimate the variance of the population from which the sample is drawn.\n   - The formula for sample variance is:\n   $$\n   s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2\n   $$\n   where:\n   - $n$ is the number of observations in the sample,\n   - $x_i$ represents each individual observation,\n   - $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.\n   - The denominator is $n-1$ (degrees of freedom) to correct for bias in the estimation of the population variance.\n\n2. **Population Variance ($\sigma^2$)**:\n   - Population variance is calculated when you have data for the entire population. It provides an exact measure of variance without the need for estimation.\n   - The formula for population variance is:\n   $$\n   \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2\n   $$\n   where:\n   - $N$ is the total number of observations in the population,\n   - $x_i$ represents each individual observation,\n   - $\mu$ is the population mean.\n   - The denominator is $N$, as there is no need for a correction factor since the entire population is considered.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Context**: Use sample variance when working with a sample; use population variance when working with the entire population.\n- **Formulas**: The sample variance uses $n-1$ in the denominator, while the population variance uses $N$.\n- **Purpose**: Sample variance estimates the population variance, while population variance provides the actual variance of the population.\n\nIn summary, the choice between sample and population variance depends on whether you are analyzing a sample or the entire population, and this choice affects the calculation method used.
