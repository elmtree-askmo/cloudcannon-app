    What are the defining characteristics of a rectangle?
answer: >-
    A rectangle is a specific type of quadrilateral, which is a four-sided polygon. The defining characteristics of a rectangle include:\n\n1. **Opposite Sides**: A rectangle has two pairs of opposite sides that are equal in length. This means that if one side measures a certain length, the side directly opposite it will measure the same length.\n\n2. **Right Angles**: All four interior angles of a rectangle are right angles, each measuring 90 degrees. This property is crucial in distinguishing rectangles from other quadrilaterals.\n\n3. **Diagonals**: The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other. This means that if you draw a line connecting opposite corners, those lines will be of equal length and will intersect at their midpoints.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**: The area $A$ of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\n   $$\n   where the length is the longer side and the width (or breadth) is the shorter side.\n\n5. **Special Case**: A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are of equal length. Therefore, while all squares are rectangles, not all rectangles are squares.\n\nThese characteristics make rectangles a fundamental shape in geometry, with applications in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and design.
