    What are the specific rules for reflecting a function over the x-axis?
answer: >-
    To reflect a function over the x-axis, you apply the following specific rule:\n\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)\n$$\n\nThis means that for every point on the original function, the y-coordinate is negated while the x-coordinate remains unchanged. The transformation can also be expressed in function notation as:\n\n$$\ny = -f(x)\n$$\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Effect on Coordinates**: The reflection over the x-axis flips the graph upside down. For example, if you have a point \( (x, f(x)) \) on the original graph, the corresponding point on the reflected graph will be \( (x, -f(x)) \).\n\n2. **Example**: Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \). Reflecting this function over the x-axis results in:\n   $$\n   g(x) = -x^2\n   $$\n   The graph of \( g(x) \) will be an upside-down parabola compared to \( f(x) \).\n\n3. **General Application**: This reflection rule applies to all types of functions, including linear, quadratic, and more complex functions. For instance, if you take the cube root function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \), reflecting it over the x-axis gives you:\n   $$\n   g(x) = -\sqrt[3]{x}\n   $$\n\n4. **Reflection Properties**: Understanding these properties is crucial for analyzing function graphs. The reflection over the x-axis does not alter the x-coordinates of points; it solely affects the y-coordinates, which is particularly useful in mathematical modeling and function evaluation.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, reflecting a function over the x-axis involves negating the output values of the function while keeping the input values the same. This transformation is fundamental in understanding how functions behave under various transformations and is essential for graphing and analyzing functions effectively.
