    To calculate the average rate of change for piecewise linear functions using tables, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Interval**: Determine the interval $[a, b]$ over which you want to calculate the average rate of change. This interval will dictate which segments of the piecewise function you will use.\n\n2. **Locate Function Values**: Use a table to find the function values at the endpoints of the interval. If the interval crosses over different segments of the piecewise function, you will need to find the corresponding function values for each segment.\n\n3. **Apply the Average Rate of Change Formula**: The average rate of change is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n   $$\n   Here, \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) are the function values at the endpoints of the interval.\n\n4. **Interpret the Result**: The result will indicate how much the function's value changes per unit change in the input over the specified interval. A positive result indicates an increase, while a negative result indicates a decrease.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a piecewise function defined as follows:\n$$\nf(x) = \begin{cases} \n2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\\n-x + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSuppose you want to calculate the average rate of change from $x = -2$ to $x = 2$.\n\n1. **Identify the Interval**: The interval is $[-2, 2]$.\n\n2. **Locate Function Values**:\n   - For $x = -2$ (which is in the first segment): \n     $$f(-2) = 2(-2) + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3$$\n   - For $x = 2$ (which is in the second segment):\n     $$f(2) = -2 + 3 = 1$$\n\n3. **Apply the Average Rate of Change Formula**:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(2) - f(-2)}{2 - (-2)} = \frac{1 - (-3)}{2 + 2} = \frac{1 + 3}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1\n   $$\n\n4. **Interpret the Result**: The average rate of change is 1, meaning the function increases by 1 unit for every 1 unit increase in $x$ over the interval from $-2$ to $2$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively calculate the average rate of change for piecewise linear functions using tables.
