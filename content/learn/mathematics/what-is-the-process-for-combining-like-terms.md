    What is the process for combining like terms?
answer: >-
    The process for combining like terms in algebra is a fundamental skill that simplifies expressions and makes solving equations more manageable. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to combine like terms:\n\n1. **Identify Like Terms**: Like terms are terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same power(s). For example, in the expression $4x + 3 + 7y$, the like terms are $4x$ and $7y$ since they have different variables, while $3$ is a constant term.\n\n2. **Group Like Terms**: Once you have identified the like terms, group them together. For instance, in the expression $3x + 7x - 2x$, the like terms are $3x$, $7x$, and $-2x$.\n\n3. **Add or Subtract Coefficients**: Combine the coefficients of the like terms by adding or subtracting them. In our example, you would calculate:\n   $$ \n   3 + 7 - 2 = 8 \n   $$\n   Therefore, $3x + 7x - 2x$ simplifies to $8x$.\n\n4. **Rewrite the Expression**: After combining the like terms, rewrite the expression with the simplified terms. For example, if you started with $3x + 7x - 2x + 5$, after combining like terms, it would become $8x + 5$.\n\n5. **Check for Further Simplification**: Sometimes, after combining like terms, you may need to check if the expression can be simplified further using other algebraic techniques, such as the distributive property or factoring.\n\nBy practicing problems involving combining like terms, students can improve their skills in simplifying algebraic expressions, making it easier to solve equations and understand more complex algebraic concepts.
