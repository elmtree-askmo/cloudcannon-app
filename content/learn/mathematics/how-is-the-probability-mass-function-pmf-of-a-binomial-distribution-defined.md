    How is the probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution defined?
answer: >-
    The probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is defined as the probability of obtaining exactly $ k $ successes in $ n $ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: success (with probability $ p $) and failure (with probability $ q = 1 - p $). The PMF can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nP(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( P(X = k) \) is the probability of getting exactly $ k $ successes,\n- $ n $ is the total number of trials,\n- $ k $ is the number of successes (where $ k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n $),\n- $ p $ is the probability of success on an individual trial,\n- $ \binom{n}{k} $ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \( \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).\n\nThis formula allows us to calculate the likelihood of achieving a specific number of successes in a series of independent trials, making it a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics.
