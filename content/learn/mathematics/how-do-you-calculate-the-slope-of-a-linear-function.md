    How do you calculate the slope of a linear function?
answer: >-
    To calculate the slope of a linear function, you can use the formula for slope, which is defined as the change in the dependent variable (usually $y$) divided by the change in the independent variable (usually $x$). This is often referred to as "rise over run." The formula for calculating the slope $m$ between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on the line is given by:\n\n$$\nm = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\n### Steps to Calculate the Slope:\n\n1. **Identify Two Points**: Choose two points on the line, which can be represented as \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).\n\n2. **Substitute the Values**: Plug the coordinates of these points into the slope formula.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Compute the difference in the $y$-coordinates (rise) and the difference in the $x$-coordinates (run).\n\n4. **Divide**: Divide the difference in $y$ by the difference in $x$ to find the slope.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf you have two points, say \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 4)\):\n\n1. $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = 2$\n2. $x_2 = 3$, $y_2 = 4$\n\nUsing the slope formula:\n\n$$\nm = \frac{4 - 2}{3 - 1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\n$$\n\nThus, the slope of the linear function is $1$, indicating that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by $1$.\n\n### Characteristics of Slope:\n\n- A **positive slope** indicates that the function is increasing.\n- A **negative slope** indicates that the function is decreasing.\n- A **slope of zero** indicates a horizontal line, while an **undefined slope** indicates a vertical line.\n\nUnderstanding how to calculate and interpret the slope is crucial for analyzing linear functions and their graphical representations.
