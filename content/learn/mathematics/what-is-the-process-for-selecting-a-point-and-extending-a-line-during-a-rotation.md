    What is the process for selecting a point and extending a line during a rotation?
answer: >-
    The process for selecting a point and extending a line during a rotation involves several steps that ensure the line is rotated accurately around a specified pivot point. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Select the Center of Rotation**: First, you need to choose the point around which the rotation will occur. This point is often referred to as the center of rotation. It can be any point in the coordinate system, such as the origin or any other specified point.\n\n2. **Select the Line to Rotate**: Identify the line segment that you want to rotate. This line can be defined by its endpoints, and you will need to know its orientation and length.\n\n3. **Determine the Angle of Rotation**: Decide the angle by which you want to rotate the line. This angle can be specified in degrees and can be either clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, a positive angle typically indicates a counterclockwise rotation, while a negative angle indicates a clockwise rotation.\n\n4. **Draw a Reference Line**: To visualize the rotation, you can draw an imaginary reference line from the center of rotation to one endpoint of the line segment. This reference line will help you understand how the line will move during the rotation.\n\n5. **Extend the Line**: If you need to extend the line, you can do so by drawing a line starting from one endpoint and extending it in the direction of the line. This can be done using a straightedge or ruler.\n\n6. **Construct the Perpendicular Line**: At the endpoint of the line segment, construct a perpendicular line. This line will help establish the right angle needed for the rotation.\n\n7. **Use a Compass for Arc Path**: Place the compass point at the center of rotation, measure the distance to the endpoint of the line, and draw an arc. This arc will represent the path that the endpoint will take during the rotation.\n\n8. **Locate the New Endpoint**: The intersection of the arc with the perpendicular line will give you the new location of the endpoint after rotation. This point is the result of rotating the original endpoint by the specified angle around the center of rotation.\n\n9. **Draw the Rotated Line**: Finally, connect the center of rotation to the new endpoint to complete the rotated line segment.\n\nThis process allows for precise control over the rotation of lines and shapes in a two-dimensional space, ensuring that the orientation and position are maintained according to the specified parameters. \n\nIn summary, the key steps involve selecting the center of rotation, determining the angle, extending the line, and using geometric constructions to find the new position of the line after rotation.
