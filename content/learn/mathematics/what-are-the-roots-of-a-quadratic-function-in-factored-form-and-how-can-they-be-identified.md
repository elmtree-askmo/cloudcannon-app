    What are the roots of a quadratic function in factored form, and how can they be identified?
answer: >-
    The roots of a quadratic function in factored form can be identified using the expression:\n\n$$\nf(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ are the roots (or zeros) of the quadratic function, and $ a $ is a coefficient that affects the vertical stretch or compression of the graph. The roots represent the x-values where the function equals zero, meaning:\n\n$$\nf(r_1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(r_2) = 0\n$$\n\nTo find the roots from a quadratic function, you can use several methods:\n\n1. **Factoring**: If the quadratic can be factored easily, you can express it in the form \( f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \) and directly identify the roots as $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $. For example, for the quadratic \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 \), it can be factored as \( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \), yielding roots at $ x = 2 $ and $ x = 3 $.\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula**: If factoring is not straightforward, you can use the quadratic formula to find the roots. The formula is given by:\n\n$$\nx = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n\nHere, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are the coefficients from the standard form of the quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $. The term $ b^2 - 4ac $ is known as the discriminant, which helps determine the nature of the roots:\n- If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.\n- If it is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n- If it is negative, the roots are complex.\n\n3. **Graphing**: You can also graph the quadratic function and identify the x-intercepts, which correspond to the roots of the function.\n\nIn summary, the roots of a quadratic function can be identified through factoring, using the quadratic formula, or graphing, and they provide critical information about the function's behavior, including where it intersects the x-axis and changes sign.
