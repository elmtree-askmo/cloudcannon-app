    How do you determine the truth value of an equation?
answer: >-
    To determine the truth value of an equation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Equation**: Start with the equation you want to evaluate. For example, consider the equation $x - 1 = 9$.\n\n2. **Solve for the Variable**: Rearrange the equation to isolate the variable. In our example, you would add 1 to both sides to get $x = 10$. This means that the equation is true when $x$ is equal to 10.\n\n3. **Test Values**: Substitute different values into the equation to see if it holds true. For instance:\n   - If $x = 10$, then $10 - 1 = 9$ is true.\n   - If $x = 5$, then $5 - 1 = 9$ is false, as $4 \neq 9$.\n\n4. **Determine the Truth Value**: Based on the testing, you can conclude that the equation $x - 1 = 9$ is true only when $x = 10$. For all other values of $x$, the equation is false. This type of equation is referred to as a conditional equation because it is true only under specific conditions.\n\n5. **Use Truth Tables for Complex Statements**: For more complex logical statements or equations involving multiple variables, you can create a truth table. A truth table systematically lists all possible combinations of truth values for the variables involved and shows the resulting truth value of the entire statement. For example, for a statement like \(A \land \neg(B \lor C)\), you would list all combinations of truth values for $A$, $B$, and $C$ and evaluate the expression for each combination.\n\n6. **Practice with Inequalities**: Similar to equations, you can also determine the truth value of inequalities by testing values. For example, for the inequality $x > 5$, you can test values like $x = 6$ (true) and $x = 4$ (false) to determine where the inequality holds.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the truth value of various mathematical statements, equations, and inequalities.
