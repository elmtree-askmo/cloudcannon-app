    How is the theorem for r-permutations with repetition derived?
answer: >-
    The theorem for $ r $-permutations with repetition is derived based on the principle of counting choices for each position in the permutation. Specifically, when forming an $ r $-permutation from a set of $ n $ objects where repetition is allowed, we can select any of the $ n $ objects for each of the $ r $ positions in the permutation.\n\nThe derivation can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Choices for Each Position**: For the first position in the permutation, there are $ n $ possible choices (since we can choose any of the $ n $ objects). The same applies for the second position, the third position, and so on, up to the $ r $-th position.\n\n2. **Independent Choices**: The choices for each position are independent of each other. This means that the choice made for one position does not affect the choices available for the other positions.\n\n3. **Total Count Using the Product Rule**: By the product rule of counting, the total number of $ r $-permutations with repetition allowed is the product of the number of choices for each position. Therefore, the total number of $ r $-permutations is given by:\n   $$\n   n \times n \times n \times \ldots \text{ (r times)} = n^r\n   $$\n\nThus, the theorem states that the number of $ r $-permutations of a set of $ n $ objects with repetition allowed is $ n^r $.\n\nIn summary, the formula for $ r $-permutations with repetition is:\n$$\nP(n, r) = n^r\n$$\n\nThis theorem is fundamental in combinatorics and has various applications, such as in counting arrangements of items where duplicates are allowed.
