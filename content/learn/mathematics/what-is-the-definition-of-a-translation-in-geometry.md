    What is the definition of a translation in geometry?
answer: >-
    In geometry, a translation is defined as a type of geometric transformation that moves or slides a figure from one position to another without altering its size, shape, or orientation. This means that every point of the figure is moved the same distance in the same direction. \n\nFor example, if you have a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C, and you translate it by a vector (x, y), the new positions of the vertices will be A', B', and C', where:\n\n- A' = A + (x, y)\n- B' = B + (x, y)\n- C' = C + (x, y)\n\nThis transformation preserves the congruence of the figure, meaning the original triangle and the translated triangle are identical in shape and size, just located in different positions on the coordinate plane.\n\nTranslations can be represented algebraically using vectors, and they are a fundamental concept in understanding rigid motions in geometry, which include translations, rotations, and reflections.
