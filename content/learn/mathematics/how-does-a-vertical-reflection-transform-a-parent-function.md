    How does a vertical reflection transform a parent function?
answer: >-
    A vertical reflection transforms a parent function by flipping its graph over the x-axis. This transformation is represented mathematically as follows:\n\nIf the original function is given by \( y = f(x) \), the vertical reflection of this function is expressed as \( y = -f(x) \). In this transformation, the x-values of the function remain unchanged, while the y-values become their opposites. This means that for every point \( (x, y) \) on the original graph, there is a corresponding point \( (x, -y) \) on the reflected graph.\n\n### Example:\nConsider the parent function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The vertical reflection of this function would be:\n\n- Original function: \( y = f(x) = x^2 \)\n- Reflected function: \( y = -f(x) = -x^2 \)\n\nIn this case, the graph of $ y = x^2 $ is a parabola that opens upwards, while the graph of $ y = -x^2 $ is a parabola that opens downwards. The y-values of the reflected function are the negatives of the original function's y-values.\n\n### Reflection Properties:\n1. **X-values remain the same**: The x-coordinates of points on the graph do not change.\n2. **Y-values become opposite**: The y-coordinates are negated, resulting in a vertical flip of the graph.\n\n### Steps to Identify a Vertical Reflection:\n1. Create a table of values for the original function \( y = f(x) \).\n2. Calculate the corresponding y-values for the reflected function \( y = -f(x) \).\n3. Compare the outputs to observe that the y-values are opposites.\n4. Graph both functions to visually confirm the reflection over the x-axis.\n\nThis transformation is crucial in understanding how functions behave under various transformations and is a fundamental concept in graphing functions and mathematical modeling.
