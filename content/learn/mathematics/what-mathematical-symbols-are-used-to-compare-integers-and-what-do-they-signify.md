    What mathematical symbols are used to compare integers and what do they signify?
answer: >-
    In mathematics, several symbols are used to compare integers, each signifying a specific relationship between the values. The primary symbols for comparing integers are:\n\n1. **Greater Than (>)**: This symbol indicates that the integer on the left is larger than the integer on the right. For example, if we write $5 > 3$, it means that 5 is greater than 3.\n\n2. **Less Than (<)**: This symbol signifies that the integer on the left is smaller than the integer on the right. For instance, $2 < 4$ means that 2 is less than 4.\n\n3. **Equal To (=)**: This symbol denotes that both integers are the same. For example, $7 = 7$ indicates that both sides are equal.\n\n4. **Greater Than or Equal To (≥)**: This symbol indicates that the integer on the left is either greater than or equal to the integer on the right. For example, $6 ≥ 6$ means that 6 is equal to 6, and $7 ≥ 5$ means that 7 is greater than 5.\n\n5. **Less Than or Equal To (≤)**: This symbol signifies that the integer on the left is either less than or equal to the integer on the right. For example, $3 ≤ 5$ means that 3 is less than 5, and $4 ≤ 4$ means that 4 is equal to 4.\n\nThese symbols are essential for ordering integers and understanding their relationships on a number line, where numbers to the right are larger than those to the left. For example, if we compare -4 and 3, we can see that -4 < 3, as -4 is located to the left of 3 on the number line. \n\nUnderstanding these symbols is crucial for solving inequalities and performing various mathematical operations involving integers.
