    How is horizontal symmetry different from vertical symmetry in reflections?
answer: >-
    Horizontal symmetry and vertical symmetry are two types of reflection symmetry that relate to how a geometric figure can be divided into two identical halves.\n\n1. **Vertical Symmetry**: A shape exhibits vertical symmetry if it can be divided by a vertical line (line of symmetry) such that the left side of the shape is a mirror image of the right side. For example, the letter "A" has vertical symmetry because if you draw a vertical line down the center, both halves are identical.\n\n2. **Horizontal Symmetry**: Conversely, a shape has horizontal symmetry if it can be divided by a horizontal line such that the top half of the shape is a mirror image of the bottom half. For instance, the letter "H" has horizontal symmetry because a horizontal line drawn through its center will show that both the upper and lower halves are identical.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Orientation of the Line of Symmetry**: The primary difference lies in the orientation of the line of symmetry. Vertical symmetry uses a vertical line, while horizontal symmetry uses a horizontal line.\n- **Reflection Across the Line**: In vertical symmetry, the reflection occurs across a vertical axis, affecting the left and right sides of the figure. In horizontal symmetry, the reflection occurs across a horizontal axis, affecting the top and bottom parts of the figure.\n\n### Examples:\n- **Vertical Symmetry**: Letters like "B", "C", "D", and "E" also exhibit vertical symmetry.\n- **Horizontal Symmetry**: Letters like "I", "O", and "X" exhibit horizontal symmetry as well.\n\nIn summary, while both types of symmetry involve reflection, they differ in the orientation of the line of symmetry and the parts of the figure that are mirrored.
