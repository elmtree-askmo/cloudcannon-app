    How do you translate a line on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To translate a line on the coordinate plane, you need to understand the concept of translation as a rigid transformation. Translation involves shifting every point of the line a certain distance in a specified direction without altering its shape or orientation.\n\n### Steps to Translate a Line:\n\n1. **Identify the Line's Equation**: Start with the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, which is typically written as $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Determine the Translation Vector**: A translation can be defined by a vector \((a, b)\), where:\n   - $a$ is the horizontal shift (positive for right, negative for left).\n   - $b$ is the vertical shift (positive for up, negative for down).\n\n3. **Apply the Translation**: To translate the line, you will adjust the coordinates of every point on the line according to the translation vector. If you have a point \((x, y)\) on the original line, the new point \((x', y')\) after translation will be:\n   - $x' = x + a$\n   - $y' = y + b$\n\n4. **Write the New Equation**: After translating, you can find the new equation of the line. If the original line is given by $y = mx + b$, the new line after translation will be:\n   - \(y = mx + (b + b)\) for vertical translation.\n   - For horizontal translation, you can substitute $x$ with $x - a$ in the original equation, leading to:\n   - \(y = m(x - a) + b\).\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose you have a line given by the equation $y = 2x + 3$ and you want to translate it 4 units to the right and 2 units up.\n\n1. **Original Line**: $y = 2x + 3$\n2. **Translation Vector**: \((4, 2)\)\n3. **New Points**: For a point \((x, y)\) on the line, the new point will be:\n   - $x' = x + 4$\n   - $y' = y + 2$\n4. **New Equation**: \n   - Substitute $x$ with $x - 4$ in the original equation:\n   - \(y = 2(x - 4) + 3\)\n   - Simplifying gives $y = 2x - 8 + 3$ or $y = 2x - 5$.\n\nThus, the new equation of the line after translation is $y = 2x - 5$.\n\n### Visualization:\n\nYou can visualize this transformation using graphing tools or software like GeoGebra, which allows you to see the original line and its translated version on the coordinate plane.\n\nIn summary, translating a line involves shifting its points according to a defined vector and updating its equation accordingly. This process maintains the line's slope and orientation while changing its position in the coordinate plane.
