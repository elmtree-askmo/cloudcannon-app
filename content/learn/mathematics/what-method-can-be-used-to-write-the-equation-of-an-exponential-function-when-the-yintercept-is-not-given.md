    What method can be used to write the equation of an exponential function when the y-intercept is not given?
answer: >-
    To write the equation of an exponential function when the y-intercept is not given, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Two Points on the Curve**: Choose two points from the graph of the exponential function. If possible, select points that are easy to work with, such as those with integer coordinates.\n\n2. **Use the General Form**: The general form of an exponential function is given by:\n   $$ \n   y = a \cdot b^x \n   $$\n   where $ a $ is the initial value (y-intercept) and $ b $ is the base of the exponential function.\n\n3. **Set Up a System of Equations**: Substitute the coordinates of the two points into the general form to create a system of equations. For example, if you have points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), you will have:\n   - $ y_1 = a \cdot b^{x_1} $\n   - $ y_2 = a \cdot b^{x_2} $\n\n4. **Solve for $ a $ and $ b $**:\n   - From the first equation, you can express $ a $ in terms of $ b $:\n     $$\n     a = \frac{y_1}{b^{x_1}}\n     $$\n   - Substitute this expression for $ a $ into the second equation:\n     $$\n     y_2 = \frac{y_1}{b^{x_1}} \cdot b^{x_2}\n     $$\n   - Rearranging gives you an equation in terms of $ b $:\n     $$\n     b^{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_2}{y_1}\n     $$\n   - Solve for $ b $:\n     $$\n     b = \left(\frac{y_2}{y_1}\right)^{\frac{1}{x_2 - x_1}}\n     $$\n\n5. **Substitute Back to Find $ a $**: Once you have $ b $, substitute it back into the equation for $ a $ to find its value.\n\n6. **Write the Final Equation**: With both $ a $ and $ b $ determined, you can write the complete equation of the exponential function.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have the points (1, 3) and (2, 4.5):\n- From the first point: \n  $$ \n  3 = a \cdot b^1 \n  $$\n- From the second point:\n  $$ \n  4.5 = a \cdot b^2 \n  $$\n\nUsing the steps outlined, you can solve for $ a $ and $ b $ to find the equation of the exponential function.\n\nThis method allows you to derive the equation of an exponential function even when the y-intercept is not directly provided.
