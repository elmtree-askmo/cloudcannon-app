answer: >-
    The first step in the unit conversion process is to **identify the units used**. This involves recognizing both the initial unit from which you are converting and the target unit to which you want to convert. Understanding the units involved is crucial as it sets the foundation for the subsequent steps in the conversion process.\n\nOnce you have identified the units, the next steps typically involve determining the relationship between these units and establishing the appropriate conversion factor. This systematic approach ensures accuracy in the conversion process.
