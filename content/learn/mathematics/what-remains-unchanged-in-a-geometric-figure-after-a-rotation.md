    What remains unchanged in a geometric figure after a rotation?
answer: >-
    After a rotation, several aspects of a geometric figure remain unchanged:\n\n1. **Shape**: The overall shape of the figure does not change. For example, if you rotate a triangle, it will still be a triangle after the rotation.\n\n2. **Size**: The dimensions of the figure remain constant. A rotation does not alter the lengths of the sides or the angles of the figure.\n\n3. **Distance between Points**: The distances between any two points in the figure remain the same. This means that if you measure the distance between two vertices of a triangle before and after rotation, that distance will be unchanged.\n\n4. **Area**: The area of the figure remains constant. Rotating a figure does not affect how much space it occupies.\n\n5. **Orientation**: While the orientation of the figure may change (for example, it may face a different direction), the relative positions of the points within the figure remain consistent with respect to each other.\n\n6. **Symmetry**: If a figure has rotational symmetry, it will look the same after certain rotations (like 180 degrees). This means that the figure can be rotated around a point and still appear unchanged.\n\nIn summary, while the position and orientation of a geometric figure may change after a rotation, its shape, size, distances between points, area, and certain symmetries remain unchanged.
