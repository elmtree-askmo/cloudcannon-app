    How do definite integrals relate to the concept of accumulated change?
answer: >-
    Definite integrals are fundamentally linked to the concept of accumulated change, serving as a powerful tool in calculus to quantify how a quantity changes over a specified interval. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of this relationship:\n\n1. **Definition of Definite Integral**: A definite integral is defined as the limit of a sum of small changes in a function over an interval \((a, b)\). Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n   $$\n   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n   This integral calculates the total accumulated change of the function \(f(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\).\n\n2. **Accumulated Change**: The definite integral represents the total accumulated change of a quantity over the interval. If \(f(x)\) is interpreted as a rate of change (for example, velocity), then the definite integral of \(f(x)\) from \(a\) to \(b\) gives the total change in the quantity (such as distance) over that interval. This is often referred to as the Net Change Theorem, which states that the accumulated rate of change can be measured by the area under the graph of the function.\n\n3. **Signed Area**: The definite integral also represents the signed area between the graph of the function and the x-axis. Areas above the x-axis contribute positively to the accumulated change, while areas below the x-axis contribute negatively. This is crucial for accurately interpreting the total change, as it reflects both increases and decreases in the quantity being measured.\n\n4. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The relationship between definite integrals and accumulated change is formalized in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This theorem states that if \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\), then:\n   $$\n   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n   $$\n   This means that the definite integral can be evaluated by finding the difference in the values of the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval, reinforcing the idea that the integral measures the total change in the function over that interval.\n\n5. **Real-World Applications**: In practical terms, definite integrals are used to solve various real-world problems. For instance, if \(f(t)\) represents the speed of a car over time, then the definite integral of \(f(t)\) from time \(t_1\) to \(t_2\) gives the total distance traveled by the car during that time period.\n\nIn summary, definite integrals provide a mathematical framework for quantifying accumulated change by calculating the total area under a curve, taking into account both positive and negative contributions, and linking this to real-world scenarios through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
