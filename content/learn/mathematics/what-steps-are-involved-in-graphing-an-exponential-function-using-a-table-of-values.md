    What steps are involved in graphing an exponential function using a table of values?
answer: >-
    To graph an exponential function using a table of values, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose the Function**: Start with the exponential function you want to graph, typically in the form $ y = a \cdot b^x $, where $ a $ is the initial value and $ b $ is the base of the exponential.\n\n2. **Create a Table of Values**:\n   - Select a range of $ x $-values. It's common to choose both negative and positive values to see the behavior of the function across the entire range.\n   - Substitute each $ x $-value into the function to calculate the corresponding $ y $-values. For example, if you are graphing $ y = 2^x $, you might choose $ x $ values like -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and calculate:\n     - \( y(-2) = 2^{-2} = 0.25 \)\n     - \( y(-1) = 2^{-1} = 0.5 \)\n     - \( y(0) = 2^0 = 1 \)\n     - \( y(1) = 2^1 = 2 \)\n     - \( y(2) = 2^2 = 4 \)\n\n3. **Plot the Points**: Using the table of values, plot the points on a coordinate graph. Each point corresponds to an \( (x, y) \) coordinate.\n\n4. **Connect the Points**: After plotting the points, connect them with a smooth curve. Exponential functions typically exhibit a rapid increase or decrease, so the curve should reflect this behavior.\n\n5. **Identify Asymptotes**: Exponential functions often have horizontal asymptotes. For example, the function $ y = 2^x $ approaches the line $ y = 0 $ as $ x $ approaches negative infinity. Make sure to indicate this on your graph.\n\n6. **Label the Graph**: Finally, label the axes and the function to provide clarity.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph an exponential function and visualize its characteristics, such as growth or decay and the presence of asymptotes.
