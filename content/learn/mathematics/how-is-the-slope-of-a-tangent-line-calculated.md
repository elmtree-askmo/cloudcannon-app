answer: >-
    The slope of a tangent line to a curve at a specific point can be calculated using the derivative of the function that defines the curve. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Let the curve be defined by the function \( y = f(x) \).\n\n2. **Calculate the Derivative**: The first step is to find the derivative of the function, denoted as \( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{dy}{dx} \). This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point \( x \) on the curve.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Derivative at the Point of Interest**: To find the slope of the tangent line at a specific point \( (x_0, y_0) \), substitute \( x_0 \) into the derivative:\n   $$\n   m = f'(x_0)\n   $$\n   Here, \( m \) is the slope of the tangent line at the point \( (x_0, y_0) \).\n\n4. **Use the Point-Slope Form to Write the Equation of the Tangent Line**: Once you have the slope \( m \), you can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to write the equation of the tangent line:\n   $$\n   y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\n   $$\n\n### Example\nFor instance, to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve \( f(x) = x^2 \) at the point \( (1, 2) \):\n\n1. **Calculate the Derivative**:\n   \[\n   f'(x) = 2x\n   \]\n\n2. **Evaluate the Derivative at \( x = 1 \)**:\n   \[\n   m = f'(1) = 2(1) = 2\n   \]\n\n3. **Write the Equation of the Tangent Line**:\n   Using the point-slope form:\n   \[\n   y - 2 = 2(x - 1)\n   \]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \[\n   y = 2x\n   \]\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent line at the point \( (1, 2) \) is 2, and the equation of the tangent line is \( y = 2x \).\n\nThis method can be applied to any differentiable function to find the slope of the tangent line at any given point.
