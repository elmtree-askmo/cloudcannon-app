    The rank of a matrix is defined as the dimension of the vector space generated by its rows or columns, indicating the maximum number of linearly independent vectors. It is determined through row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, with implications for linear systems and invertibility.

    What is the definition of the rank of a matrix?
answer: >-
    The rank of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, defined as the dimension of the vector space generated by its rows (row rank) or columns (column rank). In simpler terms, the rank indicates the maximum number of linearly independent row or column vectors in the matrix.\n\n### Determining the Rank of a Matrix\n\nTo determine the rank of a matrix, one common method is to transform the matrix into its row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF) using elementary row operations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of the process:\n\n1. **Form the Matrix**: Start with the matrix for which you want to find the rank.\n\n2. **Row Reduction**: Use elementary row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, and adding or subtracting rows) to transform the matrix into its row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\n3. **Count the Non-Zero Rows**: Once in REF or RREF, the rank of the matrix is equal to the number of non-zero rows present in this form. Each non-zero row corresponds to a linearly independent vector.\n\n### Significance of the Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix has several important implications, particularly in the context of systems of linear equations, vector spaces, and matrix invertibility. For example, a square matrix $ A $ is invertible if and only if its rank is equal to its dimension $ n $. This means that for an $ n \times n $ matrix, if \( \text{rank}(A) = n \), then $ A $ is non-singular and has an inverse.\n\nIn summary, the rank of a matrix provides critical information about the linear independence of its rows and columns, the solutions to associated linear systems, and the matrix's invertibility.
