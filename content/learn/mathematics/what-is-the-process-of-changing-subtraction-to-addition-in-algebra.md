    What is the process of changing subtraction to addition in algebra?
answer: >-
    In algebra, changing subtraction to addition is a useful technique that simplifies expressions and calculations. The process can be summarized using the phrase "Keep - Change - Change." Hereâ€™s how it works:\n\n1. **Keep the first number**: Leave the first term of the expression unchanged.\n2. **Change the subtraction sign to an addition sign**: Replace the subtraction sign with an addition sign.\n3. **Change the sign of the last number**: If the last number is positive, change it to negative, and if it is negative, change it to positive.\n\nFor example, if you have the expression $ a - b $, you can rewrite it as:\n$$\na - b = a + (-b)\n$$\n\nThis method is particularly helpful when dealing with complex expressions, as it allows you to handle subtraction more easily by converting it into addition of the opposite.\n\nAdditionally, this technique is rooted in the concept of the additive inverse, where subtracting a number is equivalent to adding its negative. This principle is essential in algebra, as it maintains the equality of expressions while simplifying calculations.\n\nIn practice, when you encounter a subtraction operation in an algebraic expression, applying the "Keep - Change - Change" method can streamline your work and help you combine like terms more effectively.
