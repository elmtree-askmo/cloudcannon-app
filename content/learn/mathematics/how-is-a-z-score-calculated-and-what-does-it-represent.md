    How is a z score calculated and what does it represent?
answer: >-
    A z-score is a statistical measure that indicates how many standard deviations a particular data point is from the mean of a dataset. It is calculated using the following formulas:\n\n- For a population:\n$$\nz = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $ x $ is the value of the data point,\n- $ \mu $ is the mean of the population,\n- $ \sigma $ is the standard deviation of the population.\n\n- For a sample:\n$$\nz = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $ \bar{x} $ is the mean of the sample,\n- $ s $ is the standard deviation of the sample.\n\nThe z-score provides insight into the relative standing of a value within a dataset. A positive z-score indicates that the value is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates that it is below the mean. For example, if a student's test score is 85, the class mean is 75, and the standard deviation is 10, the z-score would be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nz = \frac{85 - 75}{10} = 1\n$$\n\nThis means that the student's score is 1 standard deviation above the mean of the class.\n\nIn summary, the z-score is a useful tool in statistics for understanding how a specific data point compares to the overall distribution of data, allowing for the identification of outliers and the assessment of relative performance within a dataset.
