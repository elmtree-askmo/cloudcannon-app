    To find the possible values for a discrete random variable, let's go through a step-by-step example using the scenario of rolling a fair six-sided die. \n\n### Step 1: Define the Random Variable\nLet $X$ be the random variable that represents the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die. \n\n### Step 2: Identify the Possible Outcomes\nWhen rolling a six-sided die, the possible outcomes are the numbers that can appear on the die. These outcomes are:\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n- 6\n\n### Step 3: List the Possible Values\nThe set of possible values for the random variable $X$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nD = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Assign Probabilities\nSince the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of occurring. The probability mass function (p.m.f.) for $X$ can be defined as:\n$$\nP(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} \quad \text{for } x \in D\n$$\nThis means that the probability of rolling any specific number (1 through 6) is $ \frac{1}{6} $.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Total Probability\nTo ensure that the probabilities are valid, we can check that the sum of the probabilities equals 1:\n$$\nP(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) = 6 \times \frac{1}{6} = 1\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe possible values of the discrete random variable $X$ when rolling a fair six-sided die are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, each with a probability of $ \frac{1}{6} $. This example illustrates how to identify and list the possible values of a discrete random variable, as well as how to assign probabilities to those values.
