    What are the fundamental trigonometric identities?
answer: >-
    The fundamental trigonometric identities are essential relationships involving the six primary trigonometric functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), cosecant (csc), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot). These identities can be categorized into several types:\n\n1. **Reciprocal Identities**:\n   - $ \sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta} $\n   - $ \cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta} $\n   - $ \tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta} $\n\n2. **Pythagorean Identities**:\n   - $ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 $\n   - $ 1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta $\n   - $ 1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta $\n\n3. **Quotient Identities**:\n   - $ \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} $\n   - $ \cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} $\n\nThese identities are foundational in trigonometry and are used to simplify expressions, solve equations, and prove other mathematical statements. They can be derived from the definitions of the trigonometric functions based on a right triangle or the unit circle.\n\nIn addition to these fundamental identities, there are also angle-sum and angle-difference identities, double-angle identities, and half-angle identities, which further expand the toolkit for working with trigonometric functions. For example, the angle-sum identity for sine is given by:\n\n$$\n\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b\n$$\n\nUnderstanding and applying these identities is crucial for success in geometry, trigonometry, and various applications in science and engineering.
