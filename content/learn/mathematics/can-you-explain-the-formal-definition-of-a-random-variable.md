answer: >-
    A random variable is formally defined as a measurable function that maps outcomes from a sample space of a random experiment to a measurable space. In the context of probability theory, this is often represented as follows:\n\nLet $\struct {\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr}$ be a probability space, where $\Omega$ is the sample space, $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$, and $\Pr$ is a probability measure. A random variable $X$ is then a function $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space $\Omega$. \n\nThis definition allows us to compute probabilities associated with the random variable, such as $\Pr[X \in S]$, where $S$ is a set of real numbers. The random variable can take on various values depending on the outcome of the random experiment, and it is typically denoted by capital letters such as $X$, $Y$, or $Z$.\n\nIn summary, a random variable serves as a bridge between the abstract outcomes of a random process and the numerical values that can be analyzed statistically.
