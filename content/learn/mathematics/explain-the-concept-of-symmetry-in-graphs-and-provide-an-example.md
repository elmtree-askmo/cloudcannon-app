    Symmetry in graphs is a fundamental concept in mathematics that refers to the property where a graph remains unchanged under specific transformations. This property can greatly simplify the analysis of functions and their graphs.\n\nThere are several types of symmetry commonly observed in graphs:\n\n1. **Symmetry about the y-axis**: A graph is symmetric about the y-axis if for every point \((x, y)\) on the graph, the point \((-x, y)\) is also on the graph. This is characteristic of even functions. A classic example is the quadratic function $y = x^2$. If you reflect the graph of this function across the y-axis, it remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Symmetry about the origin**: A graph is symmetric about the origin if for every point \((x, y)\) on the graph, the point \((-x, -y)\) is also on the graph. This is characteristic of odd functions. An example of this is the cubic function $y = x^3$. Reflecting the graph across both the x-axis and y-axis results in the same graph.\n\n3. **Symmetry about the line $y = x$**: The graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric about the line $y = x$. For instance, if you have a function \(f(x)\) and its inverse \(f^{-1}(x)\), the points \((a, b)\) on the graph of $f$ correspond to the points \((b, a)\) on the graph of $f^{-1}$.\n\n### Example of Symmetry\n\nConsider the function $y = x^2$:\n\n- **Graph**: The graph of $y = x^2$ is a parabola that opens upwards.\n- **Symmetry**: If you take any point on the graph, say \((2, 4)\), you will find that the point \((-2, 4)\) is also on the graph. This demonstrates symmetry about the y-axis.\n\nIn contrast, for the function $y = x^3$:\n\n- **Graph**: The graph of $y = x^3$ is an S-shaped curve that passes through the origin.\n- **Symmetry**: If you take the point \((1, 1)\), you will find that the point \((-1, -1)\) is also on the graph, illustrating symmetry about the origin.\n\nRecognizing these symmetries can be very useful in graphing functions and understanding their behavior without having to plot every point.
