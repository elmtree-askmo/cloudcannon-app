    Describe a non-example of induction using the Fibonacci sequence.
answer: >-
    A non-example of induction using the Fibonacci sequence can be illustrated by attempting to prove a statement that is not universally true for all natural numbers. \n\nFor instance, consider the statement: "All Fibonacci numbers are even." This statement can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1. **Base Case**: Check the first Fibonacci numbers:\n   - $ F_0 = 0 $ (even)\n   - $ F_1 = 1 $ (odd)\n   \n   The base case fails because $ F_1 $ is not even.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some $ n $, all Fibonacci numbers $ F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_n $ are even. We need to show that $ F_{n+1} $ is also even. According to the Fibonacci sequence definition, $ F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} $. If both $ F_n $ and $ F_{n-1} $ were even (which is our assumption), then their sum $ F_{n+1} $ would also be even. However, since we already established that $ F_1 $ is odd, the assumption does not hold for all $ n $.\n\nThis example demonstrates a failure of induction because the initial assumption (that all Fibonacci numbers are even) is false. Therefore, it cannot be proven by induction, as the base case itself does not satisfy the condition. \n\nIn summary, the statement "All Fibonacci numbers are even" serves as a non-example of induction, as it fails at the base case and does not hold true for all natural numbers.
