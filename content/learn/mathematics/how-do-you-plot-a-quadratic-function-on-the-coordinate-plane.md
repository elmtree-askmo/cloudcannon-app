    How do you plot a quadratic function on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To plot a quadratic function on the coordinate plane, you can follow these detailed steps:\n\n### 1. Identify the Quadratic Function\nEnsure that the quadratic function is in standard form, which is given by:\n$$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\nwhere $ a \neq 0 $. The value of $ a $ determines the direction of the parabola (upward if $ a > 0 $ and downward if $ a < 0 $).\n\n### 2. Find the Vertex\nThe vertex of the parabola is a key point that can be found using the formula for the x-coordinate:\n$$\nx = -\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\nOnce you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the quadratic equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate. This gives you the vertex \((h, k)\).\n\n### 3. Determine the Axis of Symmetry\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, given by the equation:\n$$\nx = -\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\n\n### 4. Create a Table of Values\nChoose several x-values around the vertex to calculate corresponding y-values. This will help you plot additional points on the graph. For example, if your function is \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \), you might calculate values for $ x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 $.\n\n### 5. Plot the Points\nUsing the table of values, plot each point \((x, f(x))\) on the coordinate plane. For instance, if you calculated the following points:\n\n| $ x $ | \( f(x) \) |\n|---------|------------|\n| 0       | 3          |\n| 1       | 0          |\n| 2       | -1         |\n| 3       | 0          |\n| 4       | 3          |\n\nYou would plot the points (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, -1), (3, 0), and (4, 3).\n\n### 6. Connect the Points\nAfter plotting the points, connect them with a smooth curve. Since the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, ensure that the curve is symmetric about the axis of symmetry.\n\n### 7. Label the Axes\nMake sure to label the x-axis and y-axis appropriately, and provide a title for your graph. This helps in understanding the context of the plotted function.\n\n### Example\nFor the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \):\n1. The vertex is at \( (2, -1) \).\n2. The axis of symmetry is $ x = 2 $.\n3. You can create a table of values and plot points as described above.\n4. Finally, connect the points to form a parabola.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively plot a quadratic function on the coordinate plane, allowing for a visual representation of its characteristics and behavior.
