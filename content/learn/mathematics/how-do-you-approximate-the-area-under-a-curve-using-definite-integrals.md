    To approximate the area under a curve using definite integrals, we utilize the concept of integration, which allows us to calculate the total accumulation of a function's values over a specified interval. The area under a curve can be represented mathematically by the definite integral of a function \( f(x) \) from $ a $ to $ b $:\n\n$$\n\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n$$\n\n### Steps to Approximate the Area Under a Curve\n\n1. **Choose the Function and Interval**: Identify the function \( f(x) \) whose area under the curve you want to approximate and the interval $[a, b]$ over which you want to calculate the area.\n\n2. **Partition the Interval**: Divide the interval $[a, b]$ into $ n $ subintervals of equal width $ \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n} $.\n\n3. **Select Sample Points**: For each subinterval, choose a sample point $ x_i^* $ (this could be the left endpoint, right endpoint, or midpoint of the subinterval).\n\n4. **Calculate the Area of Rectangles**: For each subinterval, calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the height \( f(x_i^*) \) and width $ \Delta x $. The area of each rectangle is given by:\n   $$\n   A_i = f(x_i^*) \Delta x\n   $$\n\n5. **Sum the Areas**: The total approximate area under the curve is the sum of the areas of all rectangles:\n   $$\n   A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\n   $$\n\n6. **Take the Limit**: As $ n $ approaches infinity (which means $ \Delta x $ approaches zero), the approximation becomes exact, leading to the definition of the definite integral:\n   $$\n   A = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n\n### Example\n\nTo illustrate, let's approximate the area under the curve of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 2 $:\n\n1. **Function and Interval**: \( f(x) = x^2 \), interval $[0, 2]$.\n2. **Partition the Interval**: Letâ€™s say we choose $ n = 4 $, so $ \Delta x = \frac{2 - 0}{4} = 0.5 $.\n3. **Select Sample Points**: Using right endpoints, the sample points are $ x_1 = 0.5, x_2 = 1.0, x_3 = 1.5, x_4 = 2.0 $.\n4. **Calculate Areas**:\n   - \( A_1 = f(0.5) \cdot 0.5 = (0.5^2) \cdot 0.5 = 0.125 \)\n   - \( A_2 = f(1.0) \cdot 0.5 = (1.0^2) \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \)\n   - \( A_3 = f(1.5) \cdot 0.5 = (1.5^2) \cdot 0.5 = 1.125 \)\n   - \( A_4 = f(2.0) \cdot 0.5 = (2.0^2) \cdot 0.5 = 2.0 \)\n\n5. **Sum the Areas**:\n   $$\n   A \approx 0.125 + 0.5 + 1.125 + 2.0 = 3.75\n   $$\n\n6. **Exact Area**: The exact area can be calculated using the definite integral:\n   $$\n   \int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the definite integral is a powerful tool in calculus for calculating the area under curves. By approximating the area using rectangles and refining the approximation as the number of rectangles increases, we can arrive at the exact area through the process of integration. This method not only provides a numerical approximation but also deepens our understanding of the relationship between functions and their integrals.
