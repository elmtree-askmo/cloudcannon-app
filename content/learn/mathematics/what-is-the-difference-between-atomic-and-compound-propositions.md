    What is the difference between atomic and compound propositions?
answer: >-
    The difference between atomic and compound propositions lies in their structure and the presence of logical operators.\n\n1. **Atomic Propositions**: An atomic proposition is a basic statement that does not contain any logical operators. It has a definitive truth value, meaning it can be classified as either true or false. Examples of atomic propositions include:\n   - "The sky is blue."\n   - "2 + 2 = 4."\n\n   These statements stand alone and cannot be broken down further in terms of logical structure.\n\n2. **Compound Propositions**: A compound proposition is formed by combining two or more atomic propositions using logical operators such as conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), negation (NOT), implication (IF...THEN), and bi-implication (IF AND ONLY IF). For example, if we let:\n   - $ p $: "It is raining."\n   - $ q $: "I will take an umbrella."\n\n   The compound proposition $ p \land q $ (read as "p and q") means "It is raining and I will take an umbrella." This statement's truth value depends on the truth values of the atomic propositions it combines.\n\nIn summary, atomic propositions are the simplest form of propositions without logical operators, while compound propositions are constructed from atomic propositions using logical operators, allowing for more complex logical expressions.
