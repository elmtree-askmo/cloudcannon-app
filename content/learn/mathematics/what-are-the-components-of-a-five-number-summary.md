    What are the components of a five number summary?
answer: >-
    The five-number summary is a descriptive statistic that provides a concise overview of a dataset's distribution. It consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Minimum**: The smallest value in the dataset.\n2. **First Quartile (Q1)**: The 25th percentile, which indicates that 25% of the data points fall below this value.\n3. **Median (Q2)**: The 50th percentile, representing the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered.\n4. **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The 75th percentile, indicating that 75% of the data points fall below this value.\n5. **Maximum**: The largest value in the dataset.\n\nFor example, consider the dataset {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The five-number summary for this dataset would be:\n- Minimum = 1\n- Q1 = 3\n- Median = 5\n- Q3 = 7\n- Maximum = 9\n\nThis summary provides a quick snapshot of the data's central tendency and variability, and it is often visualized using boxplots, which graphically represent these five components.
