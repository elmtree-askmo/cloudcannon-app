    What happens when a point is reflected across both the x-axis and y-axis?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across both the x-axis and the y-axis, the transformations can be understood step by step.\n\n1. **Reflection Across the x-axis**: \n   - For a point \( P(x, y) \), reflecting it across the x-axis changes its coordinates to \( P'(x, -y) \). This means that the x-coordinate remains the same, while the y-coordinate is negated.\n\n2. **Reflection Across the y-axis**: \n   - After reflecting the point \( P'(x, -y) \) across the y-axis, the new coordinates become \( P''(-x, -y) \). Here, the x-coordinate is negated, while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\nCombining these two reflections, if you start with a point \( P(x, y) \) and reflect it first across the x-axis and then across the y-axis, the final coordinates of the point will be:\n\n$$\nP''(-x, -y)\n$$\n\n### Example:\nLet's take a specific point, say \( P(3, 4) \):\n- Reflecting across the x-axis gives us \( P'(3, -4) \).\n- Reflecting \( P'(3, -4) \) across the y-axis results in \( P''(-3, -4) \).\n\nThus, the final coordinates after reflecting the point \( P(3, 4) \) across both the x-axis and y-axis will be \( P''(-3, -4) \).\n\n### Summary:\nReflecting a point across both the x-axis and y-axis results in a point that is located in the opposite quadrant of the original point, effectively negating both coordinates. This transformation is a type of rigid motion, preserving the distance and orientation in terms of the overall structure of the coordinate plane, but inverting the position of the point.
