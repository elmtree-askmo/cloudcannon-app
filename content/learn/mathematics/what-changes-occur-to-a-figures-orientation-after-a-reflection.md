    What changes occur to a figure's orientation after a reflection?
answer: >-
    After a reflection, the orientation of a figure undergoes a significant change. Specifically, the reflected image is laterally inverted compared to the original figure. This means that while the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, the arrangement of points is reversed relative to the line of reflection.\n\n### Key Points on Orientation Changes After Reflection:\n\n1. **Lateral Inversion**: When a figure is reflected over a line (such as the x-axis or y-axis), the positions of points are flipped. For example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). This inversion results in a mirror image where the left and right sides are swapped.\n\n2. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape, but their orientations differ.\n\n3. **Examples of Orientation Change**:\n   - Reflecting a triangle with vertices at \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 2)\), and \(C(2, 4)\) over the y-axis results in new vertices at \(A'(-1, 2)\), \(B'(-3, 2)\), and \(C'(âˆ’2, 4)\). The triangle appears flipped horizontally.\n   - For a function \(f(x) = x^2\), reflecting it over the x-axis changes it to $y = -x^2$, flipping the parabola upside down.\n\n4. **Orientation in Different Axes**: The orientation change can vary depending on the line of reflection:\n   - **Over the x-axis**: The y-coordinates of points are negated, resulting in a vertical flip.\n   - **Over the y-axis**: The x-coordinates of points are negated, resulting in a horizontal flip.\n   - **Over the line $y = x$**: The coordinates of points are swapped, leading to a diagonal flip.\n\nIn summary, while reflections preserve the size and shape of geometric figures, they alter the orientation by flipping the image across the line of reflection, resulting in a laterally inverted version of the original figure.
