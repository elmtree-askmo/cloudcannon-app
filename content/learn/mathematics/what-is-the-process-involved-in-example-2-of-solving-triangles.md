    What is the process involved in Example 2 of solving triangles?
answer: >-
    In Example 2 of solving triangles, we are dealing with an isosceles triangle where the lengths of the two equal sides are given as 28 units, and the angle between them is 17Â°. The goal is to find the length of the third side of the triangle.\n\nTo solve this triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines, which is particularly useful when we know two sides and the included angle (SAS). The Law of Cosines states:\n\n$$\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C)\n$$\n\nIn this case:\n- Let $ a = 28 $ (one of the equal sides),\n- Let $ b = 28 $ (the other equal side),\n- Let $ C = 17^\circ $ (the included angle),\n- Let $ c $ be the length of the third side we want to find.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula, we have:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 28^2 + 28^2 - 2 \cdot 28 \cdot 28 \cdot \cos(17^\circ)\n$$\n\nCalculating $ 28^2 $:\n\n$$\n28^2 = 784\n$$\n\nNow substituting this back into the equation:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 784 + 784 - 2 \cdot 28 \cdot 28 \cdot \cos(17^\circ)\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\nc^2 = 1568 - 1568 \cdot \cos(17^\circ)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate \( \cos(17^\circ) \) and substitute it into the equation to find $ c^2 $. After calculating $ c^2 $, we take the square root to find $ c $.\n\nThis process effectively allows us to find the length of the third side of the triangle using the Law of Cosines, demonstrating a practical application of trigonometric laws in triangle geometry.
