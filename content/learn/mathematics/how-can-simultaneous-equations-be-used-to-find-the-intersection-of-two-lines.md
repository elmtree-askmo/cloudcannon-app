    How can simultaneous equations be used to find the intersection of two lines?
answer: >-
    To find the intersection of two lines using simultaneous equations, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the equations of the lines**: Ensure that you have the equations of the two lines in a standard form, typically $y = mx + b$ (slope-intercept form), where $m$ is the gradient (slope) and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Set the equations equal to each other**: Since both equations represent $y$, you can set them equal to each other to find the x-coordinate of the intersection point. For example, if you have two equations:\n   $$\n   y = m_1x + b_1\n   $$\n   $$\n   y = m_2x + b_2\n   $$\n   You would set them equal:\n   $$\n   m_1x + b_1 = m_2x + b_2\n   $$\n\n3. **Solve for x**: Rearranging the equation will allow you to solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   m_1x - m_2x = b_2 - b_1\n   $$\n   $$\n   (m_1 - m_2)x = b_2 - b_1\n   $$\n   $$\n   x = \frac{b_2 - b_1}{m_1 - m_2}\n   $$\n\n4. **Substitute x back into one of the original equations**: Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into either of the original equations to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n   $$\n   y = m_1\left(\frac{b_2 - b_1}{m_1 - m_2}\right) + b_1\n   $$\n\n5. **Result**: The point \((x, y)\) you find is the intersection point of the two lines.\n\n### Example\nConsider the lines given by the equations:\n1. $y = 2x + 3$\n2. $y = -x + 1$\n\nSetting them equal:\n$$\n2x + 3 = -x + 1\n$$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$\n2x + x = 1 - 3\n$$\n$$\n3x = -2 \implies x = -\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $x$ back into one of the equations to find $y$:\n$$\ny = 2\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) + 3 = -\frac{4}{3} + 3 = -\frac{4}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\n$$\n\nThus, the intersection point is \(\left(-\frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{3}\right)\).\n\nThis method effectively utilizes simultaneous equations to find the intersection of two lines, providing a clear and systematic approach to solving for the coordinates of the intersection point.
