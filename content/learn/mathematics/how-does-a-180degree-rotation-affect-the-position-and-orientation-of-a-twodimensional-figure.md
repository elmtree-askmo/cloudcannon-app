    How does a 180-degree rotation affect the position and orientation of a two-dimensional figure?
answer: >-
    A 180-degree rotation of a two-dimensional figure around a fixed point, typically the origin, has specific effects on the position and orientation of that figure. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this transformation works:\n\n### Effects of a 180-Degree Rotation\n\n1. **Position Change**: \n   - When a figure is rotated 180 degrees, each point of the figure moves to a new location that is directly opposite its original position relative to the center of rotation. For example, if a point \( (x, y) \) is rotated 180 degrees around the origin, its new coordinates will be \( (-x, -y) \).\n\n2. **Orientation Change**: \n   - The orientation of the figure is inverted. For instance, if the figure has a specific direction (like an arrow pointing up), after a 180-degree rotation, it will point in the opposite direction (downward).\n\n3. **Symmetry**: \n   - A figure that undergoes a 180-degree rotation exhibits rotational symmetry. This means that the figure looks the same after being rotated by 180 degrees. For example, a rectangle or a square will appear unchanged in shape and size after such a rotation.\n\n4. **Quadrant Movement**: \n   - The rotation affects the quadrant in which the points of the figure lie. For example:\n     - Points in the first quadrant (where both coordinates are positive) will move to the third quadrant (where both coordinates are negative).\n     - Points in the second quadrant will move to the fourth quadrant, and vice versa.\n\n### Transformation Rule\nThe transformation rule for a 180-degree rotation about the origin can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n$$\n\n### Example\nConsider a triangle with vertices at \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(3, 4) \), and \( C(5, 1) \). After a 180-degree rotation around the origin, the new coordinates of the vertices will be:\n- \( A'(-1, -2) \)\n- \( B'(-3, -4) \)\n- \( C'(-5, -1) \)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, a 180-degree rotation transforms the position of a two-dimensional figure by moving each point to its opposite location relative to the center of rotation, inverts its orientation, and maintains its shape and size. This transformation is a fundamental concept in geometry and is widely applicable in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering.
