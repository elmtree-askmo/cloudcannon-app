    How can combining like terms and the distributive property be used together to simplify complex expressions?
answer: >-
    Combining like terms and the distributive property are fundamental techniques in algebra that can be used together to simplify complex expressions effectively.\n\n### Combining Like Terms\nCombining like terms involves identifying terms in an algebraic expression that have the same variable part and then adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example, in the expression $3x + 7x$, both terms contain the variable $x$. By combining them, we get:\n\n$$\n3x + 7x = (3 + 7)x = 10x.\n$$\n\n### Distributive Property\nThe distributive property states that when you multiply a single term by a sum or difference within parentheses, you distribute the multiplication across each term inside the parentheses. For example, using the distributive property on the expression \(3(x + 4)\) gives:\n\n$$\n3(x + 4) = 3x + 12.\n$$\n\n### Using Both Techniques Together\nWhen simplifying complex expressions, you can often apply both combining like terms and the distributive property in tandem. For instance, consider the expression:\n\n$$\n2(3x + 4) + 5x - 6.\n$$\n\n1. **Apply the Distributive Property**: First, distribute the $2$ across the terms in the parentheses:\n\n$$\n2(3x) + 2(4) + 5x - 6 = 6x + 8 + 5x - 6.\n$$\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms**: Next, combine the like terms $6x$ and $5x$, as well as the constant terms $8$ and $-6$:\n\n$$\n(6x + 5x) + (8 - 6) = 11x + 2.\n$$\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n$$\n11x + 2.\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nBy using the distributive property to eliminate parentheses and then combining like terms, you can simplify complex algebraic expressions efficiently. This approach not only streamlines the process but also enhances understanding of how different algebraic components interact.
