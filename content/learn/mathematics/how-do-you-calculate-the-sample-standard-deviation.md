    How do you calculate the sample standard deviation?
answer: >-
    To calculate the sample standard deviation, you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\ns = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ s $ is the sample standard deviation.\n- $ n $ is the number of observations in the sample.\n- $ x_i $ represents each individual value in the sample.\n- $ \bar{x} $ is the sample mean, calculated as:\n\n$$\n\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\n\n### Steps to Calculate Sample Standard Deviation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**: First, find the mean ($ \bar{x} $) of your sample data by summing all the values and dividing by the number of observations ($ n $).\n\n2. **Calculate the Deviations**: For each value in your sample, subtract the mean and square the result. This gives you the squared deviations.\n\n3. **Sum the Squared Deviations**: Add all the squared deviations together.\n\n4. **Divide by $ n-1 $**: Divide the total from the previous step by $ n-1 $ (this is known as Bessel's correction, which corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance).\n\n5. **Take the Square Root**: Finally, take the square root of the result from the previous step to obtain the sample standard deviation ($ s $).\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nSuppose you have the following sample data: 4, 8, 6, 5, 3.\n\n1. Calculate the mean:\n   $$ \n   \bar{x} = \frac{4 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 3}{5} = \frac{26}{5} = 5.2 \n   $$\n\n2. Calculate the squared deviations:\n   - \( (4 - 5.2)^2 = 1.44 \)\n   - \( (8 - 5.2)^2 = 7.84 \)\n   - \( (6 - 5.2)^2 = 0.64 \)\n   - \( (5 - 5.2)^2 = 0.04 \)\n   - \( (3 - 5.2)^2 = 4.84 \)\n\n3. Sum the squared deviations:\n   $$ \n   1.44 + 7.84 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 4.84 = 14.8 \n   $$\n\n4. Divide by $ n-1 $ (which is $ 5-1 = 4 $):\n   $$ \n   \frac{14.8}{4} = 3.7 \n   $$\n\n5. Take the square root:\n   $$ \n   s = \sqrt{3.7} \approx 1.92 \n   $$\n\nThus, the sample standard deviation of the data set is approximately 1.92. This value indicates the amount of variation or dispersion in your sample data.
