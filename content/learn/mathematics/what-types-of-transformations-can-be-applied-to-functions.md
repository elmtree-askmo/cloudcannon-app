    What types of transformations can be applied to functions?
answer: >-
    Transformations of functions are essential for understanding how the graphs of functions can be manipulated and analyzed. Here are the main types of transformations that can be applied to functions:\n\n1. **Translations (Shifts)**:\n   - **Horizontal Shifts**: The graph of a function can be shifted left or right. For example, the function \( f(x) = (x - h)^2 \) shifts the graph of \( f(x) = x^2 \) to the right by $ h $ units, while \( f(x) = (x + h)^2 \) shifts it to the left by $ h $ units.\n   - **Vertical Shifts**: The graph can also be shifted up or down. For instance, \( g(x) = f(x) + k \) shifts the graph of \( f(x) \) upwards by $ k $ units, and \( g(x) = f(x) - k \) shifts it downwards by $ k $ units.\n\n2. **Reflections**:\n   - A graph can be reflected across the x-axis or y-axis. For example, \( f(x) = -g(x) \) reflects the graph of \( g(x) \) across the x-axis, while \( f(x) = g(-x) \) reflects it across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Stretches and Compressions**:\n   - **Vertical Stretch/Compression**: This involves multiplying the function by a constant. For example, \( f(x) = k \cdot g(x) \) stretches the graph vertically if $ k > 1 $ and compresses it if $ 0 < k < 1 $.\n   - **Horizontal Stretch/Compression**: This is achieved by modifying the input of the function. For instance, \( f(x) = g(kx) \) compresses the graph horizontally if $ k > 1 $ and stretches it if $ 0 < k < 1 $.\n\n4. **Combining Transformations**:\n   - Multiple transformations can be combined. For example, the function \( f(x) = a \cdot g(b(x - h)) + k \) incorporates vertical and horizontal stretches/compressions, shifts, and reflections, where $ a $ and $ b $ affect the vertical and horizontal scaling, respectively, and $ h $ and $ k $ represent the shifts.\n\n5. **Specific Examples**:\n   - For square root functions, transformations can include vertical shifts (e.g., \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} + 2 \) shifts the graph up by 2 units) and horizontal shifts (e.g., \( g(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \) shifts the graph right by 3 units).\n   - For quadratic functions, the transformation \( y = (x - 4)^2 \) represents a horizontal shift of the parabola $ y = x^2 $ to the right by 4 units.\n\nUnderstanding these transformations is crucial for analyzing and graphing functions effectively, as they allow for the modeling of various real-world scenarios and the exploration of function behaviors.
