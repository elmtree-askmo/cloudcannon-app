    The stars and bars method is a powerful combinatorial technique used to solve problems involving the distribution of indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes. Let's consider an example to illustrate how this method works.\n\nSuppose we want to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n$$\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5\n$$\n\nHere, we want to distribute 5 indistinguishable stars (representing objects) into 3 distinguishable boxes (representing the variables $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$).\n\n### Step 1: Represent the Objects and Dividers\nWe can visualize the 5 stars as follows:\n\n```\n*****\n```\n\nTo separate the stars into three groups (for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$), we need 2 bars. The arrangement of stars and bars will look something like this:\n\n```\n*****|**|*\n```\n\nIn this example, $x_1 = 5$, $x_2 = 2$, and $x_3 = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Total Arrangements\nThe total number of symbols we have is the sum of the stars and the bars. In this case, we have 5 stars and 2 bars, giving us a total of $5 + 2 = 7$ symbols.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Arrangements\nThe number of ways to arrange these symbols (stars and bars) can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n\n$$\n\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of indistinguishable objects (stars) and $k$ is the number of distinguishable boxes (variables). In our case, $n = 5$ and $k = 3$:\n\n$$\n\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{7}{2}\n$$\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n$$\n\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, there are 21 different ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable objects into 3 distinguishable boxes. This example demonstrates how the stars and bars method can be effectively used to solve combinatorial distribution problems.
