    What are horizontal and vertical asymptotes, and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    Asymptotes are important features in the analysis of functions, particularly in understanding their behavior as they approach certain values. There are three main types of asymptotes: vertical, horizontal, and oblique. Here, we will focus on the differences between horizontal and vertical asymptotes.\n\n### Horizontal Asymptotes\nHorizontal asymptotes describe the behavior of a function as the input variable $x$ approaches infinity (or negative infinity). They indicate the value that the function approaches but never actually reaches as $x$ becomes very large or very small. For many functions, including exponential functions, the horizontal asymptote is often the x-axis, represented by the line:\n\n$$\ny = 0\n$$\n\nFor example, consider the exponential function $y = 2^x$:\n- As $x$ approaches negative infinity, $y$ approaches 0. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n\n### Vertical Asymptotes\nVertical asymptotes occur at specific values of $x$ where the function approaches infinity, typically where the function is undefined. These points indicate that the function's value increases or decreases without bound as it approaches the vertical line. For example, the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$ because as $x$ approaches 0 from either side, \(f(x)\) approaches infinity.\n\nIn the context of exponential functions, vertical asymptotes are not common. However, they can occur in more complex functions that include exponential terms in the denominator. For instance, the function:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \frac{1}{e^x}\n$$\n\nhas a vertical asymptote at $x = -\infty$ because as $x$ approaches negative infinity, \(f(x)\) approaches infinity.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Horizontal Asymptotes** indicate the end behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity. They show the value that the function approaches, such as $y = 0$ for many exponential functions.\n- **Vertical Asymptotes** indicate points where the function approaches infinity, typically where the function is undefined. They represent values of $x$ that the function cannot take, leading to infinite behavior.\n\nUnderstanding these asymptotic behaviors is crucial for graphing functions and analyzing their growth or decay characteristics.
