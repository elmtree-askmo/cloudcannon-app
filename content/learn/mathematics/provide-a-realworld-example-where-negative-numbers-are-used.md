    Provide a real-world example where negative numbers are used.
answer: >-
    Negative numbers are widely used in various real-world scenarios. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Temperature Measurement**: In meteorology, negative numbers are used to indicate temperatures below freezing. For instance, a temperature of -10째C signifies that it is ten degrees below zero. This is crucial for weather forecasts and understanding climate conditions.\n\n2. **Banking and Finance**: Negative numbers are employed to represent debts or losses. For example, if a bank account balance is -$50, it indicates that the account is overdrawn by fifty dollars. This helps individuals and businesses track their financial health.\n\n3. **Elevation**: In geography, negative numbers are used to denote elevations below sea level. For example, the Dead Sea is approximately -430 meters below sea level. This information is essential for understanding topography and environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Game Scoring**: In certain games or quizzes, negative scores may be assigned as penalties for incorrect answers. For instance, a player might lose 5 points for a wrong answer, resulting in a score of -5.\n\n5. **Physics and Engineering**: Negative numbers are used in various calculations, such as representing direction in vector analysis. For example, a velocity of -20 m/s could indicate movement in the opposite direction.\n\n6. **Temperature Changes**: In scientific experiments, negative numbers can represent a decrease in temperature. For example, if a substance cools from 5째C to -3째C, the change in temperature can be calculated as -8째C.\n\nThese examples illustrate how negative numbers are integral to various fields, helping to quantify and communicate important information effectively.
