    What is the equation a cos x + b sin x = c and how is it solved?
answer: >-
    The equation of the form $a \cos x + b \sin x = c$ can be solved by rewriting the left-hand side into a single trigonometric function. This is typically done by expressing it in the form \(R \cos(x - \alpha)\) or \(R \sin(x + \alpha)\), where $R$ is the resultant amplitude and $\alpha$ is a phase shift.\n\nTo derive this, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate $R$**: \n   $$ R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$\n\n2. **Determine $\alpha$**: \n   $$ \tan \alpha = \frac{b}{a} $$\n\n3. **Rewrite the equation**: \n   You can express $a \cos x + b \sin x$ as:\n   $$ R \cos(x - \alpha) = c $$ \n   or \n   $$ R \sin(x + \alpha) = c $$\n\n4. **Solve for $x$**: \n   Once you have the equation in one of the above forms, you can solve for $x$ by isolating the trigonometric function:\n   $$ \cos(x - \alpha) = \frac{c}{R} $$ \n   or \n   $$ \sin(x + \alpha) = \frac{c}{R} $$\n\n5. **Find the general solutions**: \n   Depending on the form you used, you can find the solutions for $x$ using the inverse trigonometric functions:\n   - For \( \cos(x - \alpha) = \frac{c}{R} \):\n     $$ x - \alpha = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right) + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x - \alpha = -\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right) + 2k\pi $$\n   - For \( \sin(x + \alpha) = \frac{c}{R} \):\n     $$ x + \alpha = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right) + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x + \alpha = \pi - \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right) + 2k\pi $$\n\n6. **Adjust for the specific interval**: \n   Finally, if you need solutions within a specific interval (e.g., $0 \leq x < 2\pi$), you will need to adjust your solutions accordingly.\n\nThis method allows you to solve the equation systematically and find all possible values of $x$ that satisfy the original equation.
