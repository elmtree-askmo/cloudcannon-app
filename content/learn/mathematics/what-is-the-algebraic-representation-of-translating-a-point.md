    What is the algebraic representation of translating a point?
answer: >-
    The algebraic representation of translating a point in the coordinate plane can be expressed using a simple formula. If you have a point \( P(x, y) \) and you want to translate it by a vector \( \vec{v} = (a, b) \), where $ a $ is the horizontal shift and $ b $ is the vertical shift, the new coordinates \( P'(x', y') \) of the translated point can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nP'(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)\n$$\n\nIn this representation:\n- $ x' $ is the new x-coordinate after translation.\n- $ y' $ is the new y-coordinate after translation.\n- \( (x, y) \) are the original coordinates of the point.\n- \( (a, b) \) are the components of the translation vector.\n\nFor example, if you have a point \( P(2, 3) \) and you want to translate it by the vector \( (4, -1) \), the new point $ P' $ would be calculated as:\n\n$$\nP'(x', y') = (2 + 4, 3 - 1) = (6, 2)\n$$\n\nThis algebraic representation effectively captures the process of translating a point in the coordinate plane.
