    How are the coordinates of a point defined in relation to the origin on a coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    In a coordinate plane, the coordinates of a point are defined in relation to the origin, which is the reference point located at (0, 0). The coordinate system is structured around two perpendicular axes: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. Each point in this system is represented by an ordered pair of numbers, written in the form (x, y).\n\n### Definition of Coordinates:\n- **x-coordinate**: This value indicates the horizontal distance of the point from the origin. A positive x-coordinate means the point is to the right of the origin, while a negative x-coordinate indicates it is to the left.\n- **y-coordinate**: This value indicates the vertical distance of the point from the origin. A positive y-coordinate means the point is above the origin, while a negative y-coordinate indicates it is below.\n\n### Example:\nFor a point P located at (3, 4):\n- The x-coordinate
