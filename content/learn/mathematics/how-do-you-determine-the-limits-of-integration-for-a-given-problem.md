    How do you determine the limits of integration for a given problem?
answer: >-
    To determine the limits of integration for a given problem, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Original Limits**: Start by pinpointing the initial limits of integration, commonly labeled as \(a\) (the lower limit) and \(b\) (the upper limit). These values indicate the starting and ending points of the integration process.\n\n2. **Determine the Context**: The limits of integration are often defined by the specific problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are calculating the area under a curve, the limits will correspond to the x-values between which you want to find that area.\n\n3. **Choose New Limits if Necessary**: In some cases, you may need to change the limits of integration to new values, typically represented as \(c\) (the new lower limit) and \(d\) (the new upper limit). This is particularly relevant when performing substitutions or transformations in the integral.\n\n4. **Check for Finite or Infinite Limits**: The limits can be finite (specific numbers) or infinite (e.g., \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\)). Ensure that the limits you choose are appropriate for the function you are integrating.\n\n5. **Set Up the Integral**: Once you have determined the limits, you can set up the definite integral. For example, the integral of a function \(f(x)\) from \(a\) to \(b\) is represented as:\n   $$\n   \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n\n6. **Evaluate the Integral**: After setting up the integral with the correct limits, you can proceed to evaluate it, which involves finding the antiderivative of \(f(x)\) and applying the limits to obtain the final numeric value.\n\n7. **Consider the Order of Limits**: Remember that swapping the limits of integration (e.g., changing from \(\int_{a}^{b}\) to \(\int_{b}^{a}\)) results in negating the value of the integral:\n   $$\n   \int_{b}^{a} f(x) \, dx = -\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the limits of integration for various problems in calculus.
