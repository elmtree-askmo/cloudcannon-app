answer: >-
    To determine the vertex of a parabola from a quadratic equation in standard form, which is expressed as \n\n$$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants and $ a \neq 0 $, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the x-coordinate of the vertex**: Use the formula \n\n$$\nx = -\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\n\nThis formula gives you the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex**: Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the original quadratic equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n\n$$\ny = a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) + c\n$$\n\n3. **Combine the coordinates**: The vertex of the parabola is then given by the point \n\n$$(h, k)$$ \n\nwhere $ h = -\frac{b}{2a} $ and $ k $ is the value obtained from substituting $ h $ back into the equation.\n\n### Example\nFor a quadratic equation $ y = 2x^2 + 4x + 1 $:\n\n1. Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n   - Here, $ a = 2 $ and $ b = 4 $.\n   - $ x = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot 2} = -\frac{4}{4} = -1 $.\n\n2. Substitute $ x = -1 $ back into the equation to find $ y $:\n   - \( y = 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 1 = 2(1) - 4 + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1 \).\n\n3. Therefore, the vertex is at the point \( (-1, -1) \).\n\nThis method allows you to accurately find the vertex of a parabola represented by a quadratic equation in standard form.
