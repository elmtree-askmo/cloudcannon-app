    How does a reflection transformation affect the coordinates of a point?
answer: >-
    A reflection transformation affects the coordinates of a point by flipping it across a specified line of reflection, which acts as a mirror. The most common lines of reflection are the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$. \n\n### Effects on Coordinates:\n\n1. **Reflection across the x-axis**:\n   - If a point has coordinates \(P(x, y)\), after reflection across the x-axis, the new coordinates will be \(P'(x, -y)\). This means the y-coordinate changes sign while the x-coordinate remains the same.\n   - **Example**: Reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the x-axis results in the point \( (3, -4) \).\n\n2. **Reflection across the y-axis**:\n   - For a point \(P(x, y)\), reflecting it across the y-axis results in new coordinates \(P'(-x, y)\). Here, the x-coordinate changes sign while the y-coordinate remains unchanged.\n   - **Example**: Reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the y-axis gives the point \( (-3, 4) \).\n\n3. **Reflection across the line $y = x$**:\n   - When reflecting a point \(P(x, y)\) over the line $y = x$, the coordinates are swapped, resulting in \(P'(y, x)\).\n   - **Example**: Reflecting the point \( (3, 4) \) over the line $y = x$ results in the point \( (4, 3) \).\n\n### Key Characteristics of Reflection:\n- **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n- **Orientation**: The orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted, meaning that the image appears reversed compared to the original.\n\nUnderstanding these transformations is crucial for analyzing geometric figures and their properties, as well as for graphing functions and exploring their symmetries.
