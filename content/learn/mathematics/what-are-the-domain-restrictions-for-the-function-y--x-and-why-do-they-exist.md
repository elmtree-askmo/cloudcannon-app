    The function y = √x has domain restrictions where x must be greater than or equal to 0, as square roots of negative numbers are not real. The domain is [0, ∞) and the range mirrors this, ensuring real outputs.

    What are the domain restrictions for the function y = √x, and why do they exist?
answer: >-
    The domain restrictions for the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ are defined as $ x \geq 0 $. This restriction exists because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. In mathematical terms, the square root function is only defined for non-negative values of $ x $ since the output must also be a real number.\n\nTo elaborate further:\n\n1. **Domain**: The domain of the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is the set of all $ x $ values for which the function is defined. For this function, the domain is \( [0, \infty) \), meaning it includes all real numbers starting from 0 and extending to positive infinity.\n\n2. **Range**: Correspondingly, the range of the function is also \( [0, \infty) \), as the output of the square root function is always non-negative.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation**: The graph of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ starts at the origin (0,0) and extends to the right, resembling half of the graph of the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \). This graphical behavior reflects the fact that the square root function only produces non-negative outputs.\n\nUnderstanding these domain restrictions is crucial for accurately graphing the function and solving related equations, as it ensures that we only consider valid input values that yield real outputs.
