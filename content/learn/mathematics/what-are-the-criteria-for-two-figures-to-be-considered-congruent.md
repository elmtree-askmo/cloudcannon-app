    Two figures are considered congruent if they can be exactly overlapped through a rigid motion, meaning they have the same size and shape, with all corresponding sides and angles equal. Specific criteria and postulates are used to establish the congruence of triangles.

    What are the criteria for two figures to be considered congruent?
answer: >-
    Two figures are considered congruent if they can be exactly overlapped through a rigid motion, which includes transformations such as translation, rotation, and reflection. This means that congruent figures have the same shape and size, and all corresponding sides and angles are equal.\n\nHere are the key criteria for determining congruence:\n\n1. **Same Size**: The figures must have the same dimensions. This means that all corresponding lengths of sides must be equal.\n\n2. **Same Shape**: The figures must have the same geometric configuration. This implies that all corresponding angles must also be equal.\n\n3. **Corresponding Parts**: For two figures to be congruent, all corresponding parts (sides and angles) must be congruent. This is often denoted by the statement "CPCFC" (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Figures are Congruent).\n\nIn the case of triangles, there are specific criteria known as congruence postulates and theorems that can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent:\n\n- **SSS (Side-Side-Side) Congruence**: If three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n- **SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence**: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n- **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Congruence**: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n- **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) Congruence**: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n- **HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) Congruence**: This applies specifically to right triangles. If the hypotenuse and one leg of one right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one leg of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\nIn summary, two figures are congruent if they can be made to coincide through rigid transformations, and they have equal corresponding sides and angles.
