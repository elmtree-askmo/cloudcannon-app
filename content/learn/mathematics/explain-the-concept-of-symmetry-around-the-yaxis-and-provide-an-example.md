    Explain the concept of symmetry around the y-axis and provide an example.
answer: >-
    The concept of symmetry around the y-axis is a fundamental property in mathematics, particularly in the study of functions and their graphs. A graph is said to be symmetric about the y-axis if, for every point \((x, y)\) on the graph, the point \((-x, y)\) is also present on the graph. This characteristic is typical of even functions.\n\n### Example of Symmetry Around the Y-Axis\n\nA classic example of a function that exhibits symmetry about the y-axis is the quadratic function given by:\n\n$$\ny = x^2.\n$$\n\n#### Graphing the Function\n\n1. **Graph**: The graph of $y = x^2$ is a parabola that opens upwards.\n2. **Symmetry**: To demonstrate the symmetry, consider the point \((2, 4)\) on the graph. The corresponding point \((-2, 4)\) is also on the graph. This can be verified by substituting $-2$ into the function:\n\n   $$\n   y = (-2)^2 = 4.\n   $$\n\n   Thus, both points \((2, 4)\) and \((-2, 4)\) lie on the graph, confirming that it is symmetric about the y-axis.\n\n### Importance of Symmetry\n\nUnderstanding symmetry in graphs simplifies the analysis of functions. For instance, when graphing a function that is symmetric about the y-axis, one can plot points on one side of the y-axis and reflect them to the other side, reducing the amount of computation needed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, symmetry around the y-axis is a key property of even functions, allowing for easier graphing and analysis. The function $y = x^2$ serves as a prime example of this symmetry, illustrating how points on one side of the y-axis correspond to points on the opposite side.
