    What conditions must be met for two lines to intersect?
answer: >-
    For two lines to intersect, several conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Same Plane**: The most fundamental condition is that the two lines must lie in the same plane. If they are not in the same plane, they are classified as skew lines, which do not intersect at any point.\n\n2. **Point of Intersection**: There must be at least one point where the two lines cross each other. This point is referred to as the point of intersection.\n\n3. **Non-Parallel**: The lines must not be parallel. If two lines are parallel, they will never meet, regardless of their extension. In mathematical terms, parallel lines have the same slope, which means they will not intersect.\n\n4. **Equations of the Lines**: If the lines are represented by equations, the solution to the simultaneous equations formed by these lines must yield a valid point (x, y) that satisfies both equations. If the equations lead to a contradiction, the lines do not intersect.\n\n5. **Angle of Intersection**: While not a strict requirement for intersection, if two lines intersect, they can do so at any angle, including 90 degrees if they are perpendicular. However, the angle does not affect the existence of an intersection.\n\nIn summary, for two lines to intersect, they must be in the same plane, not parallel, and there must be a point where they cross. If these conditions are satisfied, the lines will intersect at a single point.
