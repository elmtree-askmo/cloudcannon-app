    List the criteria used to determine if two triangles are congruent.
answer: >-
    To determine if two triangles are congruent, several criteria can be applied. The most commonly used criteria for triangle congruence are:\n\n1. **Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence**: If all three sides of one triangle are equal to the three corresponding sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.\n\n2. **Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence**: If two sides of one triangle are equal to two sides of another triangle, and the included angle between those sides is also equal, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n3. **Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence**: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n4. **Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence**: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\n5. **Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Congruence**: This criterion is specific to right triangles. If the hypotenuse and one leg of one right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one leg of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\nThese criteria ensure that the corresponding sides and angles of the triangles are equal, confirming their congruence.
