    How do you find the derivative of a constant function?
answer: >-
    To find the derivative of a constant function, you can use the fundamental concept that the derivative measures the rate of change of a function. A constant function is defined as a function that does not change its value regardless of the input. For example, if you have a constant function \( f(x) = c \), where $ c $ is a constant, the graph of this function is a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis.\n\nThe derivative of a constant function is always zero. This is because there is no change in the value of the function as the input $ x $ changes. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThis result can also be understood using the limit definition of the derivative:\n\n$$\nf'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}\n$$\n\nFor a constant function \( f(x) = c \):\n\n$$\nf(x_0 + h) = c \quad \text{and} \quad f(x_0) = c\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the limit gives:\n\n$$\nf'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - c}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h} = 0\n$$\n\nThus, the derivative of any constant function is zero, confirming that constant functions do not change and their slope is flat.
