answer: >-
    Units play a crucial role in justifying rearrangements in formulas, primarily through the process of unit analysis. This method allows you to track and verify the units associated with each variable in an equation, ensuring that the manipulations you perform maintain dimensional consistency.\n\nWhen rearranging formulas, it is essential to apply the same mathematical operations to both sides of the equation, as dictated by the properties of equality. For instance, if you have a formula like $y = mx + b$, and you want to solve for $x$, you would first subtract $b$ from both sides, resulting in $y - b = mx$. Then, you would divide both sides by $m$ to isolate $x$, yielding $x = \frac{y - b}{m}$. Throughout this process, you can check the units to ensure that they remain consistent. If $y$ is in meters, $b$ is also in meters, and $m$ is in meters per unit of $x$, the resulting units for $x$ will also be in meters, confirming the correctness of your rearrangement.\n\nMoreover, unit analysis helps in multi-step problems where you may need to convert units or apply different formulas. By keeping track of the units at each step, you can minimize errors and ensure that the final answer is in the desired unit. For example, if you are calculating the area using the formula $A = l \times w$, where $l$ and $w$ are lengths measured in meters, the resulting area $A$ will be in square meters, which can be verified through unit analysis.\n\nIn summary, units not only provide a way to check the correctness of rearrangements in formulas but also guide the solution of multi-step problems by ensuring that all calculations are dimensionally consistent. This practice is essential in both theoretical and practical applications of mathematics and science.
