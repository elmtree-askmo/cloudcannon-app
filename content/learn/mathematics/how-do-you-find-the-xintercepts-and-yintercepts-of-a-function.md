    How do you find the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a function?
answer: >-
    To find the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of a function, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Y-Intercept\nThe y-intercept is the point where the graph of the function crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercept of a function \( f(x) \), you evaluate the function at $ x = 0 $:\n$$\ny\text{-intercept} = f(0)\n$$\nFor example, if you have a quadratic function in standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, the y-intercept is simply the point \( (0, c) \).\n\n### X-Intercepts\nThe x-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. To find the x-intercepts, you need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \). This involves finding the values of $ x $ for which the function equals zero. \n\nFor quadratic functions, you can use the quadratic formula:\n$$\nx = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nThis formula gives you the x-intercepts (roots) of the quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $. The discriminant $ b^2 - 4ac $ indicates the nature of the roots:\n- If $ b^2 - 4ac > 0 $, there are two distinct real x-intercepts.\n- If $ b^2 - 4ac = 0 $, there is one real x-intercept (the vertex of the parabola).\n- If $ b^2 - 4ac < 0 $, there are no real x-intercepts (the graph does not cross the x-axis).\n\n### Summary\n- **Y-Intercept**: Calculate \( f(0) \).\n- **X-Intercepts**: Solve \( f(x) = 0 \) using the quadratic formula for quadratic functions.\n\nThese intercepts provide valuable information about the function's behavior and are essential for graphing the function accurately.
