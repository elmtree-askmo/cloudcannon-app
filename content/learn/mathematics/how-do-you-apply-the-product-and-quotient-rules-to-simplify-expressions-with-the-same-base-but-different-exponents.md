    How do you apply the product and quotient rules to simplify expressions with the same base but different exponents?
answer: >-
    To simplify expressions with the same base but different exponents, you can apply the product and quotient rules of exponents. Hereâ€™s how each rule works:\n\n### Product Rule\nWhen multiplying two expressions with the same base, you add the exponents. This is expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\na^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\n$$\n\n**Example**: If you have the expression $x^2 \cdot x^3$, you can simplify it as follows:\n\n$$\nx^2 \cdot x^3 = x^{2+3} = x^5\n$$\n\n### Quotient Rule\nWhen dividing two expressions with the same base, you subtract the exponents. This is represented as:\n\n$$\n\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\n$$\n\n**Example**: For the expression $\frac{x^5}{x^2}$, the simplification would be:\n\n$$\n\frac{x^5}{x^2} = x^{5-2} = x^3\n$$\n\n### Summary\n- **Product Rule**: Add the exponents when multiplying.\n- **Quotient Rule**: Subtract the exponents when dividing.\n\nThese rules are fundamental in algebra and are essential for simplifying expressions involving exponents efficiently. Understanding and applying these rules correctly can help avoid common mistakes, such as incorrectly adding or multiplying exponents.
