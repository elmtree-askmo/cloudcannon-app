    To calculate the total distance between two points on a number line, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Steps to Calculate Distance\n\n1. **Identify the Points**: Determine the initial and final positions of the points on the number line. Let's denote the initial position as point A and the final position as point B. For example, if point A is at 2.5 and point B is at 9.8.\n\n2. **Calculate Distance**: The distance between two points on a number line is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the two points. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$\n   \text{Distance} = |B - A|\n   $$\n   For our example:\n   $$\n   \text{Distance} = |9.8 - 2.5| = |7.3| = 7.3\n   $$\n   This means the total distance traveled is 7.3 units.\n\n### Example\nIf an object moves from point A (2.5) to point B (9.8) on a number line:\n- **Distance**: 7.3 units (total path length)\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing a number line simplifies the calculation of distance. By identifying the initial and final positions, you can easily compute the total distance traveled by applying basic subtraction and taking the absolute value. This method is particularly useful in one-dimensional motion scenarios.
