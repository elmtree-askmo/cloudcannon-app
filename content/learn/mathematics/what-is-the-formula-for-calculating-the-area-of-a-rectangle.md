    What is the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is straightforward. The area $A$ can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\nA = \text{length} \times \text{width}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- **length** is the longer side of the rectangle.\n- **width** (or breadth) is the shorter side of the rectangle.\n\nIn practical applications, if you are implementing this in a programming context, such as in a class in C++, you would typically define a class that encapsulates the properties of the rectangle and includes a method to calculate the area. Hereâ€™s an example of how this can be implemented in C++:\n\n### Rectangle Class Implementation\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Rectangle {\nprivate:\n    // Private member variables for length and breadth\n    int length;\n    int breadth;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor to initialize length and breadth\n    Rectangle(int l, int b) : length(l), breadth(b) {}\n\n    // Member function to calculate area\n    int area() {\n        return length * breadth; // Area = Length x Breadth\n    }\n\n    // Member function to display dimensions\n    void display() {\n        cout << "Length: " << length << ", Breadth: " << breadth << endl;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `Rectangle` class has private member variables for `length` and `breadth`.\n- The constructor initializes these variables.\n- The `area()` method calculates the area using the formula mentioned above.\n- The `display()` method outputs the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\nThis approach encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a rectangle, making it easy to manage and use in a program.
