answer: >-
    The Zero Exponent Rule states that any nonzero number raised to the power of zero equals one. This rule applies to both numbers and variables. Here are some examples to illustrate the Zero Exponent Rule:\n\n1. For a positive integer:\n   $$ \n   10^0 = 1 \n   $$\n\n2. For a negative integer:\n   $$ \n   (-6)^0 = 1 \n   $$\n\n3. For a fraction:\n   $$ \n   \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^0 = 1 \n   $$\n\n4. For a variable:\n   $$ \n   x^0 = 1 \quad \text{(for } x \neq 0\text{)} \n   $$\n\n5. For a more complex expression:\n   $$ \n   (153 + x)^0 = 1 \quad \text{(if } 153 + x \neq 0\text{)} \n   $$\n\n6. For a sum of variables:\n   $$ \n   (x + y + z)^0 = 1 \quad \text{(if } x + y + z \neq 0\text{)} \n   $$\n\nThese examples demonstrate that regardless of the base (as long as it is not zero), raising it to the power of zero will always yield a result of one. This rule is fundamental in mathematics and helps maintain consistency in the laws of exponents.
