    What is the rule for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin?
answer: >-
    The rule for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin in a 2D coordinate plane is as follows:\n\nIf you have a point \( M(x, y) \), after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, the new coordinates $ M' $ will be given by:\n\n$$\nM' = (y, -x)\n$$\n\nThis means that the x-coordinate of the original point becomes the y-coordinate of the new point, and the y-coordinate of the original point becomes the negative of the x-coordinate of the new point.\n\nFor example, if you have the point \( A(-5, 6) \), after a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin, the new coordinates will be:\n\n1. Original point: \( A(-5, 6) \)\n2. New coordinates after rotation: \( A' = (6, -(-5)) = (6, 5) \)\n\nSimilarly, for other points:\n- For point \( B(3, 7) \): \n  - New coordinates: \( B' = (7, -3) \)\n- For point \( C(2, 1) \): \n  - New coordinates: \( C' = (1, -2) \)\n\nThis transformation is essential in geometry and is widely used in various applications, including computer graphics and robotics, where object orientation is crucial.
