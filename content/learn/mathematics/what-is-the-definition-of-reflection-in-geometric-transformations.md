    What is the definition of reflection in geometric transformations?
answer: >-
    Reflection in geometric transformations is defined as a transformation that flips a shape or object across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This process results in a mirror image of the original shape, which retains the same size and shape but appears reversed or mirrored.\n\n### Key Concepts of Reflection:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: This is the line across which the reflection occurs, acting like a mirror. Common examples of lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$.\n\n2. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n\n3. **Orientation**: Under reflection, the orientation of the shape is laterally inverted. This means that the reflected image will face the opposite direction compared to the original figure.\n\n4. **Algebraic Representation**: If a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, the coordinates of the reflected point $P'$ will be \((-x, y)\). Similarly, reflecting over the x-axis results in \(P'(x, -y)\).\n\n5. **Visualization**: When visualizing reflections, one can think of the line of reflection as a mirror. Points on one side of the line will have corresponding points on the opposite side at equal distances from the line.\n\nIn summary, reflection is a fundamental geometric transformation that creates a mirror image of a shape across a specified line, preserving its size and shape while altering its orientation.
