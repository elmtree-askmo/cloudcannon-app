    What is the conversion factor for converting miles to kilometers?
answer: >-
    The conversion factor for converting miles to kilometers is that 1 mile is equal to approximately 1.609 kilometers. This means that to convert a distance in miles to kilometers, you would multiply the number of miles by 1.609.\n\nFor example, if you want to convert 10 miles to kilometers, you would calculate it as follows:\n\n$$\n10 \text{ miles} \times 1.609 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{mile}} = 16.09 \text{ km}\n$$\n\nThis conversion factor is widely used in various applications, including travel, mapping, and scientific calculations.
