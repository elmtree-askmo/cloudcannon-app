answer: >-
    Right rectangular prisms differ from other types of prisms primarily in their geometric properties and the nature of their faces. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Base Shape**: A right rectangular prism specifically has rectangular bases. In contrast, other types of prisms can have different polygonal bases, such as triangular, pentagonal, or hexagonal. For example, a triangular prism has triangular bases, while a hexagonal prism has hexagonal bases.\n\n2. **Face Angles**: In a right rectangular prism, all angles formed between the faces are right angles (90 degrees). This is not necessarily the case for other prisms. For instance, in an oblique prism, the lateral faces are parallelograms, and the angles can vary, leading to non-right angles.\n\n3. **Lateral Faces**: The lateral faces of a right rectangular prism are rectangles, while in other prisms, the lateral faces can be parallelograms of various shapes depending on the base polygon. For example, in a triangular prism, the lateral faces are typically parallelograms that connect the corresponding sides of the triangular bases.\n\n4. **Cross Sections**: Any cross-section parallel to the base of a right rectangular prism will also be a rectangle, maintaining the same dimensions as the base. In other types of prisms, the cross-sections can vary based on the shape of the base.\n\n5. **Volume and Surface Area Formulas**: The formulas for calculating the volume and surface area of a right rectangular prism are specific to its rectangular shape. The volume is calculated as:\n   $$ \n   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \n   $$\n   The surface area can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   SA = 2(\text{length} \times \text{width} + \text{width} \times \text{height} + \text{height} \times \text{length})\n   $$\n\nIn summary, the defining characteristics of right rectangular prisms—rectangular bases, right angles, and rectangular lateral faces—set them apart from other types of prisms, which may have different base shapes and angles.
