    What are the defining characteristics of parallel lines?
answer: >-
    Parallel lines are a fundamental concept in geometry, characterized by several defining properties. Here are the key characteristics of parallel lines:\n\n1. **Equidistance**: Parallel lines maintain a constant distance from each other at all points along their lengths. This means that no matter how far the lines are extended, the distance between them remains the same.\n\n2. **Equal Slopes**: In a coordinate system, two lines are considered parallel if they have the same slope. This can be expressed mathematically using the slope-intercept form of a line, which is $y = mx + b$. If two lines are represented as $y = m_1x + b_1$ and $y = m_2x + b_2$, they are parallel if $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2$. This indicates that they rise and run at the same rate but are positioned differently on the graph.\n\n3. **Non-Intersecting**: By definition, parallel lines do not intersect at any point. This means that even if the lines are extended infinitely in both directions, they will never meet.\n\n4. **Direction**: Parallel lines can be oriented in various directions, including horizontal and vertical, but they will always run in the same direction without converging.\n\n5. **Angle Relationships with Transversals**: When a transversal (a line that crosses two or more lines) intersects parallel lines, it creates specific angle relationships. For example, alternate interior angles are equal, corresponding angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).\n\nThese characteristics are essential for understanding the behavior of parallel lines in various mathematical contexts, including geometry and algebra.
