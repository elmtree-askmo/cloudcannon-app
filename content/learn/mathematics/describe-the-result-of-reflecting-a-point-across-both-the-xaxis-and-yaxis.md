    Describe the result of reflecting a point across both the x-axis and y-axis.
answer: >-
    To reflect a point across both the x-axis and the y-axis, we can follow a step-by-step process. Let's denote the original point as \((x, y)\).\n\n1. **Reflecting across the x-axis**: When a point \((x, y)\) is reflected across the x-axis, the x-coordinate remains unchanged, while the y-coordinate changes sign. The new coordinates after this reflection will be:\n   $$\n   (x, -y)\n   $$\n\n2. **Reflecting across the y-axis**: Next, we take the point \((x, -y)\) and reflect it across the y-axis. In this case, the y-coordinate remains unchanged, while the x-coordinate changes sign. The new coordinates after this reflection will be:\n   $$\n   (-x, -y)\n   $$\n\nThus, the result of reflecting a point \((x, y)\) first across the x-axis and then across the y-axis is the point \((-x, -y)\).\n\n### Example\nFor example, if we start with the point \((3, 4)\):\n- Reflecting across the x-axis gives us \((3, -4)\).\n- Reflecting \((3, -4)\) across the y-axis gives us \((-3, -4)\).\n\nTherefore, the final result of reflecting the point \((3, 4)\) across both axes is \((-3, -4)\). \n\nThis process illustrates how reflections in the coordinate plane can be systematically applied to determine the new coordinates of a point after multiple transformations.
