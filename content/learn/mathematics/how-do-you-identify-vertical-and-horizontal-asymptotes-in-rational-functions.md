    How do you identify vertical and horizontal asymptotes in rational functions?
answer: >-
    To identify vertical and horizontal asymptotes in rational functions, follow these steps:\n\n### Vertical Asymptotes\nVertical asymptotes occur at values of $ x $ where the function approaches infinity, which typically happens when the denominator of the rational function is zero (and the numerator is not zero at that point). \n\n1. **Set the Denominator to Zero**: For a rational function of the form \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), find the values of $ x $ that make \( Q(x) = 0 \).\n2. **Check the Numerator**: Ensure that \( P(x) \) is not also zero at those points. If both \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are zero, you may have a hole instead of a vertical asymptote.\n\n**Example**: For the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \):\n- Set the denominator $ x - 1 = 0 $ to find $ x = 1 $.\n- Check the numerator: \( P(1) = 1^2 - 1 = 0 \). Since both the numerator and denominator are zero, there is a hole at $ x = 1 $, not a vertical asymptote.\n\n### Horizontal Asymptotes\nHorizontal asymptotes describe the behavior of the function as $ x $ approaches infinity (or negative infinity). The rules for finding horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator:\n\n1. **Degree of the Numerator < Degree of the Denominator**: The horizontal asymptote is $ y = 0 $.\n2. **Degree of the Numerator = Degree of the Denominator**: The horizontal asymptote is $ y = \frac{a}{b} $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, respectively.\n3. **Degree of the Numerator > Degree of the Denominator**: There is no horizontal asymptote; instead, there may be an oblique (slant) asymptote.\n\n**Example**: For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 3}{x^2 - 4} \):\n- The degrees of the numerator and denominator are both 2.\n- The leading coefficients are 2 (numerator) and 1 (denominator), so the horizontal asymptote is $ y = \frac{2}{1} = 2 $.\n\nIn summary, to find vertical asymptotes, set the denominator to zero and check the numerator, while for horizontal asymptotes, compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator to determine the behavior as $ x $ approaches infinity.
