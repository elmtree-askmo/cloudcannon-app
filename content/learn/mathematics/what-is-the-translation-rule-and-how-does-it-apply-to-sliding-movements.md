    The translation rule in geometry describes how to move a shape or figure in a plane without altering its size, shape, or orientation. This transformation is often referred to as a "slide" because it involves shifting every point of the figure the same distance in a specified direction.\n\n### Translation Rule\nThe general translation rule can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + a, y + b)$$\nwhere:\n- \( (x, y) \) are the original coordinates of a point in the figure,\n- $ a $ is the horizontal shift (positive for right, negative for left),\n- $ b $ is the vertical shift (positive for up, negative for down).\n\n### Application to Sliding Movements\nWhen applying the translation rule to sliding movements, every point of the geometric figure is moved according to the specified values of $ a $ and $ b $. For example, if a triangle is to be translated 4 units to the right and 2 units up, the translation rule would be:\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + 4, y + 2)$$\n\nThis means that if a point on the triangle has coordinates \( (2, 3) \), after translation, its new coordinates would be:\n$$(2, 3) \rightarrow (2 + 4, 3 + 2) = (6, 5)$$\n\n### Characteristics of Translation\n1. **Isometry**: Translations are isometric transformations, meaning they preserve distances and angles. The pre-image and image of the figure are congruent.\n2. **Direction and Distance**: The translation can occur in any direction (left, right, up, down) and by any distance, as defined by the values of $ a $ and $ b $.\n3. **No Rotation or Reflection**: During translation, the figure does not rotate or reflect; it simply shifts position.\n\n### Example\nIf we consider Jack's example where point $ J $ moves from \( (-2, 6) \) to \( (4, 9) \), we can determine the translation rule by calculating the changes in the x and y coordinates:\n- Change in x: \( 4 - (-2) = 6 \)\n- Change in y: $ 9 - 6 = 3 $\n\nThus, the mapping rule for this translation can be expressed as:\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + 6, y + 3)$$\n\nIn summary, the translation rule is a fundamental concept in geometry that allows for the sliding of shapes in a coordinate plane while maintaining their properties.
