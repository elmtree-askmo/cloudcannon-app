    What are the characteristics of the graph of y = √x?
answer: >-
    The graph of the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ has several key characteristics that define its shape and behavior:\n\n1. **Domain and Range**:\n   - The domain of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is $ x \geq 0 $ because the square root function is only defined for non-negative values of $ x $.\n   - The range is also $ y \geq 0 $ since the output of the square root function is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Shape**:\n   - The graph resembles half of a parabola that opens to the right. It starts at the origin (0,0) and extends infinitely to the right as $ x $ increases.\n\n3. **Intercepts**:\n   - The graph has one intercept, which is the origin (0,0). This is where the graph starts.\n\n4. **Increasing Behavior**:\n   - The function is monotonically increasing, meaning that as $ x $ increases, $ y $ also increases. The slope of the graph decreases as $ x $ increases, indicating that the rate of increase slows down.\n\n5. **Symmetry**:\n   - The graph of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is not symmetric about the y-axis or x-axis. However, it is related to the quadratic function $ y = x^2 $ in that they are inverse functions of each other. The graph of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ can be seen as the right half of the parabola defined by $ y = x^2 $.\n\n6. **Asymptotic Behavior**:\n   - There are no asymptotes for the graph of $ y = \sqrt{x} $. The graph continues to rise without bound as $ x $ increases.\n\n7. **Graphing Method**:\n   - To graph $ y = \sqrt{x} $, one can create a table of values for non-negative $ x $ values (e.g., $ x = 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 $) and calculate the corresponding $ y $ values (e.g., $ y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 $). These points can then be plotted and connected with a smooth curve.\n\nIn summary, the graph of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is a smooth curve starting at the origin, extending to the right, with a domain and range of non-negative values, and it exhibits increasing behavior without any asymptotes.
