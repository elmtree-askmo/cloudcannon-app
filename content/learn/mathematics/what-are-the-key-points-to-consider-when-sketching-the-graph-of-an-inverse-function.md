    What are the key points to consider when sketching the graph of an inverse function?
answer: >-
    When sketching the graph of an inverse function, there are several key points to consider:\n\n1. **Reflection Over the Line $y = x$**: The graph of the inverse function \(y = f^{-1}(x)\) is obtained by reflecting the graph of the original function \(y = f(x)\) across the line $y = x$. This means that if a point \((a, b)\) lies on the graph of $f$, then the point \((b, a)\) will lie on the graph of $f^{-1}$.\n\n2. **One-to-One Function**: For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (bijective). This means that each output value must correspond to exactly one input value. If the function is not one-to-one, it will not have an inverse that is also a function.\n\n3. **Domain and Range**: The domain of the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is the range of the original function $f$, and the range of $f^{-1}$ is the domain of $f$. Understanding these relationships is crucial for accurately sketching the inverse.\n\n4. **Symmetry**: The graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric about the line $y = x$. This symmetry can be used as a visual aid when sketching the inverse function.\n\n5. **Critical Points and Behavior**: Identify critical points, local maxima and minima, and asymptotes of the original function. The behavior of the inverse function at these points will be the opposite. For example, if $f$ has a local maximum at \((a, b)\), then $f^{-1}$ will have a local minimum at \((b, a)\).\n\n6. **Continuity and Discontinuity**: If the original function is continuous, the inverse will also be continuous in the intervals where the original function is one-to-one. Discontinuities in the original function can affect the existence and continuity of the inverse.\n\n7. **Graphing Steps**: To graph the inverse function:\n   - Start by plotting the original function.\n   - Reflect key points across the line $y = x$.\n   - Connect these points smoothly, considering the overall shape and behavior of the original function.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can effectively sketch the graph of an inverse function and understand its relationship to the original function.
