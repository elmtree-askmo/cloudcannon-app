    How does a reflection impact the coordinates of a geometric figure?
answer: >-
    A reflection in geometry is a transformation that flips a geometric figure across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This transformation results in a mirror image of the original figure, preserving its size and shape but altering its orientation. The impact of a reflection on the coordinates of a geometric figure can be understood through the following key concepts:\n\n### 1. Line of Reflection\nThe line of reflection acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include:\n- The **x-axis**: Reflecting a point \( (x, y) \) over the x-axis results in the new coordinates \( (x, -y) \).\n- The **y-axis**: Reflecting a point \( (x, y) \) over the y-axis results in the new coordinates \( (-x, y) \).\n- The **line $ y = x $**: Reflecting a point \( (x, y) \) over this line results in the new coordinates \( (y, x) \).\n\n### 2. Isometric Transformation\nReflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape. This property ensures that the reflected image is identical in size and shape to the original figure.\n\n### 3. Orientation\nWhile the size and shape remain unchanged, the orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted. For example, if a point \( P(x, y) \) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \( (-x, y) \). This inversion can be visualized as flipping the figure over the line of reflection.\n\n### 4. Mathematical Representation\nIn the context of functions, reflection can be expressed mathematically:\n- To reflect a function \( y = f(x) \) over the x-axis, the transformation is given by \( y = -f(x) \).\n- To reflect over the y-axis, the transformation is \( y = f(-x) \).\n- A reflection over both axes can be represented as \( y = -f(-x) \).\n\n### Examples\n- If we take the point \( (3, 4) \) and reflect it over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be \( (-3, 4) \).\n- For a function \( f(x) = x^2 \), reflecting it over the x-axis results in $ y = -x^2 $, which flips the parabola upside down.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, a reflection impacts the coordinates of a geometric figure by altering their positions based on the line of reflection while preserving the figure's size and shape. The transformation results in a congruent image that is laterally inverted relative to the original figure. This concept is fundamental in geometry and has applications in various fields, including computer graphics and physics.
