    How can rotation be used to adjust the orientation of a figure?
answer: >-
    Rotation is a fundamental transformation in geometry that involves turning a figure around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation, by a specified angle. This transformation is particularly useful for adjusting the orientation of a figure while preserving its shape and size.\n\n### How Rotation Adjusts Orientation\n\n1. **Fixed Point**: The center of rotation is the point around which the figure is turned. This point can be located inside, outside, or on the figure itself. For example, if you rotate a triangle around one of its vertices, that vertex serves as the center of rotation.\n\n2. **Angle of Rotation**: The angle specifies how far the figure is turned. Common angles include 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. For instance, rotating a triangle 90 degrees clockwise will change its orientation significantly, while a 180-degree rotation will flip it upside down.\n\n3. **Maintaining Congruence**: One of the key properties of rotation is that it is a rigid transformation. This means that the distances between points and the angles within the figure remain unchanged. Therefore, the rotated figure is congruent to the original figure.\n\n4. **Example**: Consider a triangle with vertices A(1, 2), B(3, 4), and C(5, 2). If we rotate this triangle 90 degrees clockwise around the origin (0, 0), the new coordinates of the vertices can be calculated using the rotation formulas:\n   - New coordinates for point A: \( A'(-2, 1) \)\n   - New coordinates for point B: \( B'(-4, 3) \)\n   - New coordinates for point C: \( C'(-2, 5) \)\n\n5. **Applications**: Rotation is widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, robotics, and architecture, where adjusting the orientation of objects is essential for design and functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, rotation is a powerful tool for adjusting the orientation of geometric figures. By specifying a center of rotation and an angle, one can effectively manipulate the position of a figure while ensuring that its shape and size remain unchanged. This property of maintaining congruence makes rotation a vital concept in geometry and its applications.
