    Describe the key features of a quadratic function graph.
answer: >-
    The key features of a quadratic function graph, which is typically represented in the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, include the following:\n\n1. **Shape**: The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. Depending on the coefficient $ a $:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards.\n   - If $ a < 0 $, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on the direction it opens. The vertex can be found using the formula:\n   $$\n   h = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   where $ h $ is the x-coordinate of the vertex. The y-coordinate can be found by substituting $ h $ back into the function.\n\n3. **Axis of Symmetry**: The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line known as the axis of symmetry, which passes through the vertex. The equation of the axis of symmetry is given by:\n   $$\n   x = h\n   $$\n\n4. **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. It can be found by evaluating the function at $ x = 0 $, which gives the point \( (0, c) \).\n\n5. **X-Intercepts (Roots)**: The points where the graph intersects the x-axis can be found by solving the equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $. These points can be real or complex, depending on the discriminant $ D = b^2 - 4ac $:\n   - If $ D > 0 $, there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If $ D = 0 $, there is one real root (the vertex lies on the x-axis).\n   - If $ D < 0 $, there are no real roots (the parabola does not intersect the x-axis).\n\n6. **Direction of Opening**: As mentioned, the sign of $ a $ determines whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards, which affects the maximum or minimum value of the function.\n\n7. **Range**: The range of the quadratic function depends on the vertex:\n   - If the parabola opens upwards, the range is \( [k, \infty) \) where $ k $ is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n   - If it opens downwards, the range is $ (-\infty, k] $.\n\n8. **Symmetry**: The graph exhibits symmetry about the axis of symmetry, meaning that for any point \( (x, y) \) on the graph, the point \( (2h - x, y) \) will also be on the graph.\n\nThese features are essential for analyzing and graphing quadratic functions effectively, allowing for a deeper understanding of their behavior and applications in various contexts.
