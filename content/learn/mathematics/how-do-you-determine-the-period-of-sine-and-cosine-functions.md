answer: >-
    To determine the period of sine and cosine functions, we can refer to the concept of periodicity in trigonometric functions. Both the sine function, denoted as $\sin(x)$, and the cosine function, denoted as $\cos(x)$, have a fundamental period of $2\pi$. This means that the values of these functions repeat every $2\pi$ radians.\n\n### Explanation of Periodicity\n\n1. **Definition of Period**: The period of a function is the smallest positive value $T$ such that the function satisfies the equation:\n   $$ f(x + T) = f(x) $$\n   for all $x$ in the domain of the function.\n\n2. **Sine and Cosine Functions**: For the sine and cosine functions:\n   - The sine function can be expressed as:\n     $$ \sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x) $$\n   - The cosine function can be expressed as:\n     $$ \cos(x + 2\pi) = \cos(x) $$\n\n3. **Graphical Representation**: When graphed, both functions exhibit a wave-like pattern that repeats every $2\pi$ radians. The graph of $\sin(x)$ starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1 at $\frac{\pi}{2}$, returns to 0 at $\pi$, reaches a minimum of -1 at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and returns to 0 at $2\pi$. The cosine function starts at 1, decreases to 0 at $\frac{\pi}{2}$, reaches -1 at $\pi$, returns to 0 at $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, and returns to 1 at $2\pi$.\n\n### Transformations Affecting Period\n\nThe period can be altered by applying transformations to the functions. For example, if we have a function of the form:\n$$ f(x) = \sin(kx) \quad \text{or} \quad f(x) = \cos(kx) $$\nthe period of these transformed functions is given by:\n$$ T = \frac{2\pi}{|k|} $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant that affects the frequency of the wave. A larger value of $k$ results in a shorter period, while a smaller value of $k$ results in a longer period.\n\n### Summary\n\n- The standard period of the sine and cosine functions is $2\pi$.\n- The period can be modified by the coefficient of $x$ in the function, specifically using the formula $T = \frac{2\pi}{|k|}$ for transformations.\n\nThis understanding of periodicity is crucial in various applications, including modeling waves, oscillations, and circular motion.
