    How does the concept of linear combinations apply to solving systems of equations?
answer: >-
    The concept of linear combinations is fundamental in solving systems of equations, particularly systems of linear equations. A linear combination involves taking multiple equations and combining them in such a way that simplifies the system, often leading to a solution.\n\nWhen dealing with a system of linear equations, the goal is to find values for the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously. The linear combination method allows us to manipulate the equations to eliminate one or more variables, making it easier to solve for the remaining variables. Hereâ€™s how the process typically works:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equations**: First, the equations are rearranged so that they align in a standard form, typically $Ax + By = C$.\n\n2. **Multiplying Equations**: Next, one or both equations may be multiplied by constants to create coefficients that are opposites for one of the variables. This step is crucial for eliminating that variable when the equations are added together.\n\n3. **Adding the Equations**: The modified equations are then added together. This addition results in the elimination of one variable, allowing for a simpler equation with a single variable.\n\n4. **Solving for the Remaining Variable**: Once one variable is isolated, it can be solved directly. The value obtained can then be substituted back into one of the original equations to find the other variable(s).\n\nFor example, consider the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\begin{align*}\n4x - 7y &= 28 \quad (1) \\\n6x - 5y &= 31 \quad (2)\n\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo solve this using linear combinations, we might multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by -2 to align the coefficients of $x$:\n\n$$\n\begin{align*}\n12x - 21y &= 84 \quad (3) \\\n-12x + 10y &= -62 \quad (4)\n\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAdding equations (3) and (4) results in:\n\n$$\n-11y = 22 \implies y = -2\n$$\n\nSubstituting $y = -2$ back into one of the original equations allows us to solve for $x$.\n\nIn summary, the linear combination method is a powerful technique for solving systems of linear equations, as it simplifies the process of finding solutions by strategically eliminating variables through addition and multiplication of the equations involved.
