answer: >-
    The trapezoidal rule is a numerical integration technique used to approximate the definite integral of a function. It works by dividing the area under the curve into smaller trapezoids rather than rectangles, which allows for a more accurate estimation of the area.\n\n### How the Trapezoidal Rule Works\n\n1. **Dividing the Interval**: The interval \([a, b]\) over which the integral is to be calculated is divided into \(n\) equal subintervals, each of width \(h = \frac{b - a}{n}\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Function Values**: For each subinterval, the function values at the endpoints are calculated. If we denote the function as \(f(x)\), the values at the endpoints are \(f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots, f(x_n)\), where \(x_i = a + ih\) for \(i = 0, 1, \ldots, n\).\n\n3. **Area of Each Trapezoid**: The area \(A_i\) of each trapezoid formed between the points \(x_i\) and \(x_{i+1}\) is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   A_i = \frac{h}{2} \left( f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1}) \right)\n   $$\n   This formula takes the average of the function values at the two endpoints of the subinterval and multiplies it by the width \(h\).\n\n4. **Summing the Areas**: The total area under the curve from \(a\) to \(b\) is then approximated by summing the areas of all trapezoids:\n   $$\n   \text{Total Area} \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} A_i = \frac{h}{2} \left( f(x_0) + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \right)\n   $$\n\n### Advantages and Limitations\n\n- **Accuracy**: The trapezoidal rule provides a good approximation for functions that are approximately linear over small intervals. It gives exact results for polynomials of degree one or less.\n- **Composite Trapezoidal Rule**: For better accuracy, the trapezoidal rule can be applied in a composite manner, where the interval is divided into many smaller subintervals, thus reducing the width \(h\) and increasing the number of trapezoids.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe trapezoidal rule is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics, where it is often necessary to compute areas under curves that cannot be integrated analytically.\n\nIn summary, the trapezoidal rule is a straightforward and effective method for numerical integration, particularly useful when dealing with functions that are difficult to integrate analytically.
