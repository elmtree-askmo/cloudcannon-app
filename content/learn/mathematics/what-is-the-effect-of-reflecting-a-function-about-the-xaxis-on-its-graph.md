    What is the effect of reflecting a function about the x-axis on its graph?
answer: >-
    Reflecting a function about the x-axis has a specific effect on its graph. When you reflect a function over the x-axis, you essentially flip the graph upside down. This transformation can be mathematically represented by negating the output (y-value) of the original function.\n\nFor a given function \( y = f(x) \), the reflected function is given by:\n\n$$\ny = -f(x)\n$$\n\nThis means that for every point \((x, y)\) on the original graph, its reflection across the x-axis will be at the point \((x, -y)\). \n\n### Key Effects of Reflecting a Function about the x-axis:\n1. **Point Transformation**: Each point on the graph is transformed from \((x, y)\) to \((x, -y)\).\n2. **Asymptotes**: If the original function has horizontal asymptotes, these will also be reflected. For example, if $y = k$ is a horizontal asymptote of \(f(x)\), then $y = -k$ will be the horizontal asymptote of \(-f(x)\).\n3. **Symmetry**: The reflected graph will exhibit symmetry with respect to the x-axis. If the original graph has a point above the x-axis, the reflected graph will have a corresponding point below the x-axis at the same horizontal position.\n\n### Example:\nConsider the function \(f(x) = x^2\). The graph of this function is a parabola opening upwards. When reflected over the x-axis, the new function becomes:\n\n$$\nf(x) = -x^2\n$$\n\nThe graph of $y = -x^2$ is a parabola that opens downwards, demonstrating the effect of the reflection.\n\nIn summary, reflecting a function about the x-axis results in a vertical flip of the graph, changing the signs of all the y-values while keeping the x-values unchanged.
