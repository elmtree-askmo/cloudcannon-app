    What happens to the graph of a function when it is reflected over the y-axis?
answer: >-
    When a graph of a function is reflected over the y-axis, the transformation involves negating the input variable of the function. This is mathematically represented as changing the function from \( f(x) \) to \( f(-x) \). \n\n### Effects of Reflection Over the Y-Axis:\n1. **Horizontal Flip**: The graph is flipped horizontally. Points that were originally at \( (x, f(x)) \) will now be at \( (-x, f(x)) \). This means that for every point on the graph, its x-coordinate is negated while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\n2. **Symmetry**: The resulting graph will exhibit symmetry about the y-axis. This means that if you were to fold the graph along the y-axis, the two halves would match perfectly.\n\n3. **Example**: Consider the parent function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The reflection over the y-axis would yield:\n   - Original: \( f(x) = x^2 \)\n   - Reflected: \( f(-x) = (-x)^2 = x^2 \)\n   In this case, the graph remains unchanged because the function is even. However, for a function like \( f(x) = x^3 \):\n   - Original: \( f(x) = x^3 \)\n   - Reflected: \( f(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3 \)\n   Here, the graph changes significantly, reflecting the points across the y-axis.\n\n### Summary:\nReflecting a function over the y-axis alters the orientation of the graph by flipping it horizontally, resulting in a new graph that is symmetric about the y-axis. This transformation is crucial in understanding the behavior of functions and their graphs, especially in the context of even and odd functions.
