answer: >-
    Double angle and half-angle formulas are essential identities in trigonometry that allow for the simplification and evaluation of trigonometric functions for angles that are either double or half of a given angle.\n\n### Double Angle Formulas\nThe double angle formulas express trigonometric functions of double angles (i.e., $2\alpha$) in terms of the functions of the original angle ($\alpha$). The primary double angle formulas are:\n\n1. **Sine**: \n   $$ \n   \sin(2\alpha) = 2\sin(\alpha)\cos(\alpha) \n   $$\n\n2. **Cosine**: \n   $$ \n   \cos(2\alpha) = \cos^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\alpha) \n   $$ \n   This can also be expressed in alternative forms:\n   $$ \n   \cos(2\alpha) = 2\cos^2(\alpha) - 1 \n   $$ \n   $$ \n   \cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2(\alpha) \n   $$\n\n3. **Tangent**: \n   $$ \n   \tan(2\alpha) = \frac{2\tan(\alpha)}{1 - \tan^2(\alpha)} \n   $$\n\nThese formulas are particularly useful for solving trigonometric equations, verifying identities, and simplifying expressions.\n\n### Half-Angle Formulas\nHalf-angle formulas allow for the calculation of trigonometric functions for half of a given angle ($\alpha/2$). The half-angle formulas are derived from the double angle formulas and are expressed as follows:\n\n1. **Sine**: \n   $$ \n   \sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(\alpha)}{2}} \n   $$\n\n2. **Cosine**: \n   $$ \n   \cos\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(\alpha)}{2}} \n   $$\n\n3. **Tangent**: \n   $$ \n   \tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{1 + \cos(\alpha)} = \frac{1 - \cos(\alpha)}{\sin(\alpha)} \n   $$\n\nThe choice of the positive or negative sign in the half-angle formulas depends on the quadrant in which the angle $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ lies.\n\n### Applications\nThe applications of double angle and half-angle formulas are vast, including:\n\n- **Solving Trigonometric Equations**: These formulas simplify the process of solving equations involving trigonometric functions.\n- **Calculus**: In calculus, half-angle formulas are often used to replace squared trigonometric functions with non-squared forms, making integration easier.\n- **Verifying Identities**: They are frequently used to prove trigonometric identities by transforming one side of an equation into the other.\n- **Exact Value Calculations**: They help in finding exact values of trigonometric functions for specific angles.\n\nIn summary, double angle and half-angle formulas are powerful tools in trigonometry that facilitate the manipulation and evaluation of trigonometric functions, making them invaluable in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
