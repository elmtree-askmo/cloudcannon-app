    What is the integration rule for functions of the form f(x) = (x + q)^n?
answer: >-
    To integrate functions of the form \( f(x) = (x + q)^n \), we can use the substitution method along with the power rule for integration. The general integration rule for this type of function can be expressed as follows:\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let $ u = x + q $. Then, the differential $ du = dx $.\n2. **Rewrite the integral**: The integral becomes:\n   $$\n   \int (x + q)^n \, dx = \int u^n \, du\n   $$\n3. **Apply the power rule**: According to the power rule for integration, for any real number $ n \neq -1 $:\n   $$\n   \int u^n \, du = \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n   $$\n4. **Substitute back**: Replace $ u $ with $ x + q $:\n   $$\n   \int (x + q)^n \, dx = \frac{(x + q)^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n   $$\n\nThus, the integration rule for functions of the form \( f(x) = (x + q)^n \) is:\n$$\n\int (x + q)^n \, dx = \frac{(x + q)^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad \text{for } n \neq -1\n$$\n\nThis method effectively simplifies the integration process for polynomial expressions that involve a linear transformation of $ x $.
