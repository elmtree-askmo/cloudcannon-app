    How does Gaussian elimination work in solving linear equations?
answer: >-
    Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is a systematic method for solving systems of linear equations. The process involves a series of row operations performed on the augmented matrix of the system, which consists of the coefficient matrix and the constants from the equations. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how Gaussian elimination works:\n\n### Steps of Gaussian Elimination\n\n1. **Formulate the Augmented Matrix**: Start by writing the system of linear equations in matrix form $AX = B$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $X$ is the column matrix of unknowns, and $B$ is the column matrix of constants. The augmented matrix combines $A$ and $B$ into a single matrix.\n\n   For example, for the system:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   3x - y - z &= 0 \\\n   x + y &= 5 \\\n   2x - 3z &= 2\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n   The augmented matrix is:\n   \[\n   \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c}\n   3 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\n   1 & 1 & 0 & 5 \\\n   2 & 0 & -3 & 2\n   \end{array} \right]\n   \]\n\n2. **Row Operations**: Use elementary row operations to manipulate the matrix. The three types of operations allowed are:\n   - **Swap**: Interchange two rows.\n   - **Scale**: Multiply a row by a non-zero scalar.\n   - **Add**: Add or subtract a multiple of one row to another row.\n\n3. **Achieve Row-Echelon Form**: The goal is to transform the matrix into row-echelon form, where:\n   - All non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros.\n   - The leading coefficient (the first non-zero number from the left, also called a pivot) of a non-zero row is always to the right of the leading coefficient of the previous row.\n   - All entries in a column below a pivot are zeros.\n\n   For instance, through a series of row operations, you might convert the augmented matrix to:\n   \[\n   \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & a \\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & b \\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & c\n   \end{array} \right]\n   \]\n   where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\n4. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in row-echelon form, you can solve for the variables using back substitution. Start from the last row and substitute upwards to find the values of the unknowns.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the following system:\n$$\n\begin{align*}\nx + 2y - z &= 3 \\\n2x - y + 2z &= 6 \\\nx - 3y + 3z &= 4\n\end{align*}\n$$\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\[\n\left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\\n2 & -1 & 2 & 6 \\\n1 & -3 & 3 & 4\n\end{array} \right]\n\]\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, you would perform row operations to achieve row-echelon form, and then use back substitution to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n### Limitations\n\nGaussian elimination is effective for most systems of linear equations, but it does not work on singular matrices (where the determinant is zero), as this leads to division by zero during the process. Additionally, care must be taken with numerical stability in practical applications, especially with large systems.\n\nIn summary, Gaussian elimination is a powerful algorithm for solving linear systems, providing a clear and structured approach to finding solutions through systematic row operations.
