    To write a quadratic equation from a graph by identifying the vertex and axis of symmetry, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertex**: The vertex of a parabola is the highest or lowest point on the graph, depending on whether it opens upwards or downwards. The vertex is typically denoted as \((h, k)\). You can visually identify this point on the graph.\n\n2. **Determine the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. Its equation is given by $x = h$, where $h$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n3. **Use the Vertex Form**: Once you have the vertex \((h, k)\), you can write the quadratic function in vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   Here, $a$ determines the direction and width of the parabola. If the parabola opens upwards, $a$ is positive; if it opens downwards, $a$ is negative.\n\n4. **Find the Value of $a$**: To find the value of $a$, you can use another point on the graph. If you have a point \((x_1, y_1)\) that lies on the parabola, substitute $x_1$ and $y_1$ into the vertex form equation:\n   $$\n   y_1 = a(x_1 - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   Solve for $a$.\n\n5. **Convert to Standard Form (if needed)**: If you need the quadratic in standard form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, you can expand the vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = ax^2 - 2ahx + (ah^2 + k)\n   $$\n   From this, you can identify $b = -2ah$ and $c = ah^2 + k$.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you identify the vertex of the parabola as \((2, 3)\) and you find another point on the graph, say \((3, 5)\).\n\n1. The vertex is \((h, k) = (2, 3)\).\n2. The axis of symmetry is $x = 2$.\n3. Start with the vertex form:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - 2)^2 + 3\n   $$\n4. Substitute the point \((3, 5)\):\n   $$\n   5 = a(3 - 2)^2 + 3 \\\n   5 = a(1) + 3 \\\n   5 - 3 = a \\\n   a = 2\n   $$\n5. The vertex form of the quadratic is:\n   $$\n   y = 2(x - 2)^2 + 3\n   $$\n6. Expanding this gives:\n   $$\n   y = 2(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 3 = 2x^2 - 8x + 8 + 3 = 2x^2 - 8x + 11\n   $$\n   Thus, the standard form is $y = 2x^2 - 8x + 11$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively write a quadratic equation from a graph by identifying the vertex and axis of symmetry.
