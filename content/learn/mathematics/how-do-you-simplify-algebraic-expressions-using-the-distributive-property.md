    How do you simplify algebraic expressions using the distributive property?
answer: >-
    To simplify algebraic expressions using the distributive property, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Expression**: Look for an expression that can be simplified. This often involves a term being multiplied by a sum or difference, such as \(a(b + c)\) or \(a(b - c)\).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property**: The distributive property states that \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\) and \(a(b - c) = ab - ac\). This means you multiply the term outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**: After distributing, you may have like terms that can be combined. For example, if you have $3x + 2x$, you can combine these to get $5x$.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's simplify the expression \(2(x + 3) - 4(x - 1)\):\n\n1. **Distribute**:\n   - For \(2(x + 3)\): \n     $$ \n     2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 3 = 2x + 6 \n     $$\n   - For \(-4(x - 1)\):\n     $$ \n     -4 \cdot x + (-4) \cdot (-1) = -4x + 4 \n     $$\n\n2. **Combine the results**:\n   - Now, combine the distributed terms:\n     $$ \n     2x + 6 - 4x + 4 \n     $$\n\n3. **Combine like terms**:\n   - Combine $2x$ and $-4x$:\n     $$ \n     (2x - 4x) + (6 + 4) = -2x + 10 \n     $$\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n$$\n-2x + 10\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing the distributive property is a powerful technique for simplifying algebraic expressions. It allows you to break down complex expressions into simpler components, making it easier to combine like terms and arrive at a final simplified form. Practice with various expressions will help solidify your understanding of this fundamental algebraic concept.
