answer: >-
    A sample problem for network flow analysis can be illustrated through a classic scenario involving a directed graph representing a network of pipes. In this example, we will define a network with a source node, a sink node, and various intermediate nodes connected by edges that have specific capacities.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nConsider a directed graph $ G $ with the following nodes and edges:\n\n- **Nodes**: $ s $ (source), $ a $, $ b $, $ t $ (sink)\n- **Edges and Capacities**:\n  - \( (s, a) \) with capacity 4\n  - \( (s, b) \) with capacity 3\n  - \( (a, t) \) with capacity 2\n  - \( (b, t) \) with capacity 3\n  - \( (a, b) \) with capacity 1\n\n### Objective\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total flow from the source $ s $ to the sink $ t $ while respecting the capacity constraints on each edge.\n\n### Flow Constraints\n\n1. The flow on edge \( (s, a) \) cannot exceed 4.\n2. The flow on edge \( (s, b) \) cannot exceed 3.\n3. The flow on edge \( (a, t) \) cannot exceed 2.\n4. The flow on edge \( (b, t) \) cannot exceed 3.\n5. The flow from $ a $ to $ b $ cannot exceed 1.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** or the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, which is an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using breadth-first search to find augmenting paths.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with zero flow on all edges.\n2. **Find Augmenting Paths**: Use BFS to find paths from $ s $ to $ t $ that can accommodate additional flow.\n3. **Update Flows**: Increase the flow along the found paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n### Example Flow Calculation\n\n1. Initially, send 2 units of flow from $ s $ to $ a $ and then from $ a $ to $ t $.\n2. Next, send 3 units of flow from $ s $ to $ b $ and then from $ b $ to $ t $.\n3. Finally, send 1 unit of flow from $ a $ to $ b $ (if needed) to utilize the capacity between $ a $ and $ b $.\n\n### Result\n\nAfter applying the above steps, the maximum flow from $ s $ to $ t $ can be calculated, which in this case would be 5 units of flow (2 from $ s $ to $ a $ to $ t $ and 3 from $ s $ to $ b $ to $ t $).\n\nThis example illustrates how network flow analysis can be applied to optimize the flow through a network while adhering to capacity constraints, which is a fundamental concept in operations research and optimization.
