    The product rule in calculus is used to find the derivative of the product of two functions, defined by the formula d/dx(uv) = u'v + uv'. This guide explains the product rule and provides an example with functions x^2 and sin(x), demonstrating how to identify, differentiate, and substitute into the product rule.

answer: >-
    The product rule is a fundamental rule in calculus used to find the derivative of the product of two functions. If you have two differentiable functions, \( u(x) \) and \( v(x) \), the product rule states that the derivative of their product is given by:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx}(uv) = u'v + uv'\n$$\n\nHere, $ u' $ is the derivative of $ u $ with respect to $ x $, and $ v' $ is the derivative of $ v $ with respect to $ x $.\n\n### Application of the Product Rule\n\nTo apply the product rule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Functions**: Determine which parts of your expression are the functions $ u $ and $ v $.\n2. **Differentiate Each Function**: Compute the derivatives $ u' $ and $ v' $.\n3. **Substitute into the Product Rule Formula**: Plug the functions and their derivatives into the product rule formula.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider an example where \( u(x) = x^2 \) and \( v(x) = \sin(x) \).\n\n1. **Identify the Functions**:\n   - \( u(x) = x^2 \)\n   - \( v(x) = \sin(x) \)\n\n2. **Differentiate Each Function**:\n   - \( u' = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x \)\n   - \( v' = \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x) \)\n\n3. **Substitute into the Product Rule Formula**:\n   - Using the product rule:\n   $$\n   \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 \sin(x)) = (2x)(\sin(x)) + (x^2)(\cos(x))\n   $$\n   - Therefore, the derivative of \( x^2 \sin(x) \) is:\n   $$\n   2x \sin(x) + x^2 \cos(x)\n   $$\n\nThis example illustrates how the product rule is applied to find the derivative of a product of two functions. The product rule is particularly useful in calculus when dealing with more complex functions that are products of simpler functions.
