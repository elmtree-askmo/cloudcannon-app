    What is a perpendicular bisector, and what are its key properties?
answer: >-
    A **perpendicular bisector** is a specific type of line that has two key characteristics:\n\n1. **It passes through the midpoint of a line segment**: For any given line segment, the perpendicular bisector will intersect the segment at its midpoint, effectively dividing the segment into two equal parts.\n\n2. **It is perpendicular to the line segment**: The perpendicular bisector forms a right angle (90 degrees) with the line segment it bisects. This means that if you were to draw the perpendicular bisector, it would intersect the segment at a right angle.\n\n### Key Properties of Perpendicular Bisectors:\n\n1. **Equidistance**: Any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant from the endpoints of the line segment. This property is crucial in various geometric constructions and proofs.\n\n2. **Construction**: To construct a perpendicular bisector of a line segment, you can use a compass and straightedge. By drawing arcs from both endpoints of the segment with the same radius, the intersection points of the arcs can be connected to form the perpendicular bisector.\n\n3. **Intersection of Perpendicular Bisectors**: The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at a point called the **circumcenter**, which is equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. This point is the center of the circumcircle that can be drawn around the triangle.\n\n4. **Slope Relationship**: If you have the coordinates of the endpoints of a line segment, you can calculate the slope of the segment. The slope of the perpendicular bisector will be the negative reciprocal of this slope. If the slope of the segment is $m$, then the slope of the perpendicular bisector is $-\frac{1}{m}$.\n\n### Example:\n\nTo find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of a line segment with endpoints A(-4, 6) and B(-2, -2):\n\n1. **Find the midpoint**:\n   $$ \n   M = \left( \frac{-4 + (-2)}{2}, \frac{6 + (-2)}{2} \right) = \left( -3, 2 \right) \n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate the slope of AB**:\n   $$ \n   m_{AB} = \frac{-2 - 6}{-2 - (-4)} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \n   $$\n\n3. **Find the slope of the perpendicular bisector**:\n   $$ \n   m_{perpendicular} = -\frac{1}{-4} = \frac{1}{4} \n   $$\n\n4. **Use point-slope form to find the equation**:\n   $$ \n   y - 2 = \frac{1}{4}(x + 3) \n   $$\n\n   Simplifying this gives the equation of the perpendicular bisector.\n\nIn summary, the perpendicular bisector is a fundamental concept in geometry with important properties and applications, particularly in triangle constructions and coordinate geometry.
