answer: >-
    To solve a recursive formula, let's consider an example involving a linear recurrence relation. We will define a sequence using a recursive formula and then find the first few terms of that sequence.\n\n### Example: Solving a Recursive Formula\n\nLet's define a sequence $ a_n $ using the recursive formula:\n\n$$\na_n = 2a_{n-1} + 3\n$$\n\nwith the initial condition:\n\n$$\na_1 = 4\n$$\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the First Few Terms\n\nUsing the recursive formula, we can calculate the first few terms of the sequence:\n\n1. **First term**: \n   $$\n   a_1 = 4\n   $$\n\n2. **Second term**: \n   $$\n   a_2 = 2a_1 + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11\n   $$\n\n3. **Third term**: \n   $$\n   a_3 = 2a_2 + 3 = 2(11) + 3 = 22 + 3 = 25\n   $$\n\n4. **Fourth term**: \n   $$\n   a_4 = 2a_3 + 3 = 2(25) + 3 = 50 + 3 = 53\n   $$\n\n#### Summary of the Sequence\n\nThe first four terms of the sequence defined by the recursive formula $ a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 3 $ with $ a_1 = 4 $ are:\n\n- $ a_1 = 4 $\n- $ a_2 = 11 $\n- $ a_3 = 25 $\n- $ a_4 = 53 $\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis example illustrates how to solve a recursive formula by calculating the terms step-by-step using the defined relationship. Recursive formulas are powerful tools in mathematics for defining sequences where each term is dependent on one or more previous terms.
