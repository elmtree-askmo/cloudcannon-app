answer: >-
    To combine like radicals and simplify complex expressions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Like Radicals**: Like radicals are those that have the same index and radicand. For example, $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ 3\sqrt{2} $ are like radicals, while $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ \sqrt{3} $ are not.\n\n2. **Simplify Each Radical**: Before combining, simplify each radical expression if possible. For instance, $ \sqrt{12} $ can be simplified to $ 2\sqrt{3} $ because $ \sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} $.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**: Once you have simplified the radicals, group the like radicals together and add or subtract their coefficients. For example, if you have $ 2\sqrt{12} + \sqrt{27} $, first simplify:\n   - $ 2\sqrt{12} = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} $\n   - $ \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} $\n\n   Now, combine:\n   $$ \n   4\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{3} = (4 + 3)\sqrt{3} = 7\sqrt{3} \n   $$\n\n4. **Write the Final Expression**: After combining, write the final simplified expression. If there are any unlike radicals remaining, they should be left in their original form.\n\n### Example\nLet's simplify the expression $ \sqrt{8} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{18} + 3\sqrt{2} $:\n\n1. **Simplify Each Radical**:\n   - $ \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} $\n   - $ \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} $\n\n2. **Rewrite the Expression**:\n   $$ \n   2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} \n   $$\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine $ 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2} $\n   - Combine $ -3\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} = 0 $\n\n   Thus, the final simplified expression is:\n   $$ \n   4\sqrt{2} \n   $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively combine like radicals and simplify complex expressions.
