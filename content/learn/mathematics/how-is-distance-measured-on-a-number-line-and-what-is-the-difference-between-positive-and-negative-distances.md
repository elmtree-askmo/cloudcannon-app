    How is distance measured on a number line, and what is the difference between positive and negative distances?
answer: >-
    Distance on a number line is measured using the concept of absolute value. The distance between two points, say $ a $ and $ b $, is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between these two points, expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\text{Distance} = |a - b|\n$$\n\nThis formula ensures that the distance is always a non-negative value, as distance cannot be negative. For example, if we want to find the distance between the points 4 and -4 on the number line, we calculate it as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{Distance} = |4 - (-4)| = |4 + 4| = |8| = 8 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Positive vs. Negative Distances\n\nThe concept of positive and negative distances can be a bit misleading. In the context of distance measurement on a number line, the distance itself is always a positive value due to the use of absolute value. However, the positions of the points can be positive or negative:\n\n- **Positive Distance**: This is the actual measurement of how far apart two points are, regardless of their positions on the number line. For instance, the distance between 5 and 11 is calculated as $ |11 - 5| = 6 $ units.\n  \n- **Negative Values**: When we refer to negative numbers on the number line, we are simply indicating their position relative to zero. For example, -3 is 3 units away from zero, and its absolute value is $ |-3| = 3 $. However, when calculating distance, we always convert these values to their positive counterparts.\n\nIn summary, while the numbers themselves can be positive or negative, the distance measured between any two points on a number line is always expressed as a positive value, reflecting the absolute difference between them.
