    Set builder notation and interval notation are two methods for describing sets in mathematics, particularly for domains and ranges of functions. Set builder notation describes members by their properties, while interval notation specifies ranges of values on the real number line.

    What is set builder notation and how does it compare to interval notation?
answer: >-
    Set builder notation and interval notation are two different ways to describe sets of numbers, particularly useful in mathematics for expressing domains and ranges of functions.\n\n### Set Builder Notation\nSet builder notation is a concise way to specify a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. It is written in the form:\n\n$$\n\{ x \,|\, \text{property of } x \}\n$$\n\nFor example, the set of all real numbers $ x $ such that $ x > 0 $ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\{ x \,|\, x > 0 \}\n$$\n\nThis notation is particularly useful when the set is defined by specific conditions or rules, allowing for a clear and precise description of the elements that belong to the set.\n\n### Interval Notation\nInterval notation, on the other hand, is used to represent a range of values on the real number line. It employs parentheses and brackets to indicate whether the endpoints are included or excluded. For example:\n\n- The interval $ (2, 5] $ represents all numbers greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5. Here, the parenthesis indicates that 2 is not included, while the bracket indicates that 5 is included.\n\n### Comparison\n1. **Format**: \n   - Set builder notation focuses on the properties of the elements, while interval notation focuses on the range of values.\n   \n2. **Use Cases**: \n   - Set builder notation is often used when the criteria for membership are complex or when dealing with conditions that cannot be easily expressed as a simple range. \n   - Interval notation is typically used for continuous ranges of numbers, making it more straightforward for expressing domains and ranges of functions that are intervals.\n\n3. **Examples**:\n   - The domain of the function \( g(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \) can be expressed in set builder notation as:\n     $$\n     \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \,|\, x \neq 1 \text{ and } x \neq -1 \}\n     $$\n   - In interval notation, the same domain can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     (-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, 1) \cup (1, \infty)\n     $$\n\nIn summary, both notations serve important roles in mathematics, and the choice between them often depends on the context and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
