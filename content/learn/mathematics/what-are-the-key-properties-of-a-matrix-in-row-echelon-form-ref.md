    Key properties of row echelon form (REF) of a matrix include non-zero rows above zero rows, positioning of leading entries to the right of the above row, zero entries below leading entries, and the definition of leading entries as the first non-zero elements in their respective rows.

    What are the key properties of a matrix in row echelon form (REF)?
answer: >-
    The key properties of a matrix in row echelon form (REF) are as follows:\n\n1. **Non-zero Rows Above Zero Rows**: All non-zero rows of the matrix are positioned above any rows that consist entirely of zeros. This means that if there are any rows that do not contain any non-zero elements, they will be at the bottom of the matrix.\n\n2. **Leading Entry (Pivot) Positioning**: The leading entry (also known as a pivot) of each non-zero row must be to the right of the leading entry of the row directly above it. This creates a staircase pattern in the matrix, where each leading entry moves further to the right as you move down the rows.\n\n3. **Zero Entries Below Leading Entries**: All entries below each leading entry in a column must be zero. This ensures that the leading entries are the first non-zero elements in their respective rows and that they contribute to the triangular structure of the matrix.\n\n4. **Leading Entry Definition**: The leading entry is defined as the first non-zero element in a row. It is crucial for determining the row echelon form and is used to identify pivot positions.\n\nAn example of a matrix in row echelon form is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 4 \\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nIn this example, you can see that:\n- All non-zero rows are above the zero rows (if any).\n- The leading entries (1s) are positioned in a way that each is to the right of the leading entry in the row above.\n- All entries below each leading entry are zero.\n\nThese properties are essential for performing operations such as solving systems of linear equations and for transforming matrices into reduced row echelon form (RREF) if further simplification is needed.
