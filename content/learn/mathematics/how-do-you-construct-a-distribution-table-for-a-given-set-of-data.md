    How do you construct a distribution table for a given set of data?
answer: >-
    To construct a distribution table for a given set of data, you can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Organize the Data\nStart by arranging your raw data in ascending order. This helps in identifying the frequency of each value or range of values.\n\n### 2. Create a Frequency Distribution Table\nA frequency distribution table summarizes how often each value occurs in your dataset. You can create this table in two ways: using individual values or grouping them into intervals (bins).\n\n#### Example of Individual Values:\nFor a dataset of marks: \n```\n68, 68, 72, 72, 75, 75, 78, 78, 80, 80, 82, 82, 85, 85, 88, 88, 90, 90, 92, 92\n```\nYou would create a table like this:\n\n| Marks | Frequency |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 68    | 2         |\n| 72    | 2         |\n| 75    | 2         |\n| 78    | 2         |\n| 80    | 2         |\n| 82    | 2         |\n| 85    | 2         |\n| 88    | 2         |\n| 90    | 2         |\n| 92    | 2         |\n\n#### Example of Grouped Data:\nIf you have continuous data, you might want to group it into intervals. For example:\n\n| Class Intervals | Frequency |\n|-----------------|-----------|\n| 10-20           | 3         |\n| 20-30           | 7         |\n| 30-40           | 12        |\n| 40-50           | 5         |\n| 50-60           | 8         |\n\n### 3. Calculate Cumulative Frequency\nCumulative frequency is the running total of frequencies. It helps in understanding the distribution of data over intervals.\n\n| Marks | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |\n|-------|-----------|----------------------|\n| 68    | 2         | 2                    |\n| 72    | 2         | 4                    |\n| 75    | 2         | 6                    |\n| 78    | 2         | 8                    |\n| 80    | 2         | 10                   |\n| 82    | 2         | 12                   |\n| 85    | 2         | 14                   |\n| 88    | 2         | 16                   |\n| 90    | 2         | 18                   |\n| 92    | 2         | 20                   |\n\n### 4. Calculate Relative Frequency\nRelative frequency shows the proportion of the total for each value or interval. It can be expressed as a percentage.\n\nFor example, if the total number of observations is 20, the relative frequency for the mark 68 would be calculated as:\n$$\n\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Total Observations}} \times 100 = \frac{2}{20} \times 100 = 10\%\n$$\n\n### 5. Present the Data\nFinally, you can present your frequency distribution table, including frequency, cumulative frequency, and relative frequency, to provide a comprehensive view of your data.\n\n### Conclusion\nConstructing a distribution table is a systematic way to organize and analyze data, making it easier to interpret and draw conclusions from the dataset.
