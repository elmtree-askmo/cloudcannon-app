    Describe the basic steps for graphing a quadratic function.
answer: >-
    To graph a quadratic function in standard form, follow these basic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Standard Form**: Ensure the quadratic function is in the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, where $ a \neq 0 $.\n\n2. **Find the Vertex**:\n   - Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n     $$ \n     x = -\frac{b}{2a} \n     $$\n   - Substitute this x-value back into the quadratic equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate. The vertex is thus given by the point \((x, y)\).\n\n3. **Determine the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, given by the equation:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n\n4. **Plot the Vertex**: Mark the vertex on the graph.\n\n5. **Choose Additional Points**: Select x-values on either side of the axis of symmetry to find additional points on the parabola. Calculate the corresponding y-values by substituting these x-values into the quadratic equation.\n\n6. **Plot Additional Points**: Mark these additional points on the graph.\n\n7. **Draw the Parabola**: Connect the points with a smooth curve to form the parabola. Ensure that the curve opens upwards if $ a > 0 $ and downwards if $ a < 0 $.\n\n8. **Label Key Features**: Optionally, label the vertex, axis of symmetry, and any intercepts for clarity.\n\nFor example, consider the quadratic function $ y = x^2 - 4x + 3 $:\n- The coefficients are $ a = 1 $, $ b = -4 $, and $ c = 3 $.\n- The vertex can be calculated as follows:\n  $$\n  x = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 1} = 2\n  $$\n  Substituting $ x = 2 $ into the equation gives:\n  $$\n  y = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1\n  $$\n  Thus, the vertex is at \((2, -1)\).\n- The axis of symmetry is $ x = 2 $.\n- Additional points can be calculated for $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 3 $ to find corresponding y-values, and then plot these points to complete the graph.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph any quadratic function in standard form.
