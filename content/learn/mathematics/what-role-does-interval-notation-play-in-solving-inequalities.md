    What role does interval notation play in solving inequalities?
answer: >-
    Interval notation plays a crucial role in solving inequalities by providing a concise and clear way to express the solution sets of these inequalities. Here are some key points regarding its significance:\n\n1. **Conciseness**: Interval notation allows for a compact representation of the solution sets. For example, the inequality \(x \geq 4\) can be expressed in interval notation as \([4, \infty)\), which succinctly indicates that \(x\) includes 4 and all numbers greater than 4.\n\n2. **Inclusivity and Exclusivity**: Interval notation uses brackets and parentheses to denote whether endpoints are included or excluded. A square bracket \([ ]\) indicates that the endpoint is included (closed interval), while a parenthesis \(( )\) indicates that it is excluded (open interval). For instance, the interval \((-1, 6]\) represents all numbers greater than -1 and up to and including 6.\n\n3. **Compound Inequalities**: Interval notation is particularly useful for expressing compound inequalities. For example, the compound inequality \(x < -2\) or \(x \geq 1\) can be represented as the union of intervals: \((-\infty, -2) \cup [1, \infty)\). This clearly shows that the solution includes all numbers less than -2 and all numbers greater than or equal to 1.\n\n4. **Graphical Representation**: Interval notation corresponds well with graphical representations of inequalities on a number line. Each interval can be visually represented, making it easier to understand the range of solutions.\n\n5. **Solving Process**: When solving inequalities, converting the solution to interval notation is often a final step. This requires identifying the bounds of the inequality, determining inclusivity based on the inequality symbols, and then writing the interval from left to right. For example, for the inequality \(-1 < x \leq 6\), the interval notation would be \((-1, 6]\).\n\nIn summary, interval notation is an essential tool in the study of inequalities, providing a clear, efficient, and standardized way to express the solutions to various types of inequalities.
