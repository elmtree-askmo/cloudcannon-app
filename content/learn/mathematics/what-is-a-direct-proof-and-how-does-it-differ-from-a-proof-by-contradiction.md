    What is a direct proof, and how does it differ from a proof by contradiction?
answer: >-
    A direct proof is a method of demonstrating the truth of a mathematical statement by using a straightforward sequence of logical deductions based on established facts, axioms, and previously proven theorems. In a direct proof, one typically starts with the premises of the statement and applies logical reasoning to arrive at the conclusion. For example, to prove a statement of the form "If $ p $, then $ q $", one assumes $ p $ is true and then shows that $ q $ must also be true through a series of logical steps.\n\nIn contrast, a proof by contradiction (also known as reductio ad absurdum) begins by assuming that the statement to be proven is false. From this assumption, the proof proceeds to derive a contradiction, which implies that the original assumption must be incorrect. Therefore, the statement must be true. This method is particularly useful when a direct approach is difficult or when the statement involves negations.\n\nTo summarize the differences:\n- **Direct Proof**: Assumes the premises are true and logically deduces the conclusion directly.\n- **Proof by Contradiction**: Assumes the negation of the conclusion is true, derives a contradiction, and concludes that the original statement must be true.\n\nBoth methods are valid and widely used in mathematical proofs, but they serve different purposes and can be more effective in different contexts.
