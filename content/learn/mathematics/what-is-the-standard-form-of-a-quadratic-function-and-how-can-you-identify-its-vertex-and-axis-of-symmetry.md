    What is the standard form of a quadratic function, and how can you identify its vertex and axis of symmetry?
answer: >-
    The standard form of a quadratic function is expressed as:\n\n$$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere $ a \neq 0 $. In this form, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants, and the graph of the function is a parabola.\n\n### Identifying the Vertex\n\nTo find the vertex of a quadratic function in standard form, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex** using the formula:\n\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n\n2. **Substitute the x-coordinate back into the original equation** to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n   $$\n   y = a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) + c\n   $$\n\n   This will give you the vertex \((h, k)\), where $ h = -\frac{b}{2a} $ and $ k $ is the corresponding y-value.\n\n### Axis of Symmetry\n\nThe axis of symmetry for a quadratic function is a vertical line that passes through the vertex. It can be expressed with the equation:\n\n$$\nx = -\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Standard Form:** $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $\n- **Vertex:** \((h, k)\) where $ h = -\frac{b}{2a} $ and $ k $ is found by substituting $ h $ back into the function.\n- **Axis of Symmetry:** $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively identify the vertex and axis of symmetry for any quadratic function presented in standard form.
