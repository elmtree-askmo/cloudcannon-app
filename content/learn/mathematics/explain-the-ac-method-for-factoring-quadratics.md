    The AC method is a systematic approach to factoring quadratic trinomials of the form ax^2 + bx + c, particularly useful when the leading coefficient a is not equal to 1. It involves identifying coefficients, calculating the product ac, finding integers that add to b and multiply to ac, rewriting the quadratic, and factoring by grouping.

answer: >-
    The AC method is a systematic approach for factoring quadratic trinomials of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. This method is particularly useful when the leading coefficient $a$ is not equal to 1. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the AC method:\n\n1. **Identify $a$, $b$, and $c$**: Start with the quadratic in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$. Identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n2. **Calculate $ac$**: Multiply the leading coefficient $a$ by the constant term $c$. This product is denoted as $ac$.\n\n3. **Find two numbers**: Look for two integers that multiply to $ac$ and add up to $b$. These two numbers will help in rewriting the middle term of the quadratic.\n\n4. **Rewrite the quadratic**: Use the two numbers found in the previous step to split the middle term $bx$ into two terms. This will give you a four-term polynomial.\n\n5. **Factor by grouping**: Group the terms in pairs and factor out the common factors from each pair.\n\n6. **Final factorization**: If done correctly, you should be able to factor the expression into the form \((px + q)(rx + s)\).\n\n### Example\nLet's apply the AC method to the quadratic $2x^2 + x - 6$:\n\n1. Identify $a = 2$, $b = 1$, and $c = -6$.\n2. Calculate \(ac = 2 \cdot (-6) = -12\).\n3. Find two numbers that multiply to $-12$ and add to $1$. The numbers $4$ and $-3$ work because \(4 \cdot (-3) = -12\) and \(4 + (-3) = 1\).\n4. Rewrite the quadratic: \n   $$2x^2 + 4x - 3x - 6$$\n5. Factor by grouping:\n   - Group the first two terms: $2x^2 + 4x$ gives \(2x(x + 2)\).\n   - Group the last two terms: $-3x - 6$ gives \(-3(x + 2)\).\n   - Now combine: \n   $$2x(x + 2) - 3(x + 2) = (2x - 3)(x + 2)$$\n6. The final factorization is:\n   $$(2x - 3)(x + 2)$$\n\nThis method is effective for a wide range of quadratic equations and helps streamline the factoring process, especially when the leading coefficient is greater than 1.
