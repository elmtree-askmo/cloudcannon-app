    How do you maintain proportions when adjusting the dimensions of a rectangle?
answer: >-
    To maintain proportions when adjusting the dimensions of a rectangle, you can follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Constrain Proportions**: When resizing a rectangle, enable the "Constrain Proportions" option. This ensures that the height and width maintain their original ratio, preventing distortion. When this option is enabled, dragging a corner handle will resize the rectangle while keeping the aspect ratio intact.\n\n2. **Aspect Ratio**: The aspect ratio of a rectangle is defined as the ratio of its width to its height. For example, if a rectangle has a width of 4 units and a height of 3 units, its aspect ratio is 4:3. To maintain this ratio while resizing, you can use the formula:\n   $$ \n   \text{Aspect Ratio} = \frac{w}{h} \n   $$\n   where $ w $ is the width and $ h $ is the height.\n\n3. **Scaling Dimensions**: If you want to resize a rectangle while keeping the same proportions, you can multiply both the width and height by the same scaling factor. For example, if you have a rectangle with dimensions $ w_1 $ and $ h_1 $, and you want to scale it by a factor of $ k $, the new dimensions $ w_2 $ and $ h_2 $ will be:\n   $$\n   w_2 = k \cdot w_1 \\\n   h_2 = k \cdot h_1\n   $$\n\n4. **Area Considerations**: If you want to resize a rectangle to achieve a specific area while maintaining the aspect ratio, you can derive the new dimensions based on the desired area. For example, if you want to reduce the area of a rectangle $ A_1 = w_1 \times h_1 $ by 50%, the new area $ A_2 $ will be:\n   $$\n   A_2 = 0.5 \times A_1\n   $$\n   To find the new dimensions $ w_2 $ and $ h_2 $ that maintain the aspect ratio, you can set up the equations:\n   $$\n   w_2 = k \cdot w_1 \\\n   h_2 = k \cdot h_1\n   $$\n   and solve for $ k $ using the area equation:\n   $$\n   A_2 = w_2 \times h_2 = (k \cdot w_1) \times (k \cdot h_1) = k^2 \cdot A_1\n   $$\n   From this, you can find $ k $ and subsequently $ w_2 $ and $ h_2 $.\n\n5. **Practical Application**: In design software, you can often hold down a specific key (like the Shift key) while dragging a corner handle to maintain proportions. This is a common feature in graphic design and CAD software.\n\nBy following these principles, you can effectively maintain the proportions of a rectangle while adjusting its dimensions.
