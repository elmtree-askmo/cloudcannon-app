answer: >-
    The multiplication of powers can be explained in simple terms using the basic rules of exponents. When you multiply two powers that have the same base, you simply add their exponents. This is known as the product of powers rule.\n\nFor example, if you have $2^3$ and $2^4$, you can multiply them as follows:\n\n$$\n2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7\n$$\n\nThis means that $2^3$ (which is $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$) multiplied by $2^4$ (which is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$) equals $2^7$ (which is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 128$).\n\nIn summary, the key point to remember is that when multiplying powers with the same base, you add the exponents together. This rule simplifies calculations and makes it easier to work with large numbers in algebra.
