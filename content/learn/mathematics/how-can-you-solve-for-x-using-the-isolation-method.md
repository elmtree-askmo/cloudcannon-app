    How can you solve for X using the isolation method?
answer: >-
    To solve for $ x $ using the isolation method, you will follow a systematic approach to manipulate the equation until $ x $ is by itself on one side. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using the example equation $ 4x + 2 = 10 $:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: Start with the equation you want to solve. In this case, it's $ 4x + 2 = 10 $.\n\n2. **Isolate the variable term**: To isolate the term containing $ x $, you need to eliminate any constants on the same side. You can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides:\n   $$\n   4x + 2 - 2 = 10 - 2\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   4x = 8\n   $$\n\n3. **Use inverse operations**: Now, to isolate $ x $, you need to eliminate the coefficient of $ x $. Since $ x $ is multiplied by 4, you will divide both sides by 4:\n   $$\n   \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{8}{4}\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   x = 2\n   $$\n\n4. **Check your work**: It's always a good practice to substitute the value of $ x $ back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation:\n   $$\n   4(2) + 2 = 10 \\\n   8 + 2 = 10 \\\n   10 = 10\n   $$\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution $ x = 2 $ is correct.\n\n### Additional Tips for Isolating $ x $:\n- **Balance the equation**: Whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must perform on the other side to maintain equality.\n- **Use inverse operations**: If $ x $ is added to a number, subtract that number; if $ x $ is multiplied by a number, divide by that number.\n- **Combine like terms**: If there are multiple terms involving $ x $, combine them before isolating $ x $ to simplify the process.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you can effectively isolate and solve for $ x $ in various algebraic equations.
