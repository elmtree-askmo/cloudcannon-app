    What are cylindrical coordinates and how do they relate to rectangular coordinates?
answer: >-
    Cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional coordinate system that extends the concept of polar coordinates by adding a height (z) axis. A point in cylindrical coordinates is represented as an ordered triple \((r, \theta, z)\), where:\n\n- $r$ is the radial distance from a chosen reference axis (usually the z-axis),\n- $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle measured from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane,\n- $z$ is the height above the xy-plane, corresponding to the usual z-coordinate in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThis system allows for a more convenient representation of points in scenarios involving cylindrical symmetry, such as in problems related to cylinders.\n\nTo relate cylindrical coordinates to rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, the following conversion formulas are used:\n\n$$\n\begin{aligned}\nx &= r \cos \theta, \\\ny &= r \sin \theta, \\\nz &= z.\n\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nConversely, to convert from rectangular coordinates \((x, y, z)\) to cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), the formulas are:\n\n$$\n\begin{aligned}\nr &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\\n\theta &= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right), \\\nz &= z.\n\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis relationship highlights how cylindrical coordinates can be viewed as a generalization of polar coordinates into three dimensions, making them particularly useful in various applications in physics and engineering, especially when dealing with cylindrical objects or systems.
