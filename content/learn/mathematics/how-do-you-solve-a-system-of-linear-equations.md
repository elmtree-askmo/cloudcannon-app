    How do you solve a system of linear equations?
answer: >-
    To solve a system of linear equations, there are several methods you can use, including substitution, elimination, and graphing. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each method:\n\n### 1. Substitution Method\nThis method involves solving one of the equations for one variable and then substituting that expression into the other equation.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Solve one of the equations for one variable (e.g., $y$ in terms of $x$).\n- Substitute this expression into the other equation.\n- Solve for the remaining variable.\n- Substitute back to find the other variable.\n\n**Example:**\nGiven the system:\n$$\n\begin{align*}\nx + 2y &= 8 \quad (1) \\\n3x - y &= 5 \quad (2)\n\end{align*}\n$$\nFrom equation (1), solve for $y$:\n$$\ny = \frac{8 - x}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting into equation (2):\n$$\n3x - \left(\frac{8 - x}{2}\right) = 5\n$$\nNow solve for $x$ and then substitute back to find $y$.\n\n### 2. Elimination Method\nThis method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve for the other.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Align the equations.\n- Multiply one or both equations by a number to make the coefficients of one variable the same.\n- Add or subtract the equations to eliminate that variable.\n- Solve for the remaining variable.\n- Substitute back to find the other variable.\n\n**Example:**\nUsing the same system:\n$$\n\begin{align*}\nx + 2y &= 8 \quad (1) \\\n3x - y &= 5 \quad (2)\n\end{align*}\n$$\nMultiply equation (1) by 3:\n$$\n3x + 6y = 24 \quad (3)\n$$\nNow subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n$$\n(3x + 6y) - (3x - y) = 24 - 5\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n7y = 19 \implies y = \frac{19}{7}\n$$\nSubstituting back to find $x$.\n\n### 3. Graphing Method\nThis method involves graphing both equations on the same set of axes and identifying the point of intersection, which represents the solution.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form (if necessary).\n- Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane.\n- Identify the point where the two lines intersect.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the equations:\n$$\ny = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4 \quad (1) \\\ny = 3x - 5 \quad (2)\n$$\nGraph both lines and find the intersection point.\n\n### Conclusion\nEach method has its advantages depending on the specific system of equations you are dealing with. The substitution method is often easier for systems where one equation can be easily solved for one variable. The elimination method is useful when the coefficients are conducive to elimination. The graphing method provides a visual representation but may be less precise for complex systems. \n\nBy using these methods, you can effectively solve systems of linear equations and find the values of the variables involved.
