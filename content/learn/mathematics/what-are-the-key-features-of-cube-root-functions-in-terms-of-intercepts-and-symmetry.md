    What are the key features of cube root functions in terms of intercepts and symmetry?
answer: >-
    The key features of cube root functions, particularly in terms of intercepts and symmetry, are as follows:\n\n### Intercepts\n1. **Y-Intercept**: The cube root function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) has a y-intercept at the origin (0, 0). This is because when $ x = 0 $, \( f(0) = \sqrt[3]{0} = 0 \).\n2. **X-Intercept**: Similarly, the x-intercept is also at the origin (0, 0). The function crosses the x-axis at this point, indicating that it has a root at $ x = 0 $.\n\n### Symmetry\n1. **Odd Function**: The cube root function is symmetric about the origin, which means it is an odd function. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n   $$ \n   f(-x) = -f(x) \n   $$\n   For example, if $ x = 1 $, then \( f(1) = 1 \) and \( f(-1) = -1 \). This symmetry indicates that the graph of the function will reflect across the origin.\n\n### Additional Characteristics\n- **Continuous and Smooth**: The graph of the cube root function is continuous and smooth, extending infinitely in both the positive and negative directions. There are no breaks, holes, or asymptotes in the graph.\n- **No Maximum or Minimum**: The cube root function does not have any maximum or minimum values; it continues to rise and fall without bound.\n\n### Graphing\nWhen graphing the cube root function, it is helpful to plot points corresponding to perfect cubes, such as:\n- \( (-8, -2) \)\n- \( (-1, -1) \)\n- \( (0, 0) \)\n- \( (1, 1) \)\n- \( (8, 2) \)\n\nThese points help illustrate the characteristic shape of the graph, which passes through the origin and extends into all four quadrants.\n\nIn summary, the cube root function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) has a y-intercept and x-intercept at the origin, exhibits symmetry about the origin, and is continuous and smooth across its entire domain of all real numbers.
