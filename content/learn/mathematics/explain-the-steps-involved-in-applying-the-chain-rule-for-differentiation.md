    Explain the steps involved in applying the chain rule for differentiation.
answer: >-
    The chain rule is a fundamental technique in calculus used to differentiate composite functions, which are functions formed by the composition of two or more functions. Here are the steps involved in applying the chain rule for differentiation:\n\n1. **Identify the Inner and Outer Functions**: \n   - Determine which function is the inner function (the one inside) and which is the outer function (the one outside). For example, in the function \( f(x) = (g(x))^n \), \( g(x) \) is the inner function and \( (u)^n \) is the outer function where \( u = g(x) \).\n\n2. **Differentiate the Outer Function**: \n   - Differentiate the outer function while keeping the inner function unchanged. For instance, if the outer function is $ u^n $, its derivative is $ n \cdot u^{n-1} $.\n\n3. **Differentiate the Inner Function**: \n   - Next, differentiate the inner function. For example, if the inner function is \( g(x) \), find \( g'(x) \).\n\n4. **Multiply the Derivatives**: \n   - Multiply the derivative of the outer function (from step 2) by the derivative of the inner function (from step 3). This gives you the derivative of the composite function.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: \n   - Write the final result as a product of the derivatives obtained in the previous steps.\n\n### Example\nLet's apply the chain rule to differentiate the function \( f(x) = (4x - 3)^5 \):\n\n1. **Identify Functions**:\n   - Inner function: \( g(x) = 4x - 3 \)\n   - Outer function: $ u^5 $ where \( u = g(x) \)\n\n2. **Differentiate the Outer Function**:\n   - The derivative of $ u^5 $ is $ 5u^4 $.\n\n3. **Differentiate the Inner Function**:\n   - The derivative of \( g(x) = 4x - 3 \) is \( g'(x) = 4 \).\n\n4. **Multiply the Derivatives**:\n   - Combine the results: \n   $$ \n   f'(x) = 5(4x - 3)^4 \cdot 4 \n   $$\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - Thus, the derivative is:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 20(4x - 3)^4\n   $$\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- **Forgetting to Apply the Chain Rule**: Always check if the function is a composition of functions.\n- **Misidentifying Inner and Outer Functions**: Clearly define which function is which before differentiating.\n- **Neglecting to Multiply by the Derivative of the Inner Function**: This is a crucial step in the chain rule.\n\nBy following these steps and being mindful of common pitfalls, you can effectively apply the chain rule to differentiate a wide variety of composite functions in calculus.
