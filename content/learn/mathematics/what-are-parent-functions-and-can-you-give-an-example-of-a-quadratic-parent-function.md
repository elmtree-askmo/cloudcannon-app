    What are parent functions, and can you give an example of a quadratic parent function?
answer: >-
    Parent functions are the simplest forms of functions within a family of functions. They serve as the foundational building blocks from which more complex functions can be derived through various transformations, such as translations, reflections, and dilations. Understanding parent functions is essential for analyzing how these transformations affect the shape and position of their graphs.\n\nAn example of a quadratic parent function is:\n\n$$\nf(x) = x^2\n$$\n\nThis function represents a parabola that opens upward. The graph of this parent function is U-shaped, and it serves as the basis for all quadratic functions, which can be expressed in the general form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The value of $a$ determines the direction in which the parabola opens (upward if $a > 0$ and downward if $a < 0$), while $b$ and $c$ affect the position of the graph on the coordinate plane.\n\nIn summary, the quadratic parent function \(f(x) = x^2\) is fundamental in understanding the characteristics and transformations of all quadratic functions.
