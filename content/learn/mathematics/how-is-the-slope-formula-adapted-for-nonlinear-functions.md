    How is the slope formula adapted for non-linear functions?
answer: >-
    The slope formula for non-linear functions is adapted by using the concept of the average rate of change, as the slope can vary depending on the interval chosen. For linear functions, the slope is constant and can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\n$$\n\nHowever, for non-linear functions, this formula is used to find the average rate of change over a specific interval, which provides an approximation of the slope between two points on the curve. \n\nFor example, consider the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2\). To find the average rate of change between $x = 1$ and $x = 3$, we calculate:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4.\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the average slope between these two points is 4. However, if we were to calculate the average rate of change over different intervals, such as between $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ or between $x = 2$ and $x = 3$, we would find different values, reflecting the non-linear nature of the function.\n\nIn summary, while the basic slope formula remains the same, for non-linear functions, we often refer to the average rate of change over an interval to understand how the slope behaves, as it can change significantly depending on the points chosen. This adaptation is crucial for analyzing the behavior of various types of non-linear functions, including quadratic, exponential, and piecewise functions.
