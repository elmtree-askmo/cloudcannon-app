    To find the limits of a function as it approaches an asymptote, you can follow these steps, particularly focusing on horizontal and vertical asymptotes:\n\n### Horizontal Asymptotes\n1. **Definition**: A horizontal asymptote is a line \(y = k\) where the function \(f(x)\) approaches \(k\) as \(x\) approaches infinity or negative infinity. This is expressed mathematically as:\n   - \( \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = k \)\n   - \( \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = k \)\n\n2. **Finding Horizontal Asymptotes**:\n   - For rational functions, compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator:\n     - If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\).\n     - If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = \frac{a}{b}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, respectively.\n     - If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (the function may have an oblique asymptote instead).\n\n3. **Example**: For the function \(f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 4}\):\n   - The degrees of the numerator and denominator are both 2. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is:\n     $$\n     y = \frac{1}{1} = 1\n     $$\n   - To confirm, compute the limit:\n     $$\n     \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 4} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{1 + \frac{4}{x^2}} = 1\n     $$\n\n### Vertical Asymptotes\n1. **Definition**: A vertical asymptote occurs at \(x = c\) if \(f(x)\) approaches infinity (or negative infinity) as \(x\) approaches \(c\). This is expressed as:\n   - \( \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) = \infty \) or \( \lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = -\infty \)\n\n2. **Finding Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - Identify values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero (and the numerator non-zero).\n   - Compute the one-sided limits to confirm the behavior of the function as it approaches these values.\n\n3. **Example**: For the function \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 - x}{x^2 - 6x + 5}\):\n   - Factor the denominator: \(x^2 - 6x + 5 = (x - 1)(x - 5)\). The vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 1\) and \(x = 5\).\n   - Check the limits:\n     - For \(x = 1\):\n       $$\n       \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = \infty \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = -\infty\n       $$\n     - For \(x = 5\):\n       $$\n       \lim_{x \to 5^+} f(x) = -\infty \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x \to 5^-} f(x) = \infty\n       $$\n\n### Conclusion\nBy evaluating these limits, you can effectively determine the behavior of a function as it approaches its asymptotes. This analysis is crucial for sketching the graph of the function and understanding its overall behavior.
