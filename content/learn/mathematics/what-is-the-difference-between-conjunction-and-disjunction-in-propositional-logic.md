    What is the difference between conjunction and disjunction in propositional logic?
answer: >-
    In propositional logic, conjunction and disjunction are two fundamental logical operators that combine propositions in different ways.\n\n### Conjunction (∧)\n- **Definition**: The conjunction operator, denoted by the symbol ∧, combines two propositions and results in true only if both propositions are true.\n- **Truth Table**:\n  | A     | B     | A ∧ B |\n  |-------|-------|-------|\n  | True  | True  | True  |\n  | True  | False | False |\n  | False | True  | False |\n  | False | False | False |\n\n- **Example**: If we have two propositions, "It is raining" (A) and "It is cold" (B), the conjunction "It is raining and it is cold" (A ∧ B) is true only when both A and B are true.\n\n### Disjunction (∨)\n- **Definition**: The disjunction operator, denoted by the symbol ∨, combines two propositions and results in true if at least one of the propositions is true.\n- **Truth Table**:\n  | A     | B     | A ∨ B |\n  |-------|-------|-------|\n  | True  | True  | True  |\n  | True  | False | True  |\n  | False | True  | True  |\n  | False | False | False |\n\n- **Example**: Using the same propositions, "It is raining" (A) and "It is cold" (B), the disjunction "It is raining or it is cold" (A ∨ B) is true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Truth Conditions**: The key difference lies in their truth conditions:\n  - Conjunction (A ∧ B) is true only when both A and B are true.\n  - Disjunction (A ∨ B) is true when at least one of A or B is true.\n  \n- **Logical Interpretation**: Conjunction represents a logical "and," while disjunction represents a logical "or." \n\nUnderstanding these operators is crucial for constructing logical expressions and analyzing their truth values in propositional logic.
