    How are trigonometric functions of an acute angle defined?
answer: >-
    Trigonometric functions of an acute angle are defined using the relationships between the angles and sides of a right triangle. In a right triangle, one of the angles is a right angle (90 degrees), and the other two angles are acute angles (less than 90 degrees). The six primary trigonometric functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), cotangent (cot), secant (sec), and cosecant (csc). \n\nFor an acute angle $A$ in a right triangle, the definitions of the trigonometric functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Sine**: \n   $$ \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n\n2. **Cosine**: \n   $$ \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n\n3. **Tangent**: \n   $$ \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}} $$\n\n4. **Cotangent**: \n   $$ \cot A = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{opposite side}} $$\n\n5. **Secant**: \n   $$ \sec A = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent side}} $$\n\n6. **Cosecant**: \n   $$ \csc A = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite side}} $$\n\nThese functions can also be understood in the context of the unit circle, where an angle $θ$ is represented by a point \(P=(x,y)\) on the circle. For acute angles, the values of the trigonometric functions correspond to the coordinates of this point:\n\n- $ \sin θ = y $\n- $ \cos θ = x $\n- $ \tan θ = \frac{y}{x} $ (where $x \neq 0$)\n\nThis dual definition allows for a comprehensive understanding of trigonometric functions, extending their application beyond right triangles to any angle in standard position.
