    Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a composite number into its prime factors, which are the prime numbers that multiply together to yield the original number. This technique is particularly useful in various areas of mathematics, including simplifying polynomial expressions.\n\n### Process of Prime Factorization\n\n1. **Identify the Number**: Start with the composite number you wish to factor.\n2. **Divide by the Smallest Prime**: Begin dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2, 3, 5, etc.) and continue dividing until you can no longer divide evenly.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process with the quotient obtained from the previous division until you reach 1.\n4. **List the Prime Factors**: The prime factors are the numbers you used to divide the original number.\n\n**Example**: To factor 60:\n- Divide by 2: $60 \div 2 = 30$\n- Divide by 2 again: $30 \div 2 = 15$\n- Divide by 3: $15 \div 3 = 5$\n- Finally, 5 is a prime number.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 60 is $2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$.\n\n### Application in Simplifying Polynomial Expressions\n\nPrime factorization can be applied in simplifying polynomial expressions, especially when dealing with expressions that involve radicals or when factoring polynomials.\n\n1. **Simplifying Radicals**: When simplifying expressions with square roots or other roots, prime factorization helps in breaking down the radicand (the number under the radical) into its prime factors. For example, to simplify $\sqrt{60}$:\n   - Factor 60: $60 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$\n   - Rewrite the square root: $\sqrt{60} = \sqrt{2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1}$\n   - Simplify: $\sqrt{60} = 2\sqrt{15}$\n\n2. **Factoring Polynomials**: When factoring polynomials, prime factorization can help identify common factors. For instance, if you have a polynomial like $6x^2 + 12x$:\n   - Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF), which is 6: \n   - \(6(x^2 + 2x)\)\n   - Further factor $x^2 + 2x$ if possible.\n\n3. **Identifying Roots**: In polynomial expressions, prime factorization can assist in finding the roots of the polynomial by setting the factors equal to zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding prime factorization is essential for simplifying expressions, particularly in algebra. It provides a systematic approach to breaking down numbers and expressions, making it easier to manipulate and simplify polynomial expressions effectively. By mastering this technique, students can enhance their problem-solving skills in algebra and beyond.
