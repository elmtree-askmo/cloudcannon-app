    How do you calculate the limit of a convergent sequence?
answer: >-
    To calculate the limit of a convergent sequence, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Recurrence Relation**: If the sequence is defined recursively, identify the relation that generates the terms of the sequence. For example, consider the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:\n   $$ u_{n+1} = au_n + b $$\n\n2. **Assume Convergence**: Assume that the sequence converges to a limit $ L $ as $ n \to \infty $. This means that both $ u_n $ and $ u_{n+1} $ approach $ L $.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: Substitute $ L $ into the recurrence relation:\n   $$ L = aL + b $$\n\n4. **Solve for $ L $**: Rearrange the equation to isolate $ L $:\n   $$ L - aL = b $$\n   $$ L(1 - a) = b $$\n   $$ L = \frac{b}{1 - a} $$\n\n   This formula is valid under the condition that $ |a| < 1 $ to ensure convergence.\n\n### Example\nConsider the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:\n$$ u_{n+1} = 0.5u_n + 2 $$\n\nTo find the limit:\n1. Assume $ L $ is the limit as $ n \to \infty $.\n2. Substitute into the recurrence:\n   $$ L = 0.5L + 2 $$\n3. Rearrange:\n   $$ L - 0.5L = 2 $$\n   $$ 0.5L = 2 $$\n   $$ L = 4 $$\n\nThus, the limit of the sequence is $ L = 4 $.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Convergence Criteria**: Ensure that the conditions for convergence are met, such as $ |a| < 1 $ in linear recurrence relations.\n- **Other Methods**: For sequences not defined by a simple recurrence, you may need to use other methods such as the Squeeze Theorem, L'HÃ´pital's Rule, or direct substitution, depending on the form of the sequence.\n\nIn summary, the limit of a convergent sequence can be calculated by assuming convergence, substituting into the recurrence relation, and solving for the limit.
