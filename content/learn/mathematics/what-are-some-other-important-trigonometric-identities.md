    Trigonometric identities are essential tools in mathematics, particularly in simplifying expressions and solving equations involving trigonometric functions. Here are some important categories of trigonometric identities that are widely used:\n\n1. **Basic Identities**:\n   - Sine and cosine functions: \n     - $ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 $\n   - Tangent function:\n     - $ \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} $\n\n2. **Reciprocal Identities**:\n   - $ \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} $\n   - $ \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} $\n   - $ \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} $\n\n3. **Pythagorean Identities**:\n   - $ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 $\n   - $ 1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta $\n   - $ 1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta $\n\n4. **Sum and Difference Identities**:\n   - \( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \)\n   - \( \cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B \)\n   - \( \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B} \)\n\n5. **Double Angle Identities**:\n   - \( \sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \)\n   - \( \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \)\n   - \( \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} \)\n\n6. **Half-Angle Identities**:\n   - \( \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}} \)\n   - \( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} \)\n   - \( \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} \)\n\n7. **Periodic Identities**:\n   - \( \sin(\theta + 2\pi) = \sin \theta \)\n   - \( \cos(\theta + 2\pi) = \cos \theta \)\n   - \( \tan(\theta + \pi) = \tan \theta \)\n\nThese identities are crucial for solving various mathematical problems and are widely applicable in fields such as geometry, engineering, and physics. Understanding and memorizing these identities can significantly enhance one's ability to work with trigonometric functions effectively.
