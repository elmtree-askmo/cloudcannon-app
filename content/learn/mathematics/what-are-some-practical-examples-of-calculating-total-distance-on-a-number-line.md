    What are some practical examples of calculating total distance on a number line?
answer: >-
    Calculating total distance on a number line involves finding the absolute difference between two points. Here are some practical examples to illustrate this concept:\n\n### Example 1: Distance Between Positive Integers\n**Problem:** Find the distance between the points 4 and 10 on a number line.\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing the distance formula $ D = |x_2 - x_1| $:\n$$\nD = |10 - 4| = |6| = 6 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Example 2: Distance Between a Positive and a Negative Integer\n**Problem:** Calculate the distance between 4 and -4.\n\n**Solution:**\n$$\nD = |4 - (-4)| = |4 + 4| = |8| = 8 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Example 3: Distance Between Two Negative Integers\n**Problem:** Find the distance between -3 and -8.\n\n**Solution:**\n$$\nD = |-3 - (-8)| = |-3 + 8| = |5| = 5 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Example 4: Distance Between a Decimal and an Integer\n**Problem:** Calculate the distance between 2.5 and 9.8.\n\n**Solution:**\n$$\nD = |9.8 - 2.5| = |7.3| = 7.3 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Example 5: Distance Between Two Points with One Negative\n**Problem:** Find the distance between -6 and 4.\n\n**Solution:**\n$$\nD = |4 - (-6)| = |4 + 6| = |10| = 10 \text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Summary\nIn each of these examples, the distance is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the two points on the number line. This method can be applied to any pair of integers or real numbers, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. The concept of distance on a number line is fundamental in various mathematical applications, including statistics and geometry.
