answer: >-
    To multiply decimals with whole numbers, you can follow these basic steps:\n\n1. **Ignore the Decimal Point**: Treat the decimal number as if it were a whole number by temporarily ignoring the decimal point. For example, if you are multiplying $3.6$ by $72$, consider it as $36$.\n\n2. **Multiply Normally**: Multiply the two numbers as you would with whole numbers. Continuing the example, you would calculate $36 \times 72$.\n\n3. **Count Decimal Places**: After performing the multiplication, count the number of decimal places in the decimal number you started with. In this case, $3.6$ has one decimal place.\n\n4. **Place the Decimal Point**: In the product, place the decimal point from right to left according to the number of decimal places counted in the previous step. For instance, if the product of $36 \times 72$ is $2592$, you would place the decimal point one place from the right, resulting in $259.2$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately multiply decimals with whole numbers.
