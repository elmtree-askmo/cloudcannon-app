answer: >-
    In the metric system, the main units of measurement for length, weight (mass), and volume are as follows:\n\n### Length\n- **Meter (m)**: The base unit of length in the metric system.\n- **Kilometer (km)**: 1 kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters (m).\n- **Centimeter (cm)**: 1 centimeter is equal to 0.01 meters (m).\n- **Millimeter (mm)**: 1 millimeter is equal to 0.001 meters (m).\n- **Other units**: Additional units include decimeter (dm), hectometer (hm), micrometer (µm), nanometer (nm), and picometer (pm), which represent various fractions or multiples of a meter.\n\n### Weight (Mass)\n- **Kilogram (kg)**: The base unit of mass in the metric system.\n- **Gram (g)**: 1 kilogram is equal to 1,000 grams (g).\n- **Milligram (mg)**: 1 milligram is equal to 0.001 grams (g).\n- **Other units**: The metric system also includes larger units like metric tons (1 metric ton = 1,000 kilograms) and smaller units like micrograms (µg).\n\n### Volume\n- **Cubic Meter (m³)**: The base unit of volume in the metric system.\n- **Liter (L)**: 1 liter is equal to 0.001 cubic meters (m³) or 1,000 cubic centimeters (cm³).\n- **Milliliter (mL)**: 1 milliliter is equal to 0.001 liters (L) or 1 cubic centimeter (cm³).\n- **Other units**: Additional units include cubic centimeters (cm³) and cubic decimeters (dm³).\n\nThese units are widely used in scientific and everyday measurements due to the metric system's simplicity and ease of conversion, facilitated by its decimal-based structure.
