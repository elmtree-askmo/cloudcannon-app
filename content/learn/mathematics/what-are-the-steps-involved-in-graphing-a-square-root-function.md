    What are the steps involved in graphing a square root function?
answer: >-
    To graph a square root function, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Start with the square root function you want to graph, typically in the form \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) or a transformed version like \( f(x) = a\sqrt{x - h} + k \), where $ a $, $ h $, and $ k $ are constants that affect the graph's shape and position.\n\n2. **Determine the Domain**: The domain of a square root function is restricted to non-negative values because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system. For the basic function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \), the domain is \( [0, \infty) \).\n\n3. **Create a Table of Values**: Choose a set of non-negative $ x $-values (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) and calculate the corresponding $ y $-values using the function. For example:\n   - \( f(0) = \sqrt{0} = 0 \)\n   - \( f(1) = \sqrt{1} = 1 \)\n   - \( f(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 \)\n   - \( f(9) = \sqrt{9} = 3 \)\n   - \( f(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4 \)\n\n4. **Plot the Points**: On a coordinate plane, plot the points obtained from your table. For the example above, you would plot the points (0, 0), (1, 1), (4, 2), (9, 3), and (16, 4).\n\n5. **Draw the Graph**: Connect the plotted points with a smooth curve. The graph of a square root function will start at the origin (0, 0) and rise gradually, resembling half of a parabola that opens to the right.\n\n6. **Identify Key Features**: Note the key features of the graph:\n   - **Starting Point**: The graph starts at (0, 0).\n   - **Increasing Nature**: The function is increasing for all $ x $ in its domain.\n   - **No Maximum**: The function continues to increase without bound as $ x $ increases.\n   - **Minimum Value**: The minimum value of the function is at \( (0, 0) \).\n\n7. **Consider Transformations**: If the function has transformations (like shifts or stretches), apply these to the basic graph. For example, if the function is \( f(x) = \sqrt{x - 2} + 1 \), the graph would shift right by 2 units and up by 1 unit.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph any square root function and understand its characteristics in relation to its quadratic counterpart.
