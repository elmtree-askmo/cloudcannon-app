    How do 90-degree and 270-degree rotations differ in terms of coordinate changes?
answer: >-
    The differences in coordinate changes for 90-degree and 270-degree rotations about the origin can be summarized as follows:\n\n### 90-Degree Rotation\nWhen a point \( A(x, y) \) is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin, the new coordinates \( A'(x', y') \) are given by the transformation rule:\n$$\nx' = -y \\\ny' = x\n$$\nThis means that the x-coordinate becomes the negative of the original y-coordinate, and the y-coordinate becomes the original x-coordinate.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the point \( (2, 3) \):\n- New coordinates after 90-degree counterclockwise rotation: \n  - $ x' = -3 $\n  - $ y' = 2 $\n- Resulting point: \( A'(-3, 2) \)\n\n### 270-Degree Rotation\nA 270-degree rotation clockwise is equivalent to a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise. Therefore, the transformation rule for a point \( A(x, y) \) rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise) is:\n$$\nx' = y \\\ny' = -x\n$$\nIn this case, the x-coordinate becomes the original y-coordinate, and the y-coordinate becomes the negative of the original x-coordinate.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the same point \( (2, 3) \):\n- New coordinates after 270-degree clockwise rotation:\n  - $ x' = 3 $\n  - $ y' = -2 $\n- Resulting point: \( A'(3, -2) \)\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **90-Degree Counterclockwise Rotation**: \n  - Transformation: \( (x, y) \to (-y, x) \)\n- **270-Degree Clockwise Rotation**: \n  - Transformation: \( (x, y) \to (y, -x) \)\n\nBoth transformations result in different final coordinates for the same initial point, reflecting the distinct nature of the rotations.
