    Describe the result of a 180° rotation on a point's coordinates.
answer: >-
    A 180° rotation of a point's coordinates around the origin in a coordinate plane results in a specific transformation of the point's position. \n\nWhen a point with coordinates \((x, y)\) undergoes a 180° rotation, the new coordinates become \((-x, -y)\). This transformation applies regardless of whether the rotation is performed in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, as both will yield the same final position for the point.\n\n### Example:\n- If the original point is \((3, 4)\), after a 180° rotation, the new coordinates will be:\n  $$\n  (-3, -4)\n  $$\n\nThis rule is fundamental in geometry and is particularly useful in various applications, including symmetry analysis and transformations in the coordinate plane.
