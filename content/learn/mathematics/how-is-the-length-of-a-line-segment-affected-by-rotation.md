    How is the length of a line segment affected by rotation?
answer: >-
    The length of a line segment is not affected by rotation. When a line segment is rotated around a fixed point (the center of rotation), its length remains constant regardless of the angle of rotation or the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). \n\nFor example, if you have a line segment AB that is 16 cm long, after a rotation of 24Â° clockwise around point A, the length of segment AB will still be 16 cm. This principle holds true for any line segment; the rotation only changes its position and orientation in the plane, not its length.\n\nThis property is part of the characteristics of rigid transformations, which include rotations, translations, and reflections. Rigid transformations preserve the size, shape, and length of geometric figures. Specifically, the following properties apply to rotations:\n\n1. A rotation maps a line segment to another line segment of the same length.\n2. The lengths of segments are preserved during rotation.\n3. The measures of angles are also preserved.\n\nIn summary, regardless of how a line segment is rotated, its length remains unchanged.
