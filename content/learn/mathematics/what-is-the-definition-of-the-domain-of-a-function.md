    The domain of a function refers to the complete set of all possible values of the independent variable that can be used in the function. Understanding the domain is vital for determining valid input values, identifying restrictions, and analyzing the function's behavior.

    What is the definition of the domain of a function?
answer: >-
    The **domain** of a function is defined as the complete set of all possible values of the independent variable (usually denoted as $ x $) for which the function is defined. In simpler terms, it includes all the input values that can be plugged into the function to yield a valid output.\n\nTo determine the domain of a function, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Identify Restrictions**: Look for values of $ x $ that would make the function undefined. Common restrictions include:\n   - Division by zero (e.g., for the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), the domain excludes $ x = 0 $).\n   - Square roots of negative numbers (e.g., for \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \), the domain is $ x \geq 0 $).\n   - Logarithms of non-positive numbers (e.g., for \( h(x) = \log(x) \), the domain is $ x > 0 $).\n\n2. **Express the Domain**: Once you identify the restrictions, express the domain in interval notation or set notation. For example, the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) can be expressed as \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \).\n\n3. **Graphical Analysis**: If you have a graph of the function, you can visually inspect the horizontal behavior to determine the domain. The domain corresponds to the extent of the graph along the x-axis.\n\nIn summary, the domain is crucial because it determines the values that can be used in the function without leading to undefined situations. Understanding the domain helps in analyzing the behavior of the function and its applications.
