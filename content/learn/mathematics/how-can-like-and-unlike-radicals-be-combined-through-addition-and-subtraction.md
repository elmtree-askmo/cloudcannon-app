answer: >-
    To combine like and unlike radicals through addition and subtraction, it's essential to understand the concept of like radicals. Like radicals are those that have the same index and radicand, while unlike radicals do not share these characteristics.\n\n### Steps to Combine Radicals\n\n1. **Identify Like Radicals**: \n   - Check if the radicals have the same index (the root) and the same radicand (the number or expression inside the radical). For example, $3\sqrt{2}$ and $5\sqrt{2}$ are like radicals because they both have the same index (2) and the same radicand (2).\n\n2. **Combine Like Radicals**:\n   - If the radicals are like, you can combine them by adding or subtracting their coefficients (the numbers in front of the radicals). For example:\n     $$ \n     3\sqrt{2} + 5\sqrt{2} = (3 + 5)\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2} \n     $$\n   - Similarly, for subtraction:\n     $$ \n     7\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{3} = (7 - 2)\sqrt{3} = 5\sqrt{3} \n     $$\n\n3. **Handle Unlike Radicals**:\n   - If the radicals are unlike (e.g., $3\sqrt{2}$ and $4\sqrt{3}$), they cannot be combined. Instead, you simply write them as they are:\n     $$ \n     3\sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{3} \n     $$\n   - You can also rearrange terms to group like radicals together, but the unlike radicals will remain separate.\n\n4. **Simplify Radicals if Necessary**:\n   - Sometimes, you may need to simplify the radicals before combining them. For example, if you have $2\sqrt{12} + \sqrt{27}$, you would first simplify:\n     - $ \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} $ so $ 2\sqrt{12} = 4\sqrt{3} $\n     - $ \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} $\n   - Then combine:\n     $$ \n     4\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{3} = (4 + 3)\sqrt{3} = 7\sqrt{3} \n     $$\n\n### Summary\n- **Like Radicals**: Same index and radicand can be combined by adding or subtracting coefficients.\n- **Unlike Radicals**: Different index or radicand cannot be combined and should be left as separate terms.\n- **Simplification**: Always simplify radicals first if possible to identify like radicals.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively combine radicals through addition and subtraction.
