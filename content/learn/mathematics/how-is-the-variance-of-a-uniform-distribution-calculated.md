    How is the variance of a uniform distribution calculated?
answer: >-
    The variance of a uniform distribution can be calculated using specific formulas depending on whether the distribution is discrete or continuous.\n\n1. **Continuous Uniform Distribution**: For a continuous uniform distribution defined over the interval $[a, b]$, the variance is given by the formula:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Var}(X) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}\n   $$\n\n   Here, $a$ is the minimum value and $b$ is the maximum value of the distribution.\n\n2. **Discrete Uniform Distribution**: For a discrete uniform distribution where there are $n$ equally likely outcomes, the variance can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   $$\n   \text{Var}(X) = \frac{(n^2 - 1)}{12}\n   $$\n\n   In this case, $n$ represents the number of discrete outcomes.\n\nIn both cases, the variance measures the spread of the distribution around its mean, indicating how much the values of the random variable deviate from the expected value. The standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance, provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data.
