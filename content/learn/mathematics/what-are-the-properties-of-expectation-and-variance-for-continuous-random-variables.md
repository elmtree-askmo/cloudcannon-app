    What are the properties of expectation and variance for continuous random variables?
answer: >-
    The properties of expectation and variance for continuous random variables are fundamental concepts in probability and statistics. These properties are analogous to those for discrete random variables, and they provide insights into the behavior of continuous distributions.\n\n### Expectation (Mean)\n\n1. **Definition**: The expected value (or mean) of a continuous random variable \(X\) is defined as:\n   $$\n   E[X] = \mu = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n   where \(f(x)\) is the probability density function (PDF) of the random variable \(X\).\n\n2. **Linearity of Expectation**: The expected value has the property of linearity, which means that for any two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), and constants \(a\) and \(b\):\n   $$\n   E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]\n   $$\n\n3. **Expectation of Functions**: If \(g(X)\) is a function of the random variable \(X\), then the expected value can be computed as:\n   $$\n   E[g(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n\n### Variance\n\n1. **Definition**: The variance of a continuous random variable \(X\) measures the spread of its values around the mean and is defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n   Alternatively, it can be computed using the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2\n   $$\n   where \(E[X^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) \, dx\).\n\n2. **Non-negativity**: The variance is always non-negative, i.e., \(\text{Var}(X) \geq 0\).\n\n3. **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation, denoted as \(\sigma\), is the square root of the variance:\n   $$\n   \sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}\n   $$\n\n### Properties of Expectation and Variance\n\n- **Independence**: If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent continuous random variables, then:\n  $$\n  \text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)\n  $$\n  and\n  $$\n  E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]\n  $$\n\n- **Effect of Linear Transformations**: If \(Y = aX + b\) for constants \(a\) and \(b\):\n  - The expected value transforms as:\n    $$\n    E[Y] = aE[X] + b\n    $$\n  - The variance transforms as:\n    $$\n    \text{Var}(Y) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)\n    $$\n\nThese properties are essential for understanding the behavior of continuous random variables and are widely used in statistical analysis and modeling.
