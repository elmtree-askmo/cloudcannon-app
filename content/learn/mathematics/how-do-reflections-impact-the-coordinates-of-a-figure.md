    How do reflections impact the coordinates of a figure?
answer: >-
    Reflections in geometry are transformations that flip a figure across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This transformation results in a mirror image of the original figure, preserving its size and shape but reversing its orientation. The impact of reflections on the coordinates of a figure can be understood through the following key concepts:\n\n### 1. Line of Reflection\nThe line of reflection acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include:\n- **x-axis**: For a point \((x, y)\), the reflection across the x-axis results in the point \((x, -y)\).\n- **y-axis**: For a point \((x, y)\), the reflection across the y-axis results in the point \((-x, y)\).\n- **Line $y = x$**: For a point \((x, y)\), the reflection across the line $y = x$ results in the point \((y, x)\).\n\n### 2. Coordinate Transformation\nWhen a figure is reflected across a line, the coordinates of each point in the figure are transformed according to the line of reflection. Here are some examples:\n\n- **Reflection across the x-axis**:\n  - Original point: \((3, 4)\)\n  - Reflected point: \((3, -4)\)\n\n- **Reflection across the y-axis**:\n  - Original point: \((3, 4)\)\n  - Reflected point: \((-3, 4)\)\n\n- **Reflection across the line $y = x$**:\n  - Original point: \((3, 4)\)\n  - Reflected point: \((4, 3)\)\n\n### 3. Properties of Reflections\nReflections have several important properties:\n- **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape.\n- **Distance Preservation**: The distance between any two points in the original figure is the same as the distance between their corresponding points in the reflected figure.\n- **Orientation**: The orientation of the figure is reversed after reflection. For example, if the original figure is oriented clockwise, the reflected figure will be oriented counterclockwise.\n\n### 4. Applications\nReflections are widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering, to model symmetrical properties and behaviors. They are also fundamental in understanding symmetry in geometric figures.\n\nIn summary, reflections impact the coordinates of a figure by transforming each point according to the line of reflection, resulting in a congruent but mirrored image of the original figure. This transformation preserves distances and reverses orientation, making it a crucial concept in geometry.
