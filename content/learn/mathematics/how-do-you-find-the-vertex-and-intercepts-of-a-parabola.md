    To find the vertex and intercepts of a parabola, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Finding the Vertex\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Quadratic Function**: The standard form of a quadratic function is given by:\n   $$\n   y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   $$\n   where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\n2. **Calculate the x-coordinate of the Vertex**: The x-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n\n3. **Calculate the y-coordinate of the Vertex**: Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the original quadratic function to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n   $$\n   y = a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) + c\n   $$\n\n4. **Vertex Point**: The vertex of the parabola is then the point \(\left(-\frac{b}{2a}, y\right)\).\n\n### Finding the Intercepts\n\n1. **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept of the parabola can be found by evaluating the function at $x = 0$:\n   $$\n   y = c\n   $$\n   Thus, the y-intercept is the point \((0, c)\).\n\n2. **X-Intercepts**: To find the x-intercepts (roots), set the quadratic function equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   $$\n   You can use the quadratic formula:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n   The solutions will give you the x-intercepts, which are the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis.\n\n### Summary\n\n- The vertex of the parabola is found using the formulas for the x and y coordinates derived from the standard form of the quadratic function.\n- The y-intercept is simply the value of $c$ when $x = 0$.\n- The x-intercepts can be found using the quadratic formula, which provides the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis.\n\nUnderstanding the vertex and intercepts is crucial for graphing the parabola and analyzing its characteristics, such as direction of opening and symmetry.
