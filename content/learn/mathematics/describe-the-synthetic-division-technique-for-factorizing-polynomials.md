    Describe the synthetic division technique for factorizing polynomials.
answer: >-
    Synthetic division is a streamlined method for dividing polynomials, particularly useful when the divisor is a linear factor of the form $x - a$. This technique simplifies the division process by focusing on the coefficients of the polynomial rather than the variables and exponents, making it easier and quicker than traditional long division.\n\n### Steps for Synthetic Division\n\n1. **Set Up the Division**: \n   - Write down the coefficients of the polynomial in descending order. If any degree is missing, use a coefficient of 0 for that term.\n   - Identify the root $a$ from the divisor $x - a$.\n\n2. **Draw the Synthetic Division Bar**: \n   - Place the root $a$ to the left and the coefficients to the right.\n\n3. **Bring Down the Leading Coefficient**: \n   - Start by bringing down the leading coefficient (the first number) directly below the line.\n\n4. **Multiply and Add**: \n   - Multiply the number you just brought down by $a$ and write the result under the next coefficient.\n   - Add this result to the next coefficient and write the sum below the line.\n   - Repeat this process: multiply the last result by $a$ and add to the next coefficient until all coefficients have been processed.\n\n5. **Interpret the Result**: \n   - The numbers you have below the line represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial. The last number is the remainder.\n   - If the remainder is zero, then $x - a$ is a factor of the polynomial.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider the polynomial $2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 4$ and divide it by $x - 3$:\n\n1. Coefficients: $2, -6, 2, -4$\n2. Root: $3$\n\nSetting it up:\n\n```\n3 |  2  -6   2  -4\n  |      6   0   6\n-------------------\n    2   0   2   2\n```\n\n- Bring down $2$.\n- Multiply $2$ by $3$ to get $6$, add to $-6$ to get $0$.\n- Multiply $0$ by $3$ to get $0$, add to $2$ to get $2$.\n- Multiply $2$ by $3$ to get $6$, add to $-4$ to get $2$.\n\nThe result is $2x^2 + 0x + 2$ with a remainder of $2$. Thus, we can express the original polynomial as:\n\n$$\n2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 4 = (x - 3)(2x^2 + 2) + 2\n$$\n\n### Advantages of Synthetic Division\n\n- **Efficiency**: It requires fewer steps than long division.\n- **Simplicity**: It eliminates the need to write variables and exponents, focusing solely on coefficients.\n- **Ease of Use**: It is often easier to teach and remember, making it a preferred method for many students.\n\nIn summary, synthetic division is a powerful tool for polynomial factorization, especially when dealing with linear factors, and it simplifies the division process significantly.
