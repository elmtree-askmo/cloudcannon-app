    What is the role of derivatives in determining increasing and decreasing functions?
answer: >-
    Derivatives play a fundamental role in determining whether a function is increasing or decreasing. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how this works:\n\n1. **First Derivative and Rate of Change**: The first derivative of a function, denoted as \( f'(x) \), provides information about the rate of change of the function with respect to its variable $ x $. Specifically:\n   - If \( f'(x) > 0 \) for an interval, the function \( f(x) \) is increasing on that interval. This means that as $ x $ increases, \( f(x) \) also increases.\n   - If \( f'(x) < 0 \) for an interval, the function \( f(x) \) is decreasing on that interval. This indicates that as $ x $ increases, \( f(x) \) decreases.\n   - If \( f'(x) = 0 \), the function may be at a stationary point, which could be a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\n2. **Critical Points**: To find critical points where the function may change from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa), we set the first derivative equal to zero:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 0\n   $$\n   Solving this equation gives us the critical points. These points are essential for applying the First Derivative Test, which helps classify the nature of these points.\n\n3. **First Derivative Test**: After identifying the critical points, we can analyze the sign of the first derivative in the intervals defined by these points:\n   - Choose test points in each interval and evaluate \( f'(x) \) at these points.\n   - If \( f'(x) \) changes from positive to negative at a critical point, that point is a local maximum.\n   - If \( f'(x) \) changes from negative to positive, that point is a local minimum.\n   - If \( f'(x) \) does not change sign, the critical point is neither a maximum nor a minimum.\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation**: The behavior of the first derivative can also be visualized graphically. The graph of \( f(x) \) will rise (increase) where the first derivative is positive and fall (decrease) where the first derivative is negative. This understanding is crucial for sketching graphs and analyzing the overall behavior of functions.\n\n5. **Examples**: For instance, consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n   - The first derivative is \( f'(x) = 2x \).\n   - Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) gives $ x = 0 $ as a critical point.\n   - For $ x < 0 $, \( f'(x) < 0 \) (decreasing), and for $ x > 0 $, \( f'(x) > 0 \) (increasing). Thus, \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at $ x = 0 $.\n\nIn summary, derivatives are essential for determining the intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing, identifying critical points, and classifying the nature of these points. This analysis is crucial in calculus for understanding the behavior of functions and solving optimization problems.
