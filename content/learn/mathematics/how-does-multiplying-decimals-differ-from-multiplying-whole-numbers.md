answer: >-
    Multiplying decimals differs from multiplying whole numbers primarily in the handling of the decimal point in the final product. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Ignoring the Decimal Point**: When multiplying decimals, the first step is to ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. For example, to multiply 9.526 by 2.6, you would first calculate 9526 × 26.\n\n2. **Counting Decimal Places**: After performing the multiplication, you need to determine the total number of decimal places in the original numbers. This is done by counting the decimal places in each factor. In the example of 9.526 (which has 3 decimal places) and 2.6 (which has 1 decimal place), the total is 4 decimal places.\n\n3. **Placing the Decimal Point**: The final step is to place the decimal point in the product. The product should have the same number of decimal places as the total counted in the previous step. For instance, from the multiplication of 9526 and 26, you would get 247676. Since you counted 4 decimal places, you would place the decimal point to get 24.7676.\n\n4. **Multiplying Whole Numbers with Decimals**: When multiplying a whole number by a decimal, the process is similar. You ignore the decimal point in the decimal number, perform the multiplication, and then place the decimal point in the product based on the decimal places in the decimal number. For example, multiplying 72 (whole number) by 3.6 (decimal) involves calculating 72 × 36 = 2592, and since 3.6 has 1 decimal place, the final answer is 259.2.\n\n5. **Importance of Decimal Point Placement**: The placement of the decimal point is crucial because it affects the value of the product. Misplacing the decimal point can lead to significant errors in calculations.\n\nIn summary, while the multiplication process itself is similar to that of whole numbers, the key difference lies in the careful handling of the decimal point to ensure the accuracy of the final result.
