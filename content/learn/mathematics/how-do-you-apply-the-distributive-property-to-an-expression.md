    How do you apply the distributive property to an expression?
answer: >-
    The distributive property is a fundamental principle in algebra that allows you to simplify expressions by distributing a factor over terms inside parentheses. It states that for any numbers or variables $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n\n$$\nA \times (B + C) = A \times B + A \times C\n$$\n\nThis means that you can multiply $A$ by each term inside the parentheses separately and then add the results.\n\n### Example of Applying the Distributive Property\n\nConsider the expression \(3(x + 4)\). To apply the distributive property, you would do the following:\n\n1. Multiply $3$ by $x$:\n   - $3 \times x = 3x$\n\n2. Multiply $3$ by $4$:\n   - $3 \times 4 = 12$\n\n3. Combine the results:\n   - \(3(x + 4) = 3x + 12\)\n\n### Handling Subtraction\n\nThe distributive property also applies when dealing with subtraction. For example, if you have \(5(2 - 3)\), you would distribute as follows:\n\n1. Multiply $5$ by $2$:\n   - $5 \times 2 = 10$\n\n2. Multiply $5$ by $-3$:\n   - $5 \times -3 = -15$\n\n3. Combine the results:\n   - \(5(2 - 3) = 10 - 15 = -5\)\n\n### Importance of the Distributive Property\n\nUsing the distributive property helps simplify complex expressions and is essential for solving equations. It allows you to eliminate parentheses, making it easier to combine like terms and perform further operations. This property is particularly useful in various algebraic contexts, including multiplying binomials and factoring polynomials.\n\nIn summary, the distributive property is a powerful tool in algebra that simplifies expressions by distributing a factor across terms within parentheses, whether they are added or subtracted.
