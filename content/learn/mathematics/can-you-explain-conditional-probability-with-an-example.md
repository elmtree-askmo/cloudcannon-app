    Can you explain conditional probability with an example?
answer: >-
    Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory that measures the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as \( P(A|B) \), which represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n\nThe formula for calculating conditional probability is:\n\n$$\nP(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( P(A|B) \) is the conditional probability of A given B,\n- \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability of both A and B occurring,\n- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B occurring.\n\n### Example of Conditional Probability\n\nConsider a simple example involving weather and outdoor activities. Let's say we have the following probabilities:\n- The probability that it is raining on a given day, \( P(R) = 0.3 \).\n- The probability that a person carries an umbrella, \( P(U) = 0.8 \).\n- The probability that a person carries an umbrella given that it is raining, \( P(U|R) = 0.9 \).\n\nTo find the conditional probability that it is raining given that a person is carrying an umbrella, we can use Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$\nP(R|U) = \frac{P(U|R) \cdot P(R)}{P(U)}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n1. \( P(U|R) = 0.9 \)\n2. \( P(R) = 0.3 \)\n3. \( P(U) = 0.8 \)\n\nNow, we can calculate \( P(R|U) \):\n\n$$\nP(R|U) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.8} = \frac{0.27}{0.8} = 0.3375\n$$\n\nThus, the conditional probability that it is raining given that a person is carrying an umbrella is approximately 0.3375, or 33.75%.\n\nThis example illustrates how conditional probability can be used to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new information.
