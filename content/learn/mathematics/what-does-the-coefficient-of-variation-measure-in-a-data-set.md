answer: >-
    The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that quantifies the relative variability of a dataset in relation to its mean. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, often expressed as a percentage:\n\n$$\nCV = \left( \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \right) \times 100\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the dataset.\n- $\mu$ is the mean of the dataset.\n\n### Key Points about the Coefficient of Variation:\n\n1. **Standardized Measure**: The CV is a unit-free measure, which allows for the comparison of variability across different datasets, even if they are measured in different units or have different means.\n\n2. **Comparison of Variability**: It is particularly useful when comparing the relative variability of two or more datasets. For example, if one dataset has a higher standard deviation but also a higher mean, the CV can help determine which dataset has more relative variability.\n\n3. **Interpretation**: A higher CV indicates greater relative variability, while a lower CV suggests less variability relative to the mean. This can be particularly useful in fields such as finance, where comparing the risk (volatility) of different investments is essential.\n\n4. **Application**: The CV is often used in various fields, including economics, biology, and quality control, to assess the consistency of data and make informed decisions based on variability.\n\nIn summary, the coefficient of variation measures the size of the standard deviation relative to the size of the mean, providing a standardized way to compare the relative variability of different datasets.
