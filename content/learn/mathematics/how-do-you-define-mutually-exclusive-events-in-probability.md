    Mutually exclusive events in probability are events that cannot occur at the same time. This concept is fundamental in probability theory, where the occurrence of one event implies that the other cannot happen simultaneously. Examples include rolling different numbers on a die or the outcomes of a coin toss.

    How do you define mutually exclusive events in probability?
answer: >-
    In probability theory, mutually exclusive events are defined as two or more events that cannot occur simultaneously. This means that if one event occurs, the other cannot happen at the same time. For example, when rolling a single six-sided die, the events of rolling a 3 (Event A) and rolling a 5 (Event B) are mutually exclusive because both outcomes cannot happen in a single roll.\n\nMathematically, if A and B are mutually exclusive events, the probability of both A and B occurring together is zero, expressed as:\n\n$$\nP(A \cap B) = 0\n$$\n\nFurthermore, the probability of either event A or event B occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n$$\n\nThis property is fundamental in probability theory and is often used in conjunction with the Addition Rule of Probability. For instance, if you were to consider the outcome of a coin toss, getting heads (Event H) and getting tails (Event T) are also mutually exclusive events, as both cannot occur at the same time.\n\nIn summary, mutually exclusive events are characterized by their inability to occur together, and their probabilities can be calculated using the rules outlined above.
