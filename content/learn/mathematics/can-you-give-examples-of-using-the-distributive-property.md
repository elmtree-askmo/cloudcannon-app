answer: >-
    The distributive property is a fundamental concept in algebra that allows us to simplify expressions by distributing a factor over terms inside parentheses. It can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nA \times (B + C) = (A \times B) + (A \times C)\n$$\n\nHere are some examples of using the distributive property:\n\n1. **Basic Example**:\n   - Expression: \( 3(x + 4) \)\n   - Using the distributive property: \n     $$\n     3(x + 4) = 3x + 12\n     $$\n\n2. **With Addition**:\n   - Expression: \( 5(40 + 3) \)\n   - Using the distributive property:\n     $$\n     5(40 + 3) = (5 \times 40) + (5 \times 3) = 200 + 15 = 215\n     $$\n\n3. **With Subtraction**:\n   - Expression: \( 7(20 - 3) \)\n   - Using the distributive property:\n     $$\n     7(20 - 3) = (7 \times 20) - (7 \times 3) = 140 - 21 = 119\n     $$\n\n4. **With Fractions**:\n   - Expression: \( \frac{1}{4}(2 + 3) \)\n   - Using the distributive property:\n     $$\n     \frac{1}{4}(2 + 3) = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 + \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\n     $$\n\n5. **Complex Expression**:\n   - Expression: \( 3x^2(6x^3 + 2x^2) \)\n   - Using the distributive property:\n     $$\n     3x^2(6x^3 + 2x^2) = (3x^2 \times 6x^3) + (3x^2 \times 2x^2) = 18x^5 + 6x^4\n     $$\n\nThese examples illustrate how the distributive property can be applied to simplify various algebraic expressions, making it easier to perform operations and solve equations.
