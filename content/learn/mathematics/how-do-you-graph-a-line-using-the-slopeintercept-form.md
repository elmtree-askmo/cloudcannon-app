    How do you graph a line using the slope-intercept form?
answer: >-
    To graph a line using the slope-intercept form, you will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Slope and Y-Intercept**: The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is given by:\n\n   $$\n   y = mx + b\n   $$\n\n   Here, $ m $ represents the slope of the line, and $ b $ is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n\n2. **Plot the Y-Intercept**: Start by plotting the y-intercept on the graph. This point is represented as (0, b). For example, if the equation is $ y = 2x + 3 $, the y-intercept is 3, so you would plot the point (0, 3) on the graph.\n\n3. **Use the Slope to Find Another Point**: The slope $ m $ is expressed as a fraction $ \frac{rise}{run} $. From the y-intercept, use the slope to find another point on the line. For instance, if the slope is 2 (which can be written as $ \frac{2}{1} $), you would rise 2 units up and run 1 unit to the right from the y-intercept. This would give you the next point (1, 5) if you started at (0, 3).\n\n4. **Draw the Line**: Once you have at least two points plotted on the graph, draw a straight line through these points, extending it in both directions. Make sure to use an arrow at both ends to indicate that the line continues infinitely.\n\n5. **Label the Line**: Optionally, you can label the line with its equation for clarity.\n\n### Example\nFor the equation $ y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 6 $:\n\n- **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is 6, so plot the point (0, 6).\n- **Slope**: The slope is $ -\frac{3}{4} $. From (0, 6), move down 3 units (rise) and right 4 units (run) to find the next point at (4, 3).\n- **Draw the Line**: Connect the points (0, 6) and (4, 3) with a straight line, extending it in both directions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph any line given in slope-intercept form.
