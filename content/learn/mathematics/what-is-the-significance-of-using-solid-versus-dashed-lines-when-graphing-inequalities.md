answer: >-
    The significance of using solid versus dashed lines when graphing inequalities lies in the inclusion or exclusion of the boundary points in the solution set.\n\n1. **Solid Line**: A solid line is used when the inequality includes the boundary points, which occurs with the symbols $ \geq $ (greater than or equal to) and $ \leq $ (less than or equal to). This indicates that points on the line itself are part of the solution set. For example, if you are graphing the inequality $ y \leq 2x + 3 $, the line $ y = 2x + 3 $ would be drawn as a solid line, meaning that any point on this line satisfies the inequality.\n\n2. **Dashed Line**: A dashed line is used for strict inequalities, represented by the symbols $ > $ (greater than) and $ < $ (less than). This indicates that points on the line are not included in the solution set. For instance, if you are graphing the inequality $ y < 2x + 3 $, the line $ y = 2x + 3 $ would be drawn as a dashed line, meaning that points on this line do not satisfy the inequality.\n\nIn summary, the choice between a solid and dashed line is crucial for accurately representing the solution set of the inequality on a graph. It visually communicates whether the boundary points are included in the solution (solid line) or excluded (dashed line).
