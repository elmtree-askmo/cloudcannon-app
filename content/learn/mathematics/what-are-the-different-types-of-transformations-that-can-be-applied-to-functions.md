    Transformations of functions are crucial for understanding how the graphs of functions can be manipulated and analyzed. Here are the main types of transformations that can be applied to functions:\n\n1. **Translations (Shifts)**:\n   - **Horizontal Shifts**: The graph of a function can be shifted left or right. For example, the function \( f(x) = (x - h)^2 \) shifts the graph of \( f(x) = x^2 \) to the right by $ h $ units, while \( f(x) = (x + h)^2 \) shifts it to the left by $ h $ units.\n   - **Vertical Shifts**: The graph can also be shifted up or down. For instance, \( g(x) = f(x) + k \) shifts the graph of \( f(x) \) upwards by $ k $ units, and \( g(x) = f(x) - k \) shifts it downwards by $ k $ units.\n\n2. **Reflections**:\n   - **Reflection About the x-axis**: This transformation is represented by \( g(x) = -f(x) \), which flips the graph over the x-axis. For example, the function $ y = -x^2 $ reflects the parabola $ y = x^2 $ over the x-axis.\n   - **Reflection About the y-axis**: This transformation is represented by \( g(x) = f(-x) \), which flips the graph over the y-axis.\n\n3. **Stretches and Compressions**:\n   - **Vertical Stretch/Compression**: This is represented by \( g(x) = a \cdot f(x) \). If $ |a| > 1 $, the graph is stretched vertically; if $ 0 < |a| < 1 $, it is compressed vertically.\n   - **Horizontal Stretch/Compression**: This is represented by \( g(x) = f(bx) \). If $ |b| > 1 $, the graph is compressed horizontally; if $ 0 < |b| < 1 $, it is stretched horizontally.\n\n4. **Combining Transformations**:\n   - Multiple transformations can be combined. For example, the function \( f(x) = a \cdot g(b(x - h)) + k \) incorporates vertical and horizontal stretches/compressions, shifts, and reflections, where $ a $ and $ b $ affect the vertical and horizontal scaling, respectively, and $ h $ and $ k $ represent the shifts.\n\n5. **Specific Examples**:\n   - For square root functions, transformations can include vertical shifts (e.g., \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} + 2 \) shifts the graph up by 2 units) and horizontal shifts (e.g., \( g(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \) shifts the graph right by 3 units).\n   - For quadratic functions, the transformation \( y = (x - 4)^2 \) represents a horizontal shift of the parabola $ y = x^2 $ to the right by 4 units.\n\nUnderstanding these transformations is essential for analyzing and graphing functions effectively, as they allow for the modeling of various real-world scenarios and the exploration of function behaviors.
