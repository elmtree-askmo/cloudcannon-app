    Describe the process of performing a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin.
answer: >-
    To perform a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin in the coordinate plane, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotation Rule**: The rule for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin is given by the transformation of coordinates from \((x, y)\) to \((y, -x)\). This means that for any point $M$ with coordinates \((x, y)\), after the rotation, the new coordinates $M'$ will be \((y, -x)\).\n\n2. **Apply the Rule**: For each point of the geometric figure you want to rotate, apply the transformation. For example, if you have a point $A$ at coordinates \((3, 4)\):\n   - The new coordinates after rotation will be:\n   $$\n   A' = (4, -3)\n   $$\n\n3. **Repeat for All Points**: If you have multiple points, repeat the transformation for each point. For instance, if you have points \(B(1, 2)\) and \(C(-3, 5)\):\n   - For point $B$:\n   $$\n   B' = (2, -1)\n   $$\n   - For point $C$:\n   $$\n   C' = (5, 3)\n   $$\n\n4. **Graph the New Figure**: After calculating the new coordinates for all points, plot these points on the coordinate plane. Connect the points in the same order as they were connected in the original figure to visualize the rotated figure.\n\n5. **Check Your Work**: Ensure that the transformation has been applied correctly by verifying that the distances and angles between points remain consistent with the original figure, as rotation does not change the size or shape of the figure.\n\n### Example\nLet's say we want to rotate the triangle with vertices at \(A(1, 1)\), \(B(2, 3)\), and \(C(3, 1)\) by 90 degrees clockwise about the origin.\n\n- For \(A(1, 1)\):\n  $$\n  A' = (1, -1)\n  $$\n- For \(B(2, 3)\):\n  $$\n  B' = (3, -2)\n  $$\n- For \(C(3, 1)\):\n  $$\n  C' = (1, -3)\n  $$\n\nThe new vertices of the triangle after the rotation will be \(A'(1, -1)\), \(B'(3, -2)\), and \(C'(1, -3)\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully perform a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin for any geometric figure or set of points.
