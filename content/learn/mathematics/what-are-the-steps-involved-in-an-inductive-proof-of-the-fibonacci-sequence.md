    What are the steps involved in an inductive proof of the Fibonacci sequence?
answer: >-
    To prove properties of the Fibonacci sequence using mathematical induction, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Property**: Clearly state the property \( P(n) \) that you want to prove for all integers $ n \geq 1 $. For example, you might want to prove that $ F_n $ (the nth Fibonacci number) satisfies a certain equation or inequality.\n\n2. **Base Case**: Establish the base case(s). This is crucial as it serves as the foundation for the entire inductive proof. For the Fibonacci sequence, you would typically check the smallest values of $ n $. For instance:\n   - Verify \( P(1) \): Check that the property holds for $ n = 1 $. For example, if \( P(n) \) states that $ F_n $ is a certain value, confirm that $ F_1 = 1 $ satisfies this property.\n   - You may also need to check \( P(2) \) or \( P(3) \) depending on the nature of the property, especially since Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively.\n\n3. **Inductive Step**: Assume that the property holds for some arbitrary integer $ k $ (this is your inductive hypothesis). That is, assume \( P(k) \) is true. Then, you need to show that \( P(k+1) \) is also true. This often involves using the recursive definition of Fibonacci numbers:\n   $$ F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $$\n   You would manipulate the expressions involving $ F_k $, $ F_{k-1} $, and $ F_{k-2} $ to demonstrate that the property holds for $ k+1 $.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: After successfully proving the base case and the inductive step, you can conclude that the property \( P(n) \) holds for all integers $ n \geq 1 $ by the principle of mathematical induction.\n\n### Example\nFor instance, if you want to prove that $ F_n $ is always odd for odd $ n $:\n- **Base Case**: Check \( P(1) \): $ F_1 = 1 $ (which is odd).\n- **Inductive Step**: Assume \( P(k) \) is true for some odd $ k $. Show that $ F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k $ is also odd, using the fact that the sum of two odd numbers is even and the sum of an even and an odd number is odd.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use mathematical induction to prove properties related to the Fibonacci sequence.
