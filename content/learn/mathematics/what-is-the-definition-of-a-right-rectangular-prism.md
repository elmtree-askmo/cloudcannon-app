    What is the definition of a right rectangular prism?
answer: >-
    A right rectangular prism is a three-dimensional geometric shape characterized by having six faces, all of which are rectangles. It has 12 edges and 8 vertices, with all angles formed at the vertices being right angles (90Â°). The structure includes two parallel end faces (bases) and four lateral faces, which are also rectangles. The lateral faces are perpendicular to the bases, distinguishing it from a non-right rectangular prism, also known as an oblique prism, where the lateral faces are parallelograms.\n\nIn summary, the defining attributes of a right rectangular prism are:\n- Six rectangular faces\n- Twelve edges\n- Eight vertices\n- Right angles at all vertices\n\nThis shape is commonly referred to as a cuboid and is prevalent in various applications, particularly in packaging and manufacturing, due to its efficient use of space and ease of stacking.
