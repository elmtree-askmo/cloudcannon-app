    What steps are involved in graphing a cube root function?
answer: >-
    To graph a cube root function, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Understand the Basic Form\nThe general form of a cube root function is given by:\n$$\nf(x) = a \sqrt[3]{x - h} + k\n$$\nwhere:\n- $ a $ is a coefficient that affects the vertical stretch or compression and the direction of the graph (upward or downward).\n- \( (h, k) \) is the point of translation, shifting the graph horizontally and vertically.\n\n### 2. Identify Key Features\n- **Domain and Range:** The domain and range of cube root functions are both \( (-\infty, \infty) \), meaning they are defined for all real numbers.\n- **Point of Inflection:** The graph has a point of inflection at the origin (0,0) for the basic function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \).\n- **Behavior:** The graph extends into both the positive and negative quadrants, reflecting the fact that both positive and negative numbers have cube roots.\n\n### 3. Create a Table of Values\nSelect $ x $-values that are perfect cubes to make calculations easier. For example, you can choose:\n- $ -27, -8, -1, 0, 1, 8, 27 $\n\nCalculate the corresponding $ y $-values using the function. For instance, for \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \):\n- \( f(-27) = -3 \)\n- \( f(-8) = -2 \)\n- \( f(-1) = -1 \)\n- \( f(0) = 0 \)\n- \( f(1) = 1 \)\n- \( f(8) = 2 \)\n- \( f(27) = 3 \)\n\n### 4. Plot the Points\nUsing the table of values, plot the points on a coordinate plane. For example:\n- Plot the points: \( (-27, -3), (-8, -2), (-1, -1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (8, 2), (27, 3) \).\n\n### 5. Connect the Points\nDraw a smooth curve through the plotted points. The graph should reflect the continuous nature of the cube root function, showing a gradual increase or decrease without any breaks.\n\n### 6. Apply Transformations (if applicable)\nIf the function includes transformations (like shifts or stretches), apply these to the graph:\n- **Horizontal Shift:** If $ h $ is not zero, shift the graph left or right.\n- **Vertical Shift:** If $ k $ is not zero, shift the graph up or down.\n- **Vertical Stretch/Compression:** If $ a $ is greater than 1, the graph stretches; if $ 0 < a < 1 $, it compresses.\n\n### Example\nFor the function \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x - 1} + 2 \):\n1. Identify the transformations: Shift right by 1 and up by 2.\n2. Create a table with $ x $-values like $ -6, -1, 0, 1, 8 $.\n3. Calculate $ y $-values:\n   - \( f(-6) = \sqrt[3]{-6 - 1} + 2 = \sqrt[3]{-7} + 2 \)\n   - Continue for other values.\n4. Plot and connect the points, applying the transformations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph any cube root function and understand its key features.
