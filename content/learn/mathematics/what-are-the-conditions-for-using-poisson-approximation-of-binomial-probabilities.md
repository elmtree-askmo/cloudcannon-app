    The Poisson approximation of binomial probabilities simplifies statistical calculations under specific conditions: a large number of trials (n) and a small probability of success (p). Typically, n should be at least 100 and np should be less than or equal to 10 for a good approximation.

    What are the conditions for using Poisson approximation of binomial probabilities?
answer: >-
    The Poisson approximation of binomial probabilities is a useful statistical technique that simplifies calculations when dealing with binomial distributions under certain conditions. The key conditions for using the Poisson approximation are:\n\n1. **Large Number of Trials (n)**: The number of trials \( n \) should be large. A common rule of thumb is that \( n \) should be at least 100, although this can vary depending on the specific context.\n\n2. **Small Probability of Success (p)**: The probability of success \( p \) should be small. This means that the expected number of successes, given by \( \lambda = np \), should also be small. A typical guideline is that \( np \leq 10 \).\n\n3. **Limiting Case**: The Poisson distribution can be viewed as a limiting case of the binomial distribution when \( n \) approaches infinity and \( p \) approaches zero, such that the product \( np \) remains constant.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the binomial distribution \( \text{Bin}(n, p) \) can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter \( \lambda = np \). This approximation is particularly useful because it simplifies the calculations involved in determining probabilities for binomial distributions, especially when \( n \) is large and \( p \) is small.\n\nIn summary, the conditions for using the Poisson approximation to binomial probabilities are:\n- \( n \) is large (typically \( n \geq 100 \))\n- \( p \) is small (typically \( np \leq 10 \))\n\nThese conditions ensure that the Poisson distribution provides a good approximation to the binomial distribution, making it easier to compute probabilities in practical applications.
