    Complementary events in probability are outcomes that are mutually exclusive, covering all possible results of an experiment. The total probability of an event and its complement equals one, allowing for easier calculations of probabilities.

    What are complementary events in probability?
answer: >-
    Complementary events in probability are a fundamental concept that refers to two outcomes that are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one event occurs, the other cannot. In other words, complementary events cover all possible outcomes of a given experiment. \n\nThe rule of complementary events states that the probability of an event $ A $ occurring, denoted as \( P(A) \), plus the probability of the event not occurring, denoted as \( P(A') \), equals 1. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\nP(A) + P(A') = 1\n$$\n\nFrom this rule, we can derive the probability of the complementary event $ A' $ as follows:\n\n$$\nP(A') = 1 - P(A)\n$$\n\nFor example, consider the event of rolling a die. Let event $ A $ be rolling a number greater than 3 (i.e., rolling a 4, 5, or 6). The complementary event $ A' $ would be rolling a number that is 3 or less (i.e., rolling a 1, 2, or 3). The probabilities can be calculated as follows:\n\n- \( P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \) (rolling a 4, 5, or 6)\n- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \) (rolling a 1, 2, or 3)\n\nComplementary events are useful in various probability calculations, especially when it is easier to calculate the probability of the complement rather than the event itself. For instance, if you want to find the probability of at least one success in multiple trials, it can be easier to calculate the probability of no successes (the complement) and subtract that from 1.\n\nIn summary, complementary events are essential in probability theory, providing a straightforward way to understand the relationship between different outcomes and facilitating calculations involving probabilities.
