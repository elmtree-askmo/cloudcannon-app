    What are the three main types of geometric transformations?
answer: >-
    The three main types of geometric transformations are:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation involves moving every point of a geometric figure a certain distance in a specified direction. The shape and orientation of the figure remain unchanged. For example, if you have a triangle and you slide it to the right by 3 units, every vertex of the triangle moves 3 units to the right, but the triangle itself does not change in size or shape.\n\n2. **Reflection**: In this transformation, a figure is flipped over a specific line, known as the line of reflection, creating a mirror image of the original figure. For instance, if you reflect a point across the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the point changes sign while the x-coordinate remains the same. This results in a symmetrical image relative to the line of reflection.\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation involves turning a figure around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation, by a certain angle. The distance from the center of rotation to any point in the figure remains constant, and the shape and size of the figure do not change. For example, rotating a triangle 90 degrees clockwise around its centroid will reposition the triangle while maintaining its dimensions.\n\nThese transformations can be combined to create more complex movements and changes in geometric figures. Other transformations, such as dilation and shear, also exist but are not among the three primary types.
