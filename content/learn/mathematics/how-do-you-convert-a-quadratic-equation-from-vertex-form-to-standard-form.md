    How do you convert a quadratic equation from vertex form to standard form?
answer: >-
    To convert a quadratic equation from vertex form to standard form, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertex Form**: The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Expand the Squared Term**: Start by expanding the expression \((x - h)^2\):\n   $$\n   (x - h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2\n   $$\n\n3. **Multiply by $a$**: Next, multiply the expanded expression by $a$:\n   $$\n   a(x - h)^2 = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2\n   $$\n\n4. **Add $k$**: Finally, add $k$ to the expression:\n   $$\n   y = ax^2 - 2ahx + (ah^2 + k)\n   $$\n\n5. **Standard Form**: The resulting equation is now in standard form, which is:\n   $$\n   y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   $$\n   where $b = -2ah$ and $c = ah^2 + k$.\n\n### Example\nLet's convert the vertex form \(y = 2(x - 3)^2 + 1\) to standard form:\n\n1. Expand \((x - 3)^2\):\n   $$\n   (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n   $$\n\n2. Multiply by $2$:\n   $$\n   2(x - 3)^2 = 2(x^2 - 6x + 9) = 2x^2 - 12x + 18\n   $$\n\n3. Add $1$:\n   $$\n   y = 2x^2 - 12x + 18 + 1 = 2x^2 - 12x + 19\n   $$\n\nThus, the standard form of the quadratic equation is:\n$$\ny = 2x^2 - 12x + 19\n$$\n\nThis process allows you to convert any quadratic equation from vertex form to standard form effectively.
