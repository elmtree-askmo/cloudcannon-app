    How is the distance from a line measured in the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To measure the distance from a line in the coordinate plane, we typically focus on the shortest distance from a specific point to the line. This distance is represented by a perpendicular segment from the point to the line, which is the minimum distance between the two.\n\nThe formula to calculate the distance $d$ from a point \((x_0, y_0)\) to a line given by the equation $Ax + By + C = 0$ is:\n\n$$\nd = \frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\n$$\n\n### Explanation of the Formula:\n- **$A$, $B$, and $C$** are the coefficients from the line's equation.\n- **\((x_0, y_0)\)** are the coordinates of the point from which you want to measure the distance.\n- The numerator $|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|$ calculates the absolute value of the line equation evaluated at the point, which gives the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.\n- The denominator $\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$ normalizes this distance by the length of the normal vector to the line, ensuring that the distance is correctly scaled.\n\n### Example:\nIf you have a line represented by the equation $2x + 3y - 6 = 0$ and you want to find the distance from the point \((1, 2)\) to this line, you would substitute $A = 2$, $B = 3$, $C = -6$, $x_0 = 1$, and $y_0 = 2$ into the formula:\n\n1. Calculate the numerator:\n   $$|2(1) + 3(2) - 6| = |2 + 6 - 6| = |2| = 2$$\n\n2. Calculate the denominator:\n   $$\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}$$\n\n3. Finally, compute the distance:\n   $$d = \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}$$\n\nThis gives you the shortest distance from the point to the line.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe distance from a point to a line in the coordinate plane is a fundamental concept in geometry, and the formula provided allows for precise calculation of this distance.
