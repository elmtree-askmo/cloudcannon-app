    To identify intervals of increase and decrease in a function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definitions**:\n   - A function \( f(x) \) is **increasing** on an interval if, for any two points \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) in that interval, where \( x_1 < x_2 \), it holds that \( f(x_1) < f(x_2) \). This means that as you move from left to right along the x-axis, the y-values of the function are rising.\n   - Conversely, a function is **decreasing** on an interval if \( f(x_1) > f(x_2) \) for \( x_1 < x_2 \), indicating that the y-values are falling as you move right.\n\n2. **Use the First Derivative**:\n   - The first derivative of a function, denoted as \( f'(x) \), provides critical information about the function's behavior. To find intervals of increase and decrease:\n     - Calculate the first derivative \( f'(x) \).\n     - Identify the **critical points** by setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) and solving for \( x \). These points are where the function may change from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.\n     - Additionally, check where \( f'(x) \) is undefined, as these points can also indicate changes in behavior.\n\n3. **Test Intervals**:\n   - Divide the x-axis into intervals based on the critical points found in the previous step.\n   - Choose a test point from each interval and evaluate the sign of \( f'(x) \) at that point:\n     - If \( f'(x) > 0 \) in an interval, the function is increasing on that interval.\n     - If \( f'(x) < 0 \) in an interval, the function is decreasing on that interval.\n\n4. **Example**:\n   Consider the function \( f(x) = -x^3 + 3x^2 + 9 \):\n   - First, compute the derivative:\n     $$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 6x $$\n   - Set the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n     $$ -3x^2 + 6x = 0 $$\n     $$ 3x(x - 2) = 0 $$\n     This gives critical points at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).\n   - Test intervals: Choose test points in the intervals \( (-\infty, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \):\n     - For \( x < 0 \) (e.g., \( x = -1 \)): \( f'(-1) = 9 > 0 \) (increasing)\n     - For \( 0 < x < 2 \) (e.g., \( x = 1 \)): \( f'(1) = 3 > 0 \) (increasing)\n     - For \( x > 2 \) (e.g., \( x = 3 \)): \( f'(3) = -3 < 0 \) (decreasing)\n   - Conclusion: The function is increasing on the intervals \( (-\infty, 0) \) and \( (0, 2) \), and decreasing on \( (2, \infty) \).\n\n5. **Graphical Analysis**:\n   - You can also analyze the graph of the function to visually identify intervals of increase and decrease. Look for sections where the graph slopes upwards (increasing) or downwards (decreasing).\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically determine the intervals where a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.
