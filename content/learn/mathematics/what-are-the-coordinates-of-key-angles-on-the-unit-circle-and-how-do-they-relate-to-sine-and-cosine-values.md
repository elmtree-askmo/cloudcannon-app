answer: >-
    The coordinates of key angles on the unit circle are essential for understanding the relationships between angles and their sine and cosine values. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of one, centered at the origin of a coordinate system. Each point on the unit circle corresponds to an angle $\theta$, measured from the positive x-axis, and can be expressed as the coordinates $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$.\n\nHere are the coordinates for some key angles in both degrees and radians:\n\n| Angle (Degrees) | Angle (Radians) | Coordinates $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$ |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 0°               | 0                | (1, 0)                                     |\n| 30°              | $\frac{\pi}{6}$  | $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ |\n| 45°              | $\frac{\pi}{4}$  | $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 60°              | $\frac{\pi}{3}$  | $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 90°              | $\frac{\pi}{2}$  | (0, 1)                                     |\n| 120°             | $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ | $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 135°             | $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ | $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 150°             | $\frac{5\pi}{6}$ | $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ |\n| 180°             | $\pi$            | (-1, 0)                                    |\n| 210°             | $\frac{7\pi}{6}$ | $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right)$ |\n| 225°             | $\frac{5\pi}{4}$ | $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 240°             | $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ | $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 270°             | $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ | (0, -1)                                    |\n| 300°             | $\frac{5\pi}{3}$ | $\left(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 315°             | $\frac{7\pi}{4}$ | $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$ |\n| 330°             | $\frac{11\pi}{6}$| $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right)$ |\n| 360°             | $2\pi$           | (1, 0)                                     |\n\n### Relationship to Sine and Cosine Values\nThe coordinates of these angles directly represent the sine and cosine values:\n- The x-coordinate corresponds to the cosine value: $\cos(\theta)$.\n- The y-coordinate corresponds to the sine value: $\sin(\theta)$.\n\nFor example:\n- At 30° (or $\frac{\pi}{6}$ radians), the coordinates are $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$, which means $\cos(30°) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\sin(30°) = \frac{1}{2}$.\n- At 90° (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians), the coordinates are (0, 1), indicating $\cos(90°) = 0$ and $\sin(90°) = 1$.\n\n### Reference Angles\nReference angles are the acute angles formed by the terminal side of an angle and the horizontal axis. They help in determining the sine and cosine values for angles in different quadrants. For instance, the sine and cosine values of angles in the second quadrant can be derived from their reference angles in the first quadrant.\n\n### Quadrants and Signs of Trigonometric Functions\nThe signs of sine and cosine values depend on the quadrant in which the angle lies:\n- **First Quadrant (0° to 90°)**: All functions are positive.\n- **Second Quadrant (90° to 180°)**: Sine is positive, cosine is negative.\n- **Third Quadrant (180° to 270°)**: Tangent is positive, sine and cosine are negative.\n- **Fourth Quadrant (270° to 360°)**: Cosine is positive, sine is negative.\n\nUnderstanding these coordinates and their relationships to sine and cosine values is fundamental in trigonometry, especially when graphing periodic functions and solving trigonometric equations.
