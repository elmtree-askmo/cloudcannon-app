    What are the formulas for calculating the surface area of right rectangular prisms?
answer: >-
    The surface area of a right rectangular prism can be calculated using specific formulas that account for its dimensions: length (l), width (w), and height (h). There are two main types of surface area calculations for a right rectangular prism: total surface area and lateral surface area.\n\n1. **Total Surface Area (TSA)**:\n   The formula for calculating the total surface area of a right rectangular prism is given by:\n   $$\n   \text{Total Surface Area} = 2(lw + lh + wh) \text{ square units}\n   $$\n   This formula accounts for all six faces of the prism, where:\n   - $lw$ is the area of the bottom and top faces,\n   - $lh$ is the area of the front and back faces,\n   - $wh$ is the area of the left and right faces.\n\n2. **Lateral Surface Area (LSA)**:\n   The formula for calculating the lateral surface area, which excludes the top and bottom faces, is:\n   $$\n   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2(l + w)h \text{ square units}\n   $$\n   This formula sums the areas of the four vertical faces of the prism.\n\n### Example Calculation\nFor instance, if you have a right rectangular prism with the following dimensions:\n- Length (l) = 8 inches\n- Width (w) = 5 inches\n- Height (h) = 7 inches\n\nYou can calculate the total surface area as follows:\n$$\n\text{TSA} = 2(8 \times 5 + 8 \times 7 + 5 \times 7) = 2(40 + 56 + 35) = 2(131) = 262 \text{ square inches}\n$$\n\nAnd the lateral surface area:\n$$\n\text{LSA} = 2(8 + 5) \times 7 = 2(13) \times 7 = 26 \times 7 = 182 \text{ square inches}\n$$\n\nThese formulas are essential for various applications in geometry, including real-world scenarios such as packaging, construction, and design, where understanding the surface area is crucial for material estimation and cost analysis.
