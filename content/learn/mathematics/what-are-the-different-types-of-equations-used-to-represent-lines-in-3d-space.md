    What are the different types of equations used to represent lines in 3-D space?
answer: >-
    In three-dimensional space, there are several types of equations used to represent lines. The most common forms include:\n\n1. **Parametric Equations**: A line can be expressed using parametric equations, which describe the coordinates of points on the line as functions of a parameter $ t $. If a line passes through a point \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) and is parallel to a direction vector \( (a, b, c) \), the parametric equations are given by:\n   $$\n   x = x_0 + at \\\n   y = y_0 + bt \\\n   z = z_0 + ct\n   $$\n\n2. **Vector Form**: The line can also be represented in vector notation. If $ \vec{p}_0 $ is the position vector of a point on the line and $ \vec{d} $ is the direction vector, the equation of the line can be written as:\n   $$\n   \vec{p}(t) = \vec{p}_0 + \vec{d}t\n   $$\n\n3. **Symmetric Equations**: From the parametric equations, we can derive symmetric equations. If the direction ratios are non-zero, the symmetric form of the line can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}\n   $$\n\n4. **Intersection of Planes**: A line can also be described as the intersection of two planes. If we have two planes defined by equations $ a_1x + b_1y + c_1z = d_1 $ and $ a_2x + b_2y + c_2z = d_2 $, the line of intersection can be represented as:\n   $$\n   \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : a_1x + b_1y + c_1z = d_1 \text{ and } a_2x + b_2y + c_2z = d_2\}\n   $$\n\nThese forms provide different ways to represent lines in three-dimensional geometry, depending on the information available (such as points on the line or direction vectors).
