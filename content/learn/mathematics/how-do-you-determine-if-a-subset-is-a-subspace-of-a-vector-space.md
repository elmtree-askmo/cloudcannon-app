    How do you determine if a subset is a subspace of a vector space?
answer: >-
    To determine if a subset $ W $ of a vector space $ V $ is a subspace, you must verify that it satisfies three essential conditions:\n\n1. **Non-emptiness**: The subset $ W $ must contain the zero vector of the vector space $ V $. This is crucial because the zero vector is a fundamental element in any vector space.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition**: For any two vectors $ u, v \in W $, their sum $ u + v $ must also be in $ W $. This means that adding any two vectors from the subset should yield another vector that is still within the subset.\n\n3. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: For any vector $ u \in W $ and any scalar $ c $ (from the field over which the vector space is defined), the product $ c \cdot u $ must also be in $ W $. This ensures that scaling a vector in the subset by any scalar results in another vector that remains in the subset.\n\nIf all three conditions are satisfied, then $ W $ is a subspace of $ V $. \n\n### Example\nConsider the set of all vectors in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ that lie on the line defined by $ y = mx $ (where $ m $ is a constant). This set is a subspace of $ \mathbb{R}^2 $ because:\n- It contains the zero vector (when $ x = 0 $, $ y = 0 $).\n- It is closed under addition (the sum of any two vectors on the line will also lie on the line).\n- It is closed under scalar multiplication (scaling a vector on the line will still yield a vector on the line).\n\nIn summary, to check if a subset is a subspace, ensure it contains the zero vector, is closed under addition, and is closed under scalar multiplication.
