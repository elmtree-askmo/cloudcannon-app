    How is the average rate of change calculated for a function?
answer: >-
    The average rate of change of a function over a specific interval $[a, b]$ is a measure of how much the function's output changes in relation to the change in its input over that interval. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nIn this formula:\n- \(f(x)\) represents the function.\n- $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints of the interval on the x-axis.\n- \(f(a)\) is the value of the function at $x = a$.\n- \(f(b)\) is the value of the function at $x = b$.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Average Rate of Change:\n1. **Identify the Interval**: Determine the values of $a$ and $b$ for the interval you are interested in.\n2. **Evaluate the Function**: Calculate \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) by substituting $a$ and $b$ into the function.\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Substitute the values of \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) into the average rate of change formula.\n\n### Example:\nSuppose you have a function defined by the points (1, 3) and (4, 15). To find the average rate of change from $x = 1$ to $x = 4$:\n\n1. \(f(1) = 3\)\n2. \(f(4) = 15\)\n3. Substitute into the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{15 - 3}{4 - 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4\n   $$\n\nThis result indicates that, on average, the function increases by 4 units for every 1 unit increase in $x$ over the interval from 1 to 4.\n\n### Applications:\nThe average rate of change can be applied to various types of functions, including linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. It is useful in real-world scenarios, such as calculating average speed, growth rates, or any situation where you need to understand how one quantity changes in relation to another over a specified interval. \n\nIn summary, the average rate of change provides valuable insight into the behavior of functions and is a fundamental concept in function analysis.
