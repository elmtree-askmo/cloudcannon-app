    How is horizontal symmetry defined in geometric figures?
answer: >-
    Horizontal symmetry in geometric figures is defined as the property where a shape can be divided into two identical halves by an imaginary horizontal line. This line runs from left to right (or vice versa) and, when the shape is folded along this line, the two halves will perfectly overlap, appearing as mirror images of each other.\n\nFor example, consider a rectangle or a butterfly shape. If you draw a horizontal line through the center of these shapes, the top half will be a mirror image of the bottom half. This characteristic is what defines the horizontal line of symmetry.\n\nIn summary, a horizontal line of symmetry divides a shape into top and bottom mirror halves, and it is a specific type of symmetry that can be observed in various geometric figures.
