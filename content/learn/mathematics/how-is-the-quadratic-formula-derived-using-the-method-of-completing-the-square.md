    How is the quadratic formula derived using the method of completing the square?
answer: >-
    The quadratic formula is a powerful tool used to find the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation of the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $. The formula is given by:\n\n$$\nx = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n\nTo derive this formula using the method of completing the square, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with the standard form of the quadratic equation**:\n   $$\n   ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   $$\n\n2. **Divide all terms by $ a $** (assuming $ a \neq 0 $) to simplify the equation:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0\n   $$\n\n3. **Rearrange the equation** to isolate the constant term on one side:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}\n   $$\n\n4. **Complete the square** on the left side. To do this, take half of the coefficient of $ x $ (which is $ \frac{b}{a} $), square it, and add it to both sides:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n5. **Rewrite the left side** as a perfect square:\n   $$\n   \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\n   $$\n\n6. **Combine the right side** over a common denominator:\n   $$\n   \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{-4ac + b^2}{4a^2}\n   $$\n\n7. **Take the square root of both sides**:\n   $$\n   x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n\n8. **Isolate $ x $** by subtracting $ \frac{b}{2a} $ from both sides:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n\n9. **Combine the terms** on the right side:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n\nThis final expression is the quadratic formula, which allows us to find the values of $ x $ that satisfy the original quadratic equation. The discriminant $ b^2 - 4ac $ determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex). \n\nThis derivation illustrates the method of completing the square, which is a fundamental technique in algebra.
