    To tackle subtraction word problems effectively, you can follow a systematic approach that involves several key steps. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide:\n\n### Steps to Solve Subtraction Word Problems\n\n1. **Read the Problem Carefully**: Begin by reading the word problem thoroughly to understand the scenario and the information provided. Pay attention to the details and the context.\n\n2. **Identify Key Information**: Look for numbers and keywords that indicate subtraction. Common keywords include "left," "remaining," "gave away," "lost," and "fewer."\n\n3. **Translate the Information**: Convert the words into a mathematical equation. For example, if the problem states that someone has a certain number of items and gives some away, you can express this as:\n   - Total items - Items given away = Remaining items.\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation**: Based on your translation, set up the subtraction equation. For instance, if Sarah had 15 apples and gave away 7, the equation would be:\n   $$ \n   15 - 7 = ? \n   $$\n\n5. **Solve the Equation**: Perform the subtraction to find the answer. Continuing with the example:\n   $$\n   15 - 7 = 8 \n   $$\n   So, Sarah has 8 apples left.\n\n6. **Check Your Work**: After solving, revisit the problem to ensure that your answer makes sense in the context of the question. \n\n### Example Problems\n\n1. **Example 1**: \n   - **Problem**: At the beginning of the day, there were 339 tickets available for the raffle. By the end of the day, all but 54 tickets were sold. How many tickets were sold?\n   - **Solution**: \n     - Total tickets = 339\n     - Tickets remaining = 54\n     - Tickets sold = Total tickets - Tickets remaining\n     $$\n     339 - 54 = 285 \n     $$\n     Thus, 285 tickets were sold.\n\n2. **Example 2**: \n   - **Problem**: Sebastian has 8 pencils and gives away 5 pencils to his friends. How many pencils does he have left?\n   - **Solution**: \n     - Initial pencils = 8\n     - Pencils given away = 5\n     - Pencils left = Initial pencils - Pencils given away\n     $$\n     8 - 5 = 3 \n     $$\n     Therefore, Sebastian has 3 pencils left.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps and practicing with various examples, students can develop a strong understanding of how to approach and solve subtraction word problems. This method not only helps in finding the correct answer but also builds confidence in handling similar problems in the future.
