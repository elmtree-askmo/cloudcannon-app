    To determine the roots of a quadratic equation, you can use several methods. A quadratic equation is typically expressed in the standard form:\n\n$$\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$. The roots of the equation are the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation. Here are the primary methods to find the roots:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula**: The most common method is to use the quadratic formula, which is given by:\n\n$$\nx = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n\nThis formula provides the roots directly, where the term $b^2 - 4ac$ is known as the discriminant. The nature of the roots can be determined based on the value of the discriminant:\n   - If $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, there is one real root (a repeated root).\n   - If $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, there are two complex roots.\n\n2. **Factoring**: If the quadratic can be factored, you can express it as a product of two binomials:\n\n$$\n(ax + m)(bx + n) = 0\n$$\n\nBy setting each factor equal to zero, you can solve for $x$. This method is often quicker but requires that the quadratic be factorable.\n\n3. **Completing the Square**: This method involves rearranging the equation into a perfect square trinomial. The steps are as follows:\n   - Move the constant term to the other side of the equation.\n   - Take half of the coefficient of $x$, square it, and add it to both sides.\n   - Factor the left side and solve for $x$.\n\n4. **Graphical Method**: You can also find the roots by graphing the quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ and identifying the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. These intersection points correspond to the roots of the equation.\n\nEach of these methods can be used depending on the specific quadratic equation and the context in which you are solving it. For example, in practical applications such as sports, understanding the roots can help analyze trajectories and optimize performance.
