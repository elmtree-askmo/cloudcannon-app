    What is the definition of a function and how do you determine its domain and range?
answer: >-
    A function is a mathematical relation that uniquely associates each element from one set (the domain) with exactly one element from another set (the range). In simpler terms, for every input (often denoted as $x$), there is a single output (often denoted as \(f(x)\)). This relationship can be expressed in various forms, such as equations, graphs, or tables.\n\n### Definition of a Function\nA function $f$ can be formally defined as:\n- A set of ordered pairs \((x, f(x))\) such that for every $x$ in the domain, there is a unique \(f(x)\) in the range.\n\n### Determining the Domain\nThe domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (or $x$-values) for which the function is defined. To determine the domain, consider the following:\n1. **Identify Restrictions**: Look for values that would make the function undefined, such as:\n   - Division by zero (e.g., for \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x-3}\), $x$ cannot be 3).\n   - Square roots of negative numbers (e.g., for \(f(x) = \sqrt{x+3}\), $x$ must be $-3$ or greater).\n2. **Set Notation**: Express the domain in interval notation or set notation based on the identified restrictions.\n\n### Determining the Range\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values (or \(f(x)\)-values) that the function can produce. To determine the range:\n1. **Graph the Function**: Often, graphing the function can provide a visual representation of the output values.\n2. **Analyze the Function**: For polynomial functions, consider the behavior as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity. For rational functions, analyze vertical and horizontal asymptotes.\n3. **Use Calculus**: For more complex functions, finding critical points and evaluating limits can help determine the range.\n\n### Example\nFor the function \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\):\n- **Domain**: All real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ or \((-∞, +∞)\), since there are no restrictions.\n- **Range**: All values $y$ such that $y \geq 1$, expressed as \([1, +∞)\), since the minimum value occurs at $x = 0$.\n\nIn summary, a function is a unique mapping from inputs to outputs, and determining its domain and range involves identifying restrictions on inputs and analyzing possible outputs.
