    What is the difference between the outputs of an original function and its transformed version?
answer: >-
    The difference between the outputs of an original function and its transformed version, particularly in the context of reflections, can be understood through the concept of function transformations. When a function undergoes a reflection over the x-axis, the outputs (y-values) of the function are inverted, while the inputs (x-values) remain unchanged.\n\n### Key Points of Reflection Transformation:\n\n1. **Reflection Over the x-axis**: This transformation is represented mathematically as \( y = -f(x) \). In this case, for every point \( (x, f(x)) \) on the original function, the corresponding point on the transformed function will be \( (x, -f(x)) \). This means that the y-values of the reflected function are the opposites of the original function's y-values.\n\n2. **Output Comparison**: To illustrate this, consider a simple function such as \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n   - For $ x = 2 $, the original function gives \( f(2) = 4 \).\n   - The transformed function \( y = -f(x) \) gives \( -f(2) = -4 \).\n   - Thus, the outputs differ by a sign: $ 4 $ (original) vs. $ -4 $ (transformed).\n\n3. **Creating Tables**: A practical way to visualize this transformation is to create tables for both the original function and its reflection. For example, if we evaluate \( f(x) = x^2 \) at several points:\n   - Original Function: \n     - \( f(-2) = 4 \)\n     - \( f(-1) = 1 \)\n     - \( f(0) = 0 \)\n     - \( f(1) = 1 \)\n     - \( f(2) = 4 \)\n   - Reflected Function:\n     - \( -f(-2) = -4 \)\n     - \( -f(-1) = -1 \)\n     - \( -f(0) = 0 \)\n     - \( -f(1) = -1 \)\n     - \( -f(2) = -4 \)\n\n4. **Graphical Representation**: When graphed, the original function \( f(x) = x^2 \) appears as a parabola opening upwards, while the reflected function $ y = -x^2 $ appears as a parabola opening downwards. This visual representation confirms the relationship between the original and transformed outputs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, the primary difference between the outputs of an original function and its transformed version through reflection is that the y-values of the transformed function are the negatives of the original function's y-values. This transformation effectively flips the graph over the x-axis, demonstrating how reflections alter the outputs while keeping the inputs constant.
