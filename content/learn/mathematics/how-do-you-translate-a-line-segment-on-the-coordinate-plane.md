    How do you translate a line segment on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To translate a line segment on the coordinate plane, you follow a systematic process that involves shifting each endpoint of the line segment by a specified vector. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform this translation:\n\n1. **Identify the Endpoints**: Let’s say you have a line segment defined by its endpoints \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \).\n\n2. **Determine the Translation Vector**: A translation vector is typically represented as \( \vec{v} = (a, b) \), where $ a $ is the horizontal shift and $ b $ is the vertical shift.\n\n3. **Apply the Translation**: To translate the endpoints of the line segment, you add the translation vector to each endpoint:\n   - For point $ A $:\n     $$\n     A' = (x_1 + a, y_1 + b)\n     $$\n   - For point $ B $:\n     $$\n     B' = (x_2 + a, y_2 + b)\n     $$\n\n4. **Draw the Translated Line Segment**: After calculating the new coordinates $ A' $ and $ B' $, you can draw the new line segment connecting these two points.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have a line segment with endpoints \( A(2, 3) \) and \( B(4, 5) \), and you want to translate it by the vector \( \vec{v} = (3, -2) \).\n\n1. **Original Endpoints**:\n   - \( A(2, 3) \)\n   - \( B(4, 5) \)\n\n2. **Translation Vector**:\n   - \( \vec{v} = (3, -2) \)\n\n3. **Translated Endpoints**:\n   - For $ A' $:\n     $$\n     A' = (2 + 3, 3 - 2) = (5, 1)\n     $$\n   - For $ B' $:\n     $$\n     B' = (4 + 3, 5 - 2) = (7, 3)\n     $$\n\n4. **New Line Segment**: The translated line segment will now connect points \( A'(5, 1) \) and \( B'(7, 3) \).\n\nThis method of translation maintains the properties of the line segment, such as length and orientation, as it is a rigid motion. The visualization of this transformation can be enhanced using interactive resources like GeoGebra, which allow for dynamic manipulation of geometric figures on the coordinate plane.
