    How do negative exponents differ from positive exponents in terms of calculation?
answer: >-
    Negative exponents differ from positive exponents primarily in how they represent the operation of division rather than multiplication. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Definition**: A negative exponent indicates that the base should be taken as the reciprocal and raised to the absolute value of the exponent. For example, for a base $ a $ and a negative exponent $ -n $:\n   $$ \n   a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n} \n   $$\n   This means that instead of multiplying $ a $ by itself $ n $ times (as with positive exponents), you are effectively dividing 1 by $ a $ multiplied by itself $ n $ times.\n\n2. **Calculation**: When calculating with negative exponents, you can convert them to positive exponents to simplify the process. For instance:\n   - For $ 2^{-3} $:\n     $$\n     2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}\n     $$\n   - Conversely, a positive exponent like $ 2^3 $ is calculated as:\n     $$\n     2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\n     $$\n\n3. **Comparison**: The larger the negative exponent, the smaller the resulting value. For example, $ 2^{-3} $ (which equals $ \frac{1}{8} $) is greater than $ 2^{-6} $ (which equals $ \frac{1}{64} $). This illustrates that negative exponents represent fractions that decrease in value as the exponent becomes more negative.\n\n4. **Reciprocal Relationship**: Negative exponents can also be understood through their reciprocal relationship. For example:\n   - $ 10^{-2} = \frac{1}{10^2} = \frac{1}{100} $\n   - This shows that negative exponents effectively "flip" the base to the denominator of a fraction.\n\nIn summary, negative exponents signify repeated division, while positive exponents signify repeated multiplication. This fundamental difference is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations involving exponents.
