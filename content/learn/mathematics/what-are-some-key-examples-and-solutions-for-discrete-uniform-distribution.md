    What are some key examples and solutions for discrete uniform distribution?
answer: >-
    The discrete uniform distribution is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, characterized by a finite number of outcomes, each of which has an equal probability of occurring. Here are some key examples and solutions related to the discrete uniform distribution:\n\n### Key Examples\n\n1. **Rolling a Die**:\n   - When rolling a fair six-sided die, the possible outcomes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Each outcome has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{6} \). This is a classic example of a discrete uniform distribution where \( n = 6 \).\n\n2. **Selecting a Card from a Deck**:\n   - In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, if you randomly select one card, each card has an equal chance of being selected, which is \( \frac{1}{52} \). This scenario also exemplifies a discrete uniform distribution.\n\n3. **Choosing a Donut**:\n   - Imagine a box containing 12 different donuts. If you randomly select one donut without looking, each donut has an equal probability of being chosen, which is \( \frac{1}{12} \). This is another practical example of a discrete uniform distribution.\n\n4. **Random Number Generation**:\n   - If you generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), each integer has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{10} \). This is a discrete uniform distribution with \( n = 10 \).\n\n### Solutions and Calculations\n\nTo calculate probabilities in a discrete uniform distribution, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\nP(X = x) = \frac{1}{n}\n$$\n\nwhere \( n \) is the total number of outcomes, and \( x \) is any specific outcome.\n\n#### Example Calculation:\n- **Probability of Rolling a Specific Number on a Die**:\n  - If you want to find the probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die:\n  $$\n  P(X = 4) = \frac{1}{6}\n  $$\n\n- **Cumulative Probability**:\n  - If you want to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3:\n  $$\n  P(X \leq 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\n  $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe discrete uniform distribution is a simple yet powerful model for understanding situations where outcomes are equally likely. Its applications range from games of chance, like rolling dice or drawing cards, to various random selection processes in real life. Understanding how to calculate probabilities in this distribution is essential for statistical analysis and decision-making.
