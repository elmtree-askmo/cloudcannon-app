    Rationalizing denominators is an essential technique in algebra that involves eliminating radicals from the denominator of a fraction. Here are the key techniques for rationalizing denominators, particularly when dealing with square roots:\n\n### Techniques for Rationalizing Denominators\n\n1. **Single Radical in the Denominator**:\n   - When the denominator contains a single square root, you can rationalize it by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by that square root. For example:\n     $$\n     \frac{2}{\sqrt{10}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{2\sqrt{10}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{5}\n     $$\n\n2. **Two Terms in the Denominator (Conjugates)**:\n   - When the denominator is a binomial that includes a radical, you can use the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. The conjugate is formed by changing the sign between the two terms. For example, to rationalize:\n     $$\n     \frac{1}{5 + \sqrt{2}}\n     $$\n     Multiply by the conjugate $5 - \sqrt{2}$:\n     $$\n     \frac{1}{5 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{2}}{5 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{2}}{(5 + \sqrt{2})(5 - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{2}}{25 - 2} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{2}}{23}\n     $$\n\n3. **Difference of Squares Formula**:\n   - The difference of squares formula, \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \), is particularly useful when rationalizing denominators with two terms. This formula allows you to eliminate the radical by transforming the denominator into a rational number.\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Example 1**: Rationalizing $ \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} $:\n  $$\n  \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}\n  $$\n\n- **Example 2**: Rationalizing $ \frac{4}{2 + \sqrt{3}} $:\n  $$\n  \frac{4}{2 + \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{4(2 - \sqrt{3})}{(2 + \sqrt{3})(2 - \sqrt{3})} = \frac{8 - 4\sqrt{3}}{4 - 3} = 8 - 4\sqrt{3}\n  $$\n\n### Summary\nRationalizing denominators is a crucial skill in algebra that simplifies expressions and makes them easier to work with. By using the techniques of multiplying by the radical or the conjugate, you can effectively eliminate radicals from the denominator, leading to a more manageable form of the expression. Practicing these techniques will enhance your proficiency in handling expressions involving radicals.
