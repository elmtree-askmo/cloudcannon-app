    How do vertical and horizontal shifts affect the graph of a function?
answer: >-
    Vertical and horizontal shifts are fundamental transformations that affect the graph of a function in specific ways.\n\n### Horizontal Shifts\nA horizontal shift occurs when a constant is added to or subtracted from the input variable $ x $ in the function. The general forms are:\n- \( f(x - h) \) shifts the graph to the right by $ h $ units.\n- \( f(x + h) \) shifts the graph to the left by $ h $ units.\n\nFor example, if we take the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) and transform it to \( g(x) = \sqrt{x - 3} \), the graph of \( g(x) \) will be shifted 3 units to the right compared to the graph of \( f(x) \).\n\n### Vertical Shifts\nA vertical shift occurs when a constant is added to or subtracted from the entire function. The general forms are:\n- \( f(x) + k \) shifts the graph up by $ k $ units.\n- \( f(x) - k \) shifts the graph down by $ k $ units.\n\nFor instance, transforming \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) to \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} + 2 \) results in the graph of \( g(x) \) being shifted 2 units upwards compared to the graph of \( f(x) \).\n\n### Summary of Effects\n- **Horizontal shifts** change the $ x $-coordinates of points on the graph, effectively moving the graph left or right without altering its shape.\n- **Vertical shifts** change the $ y $-coordinates of points on the graph, moving the graph up or down while maintaining its original shape.\n\n### Example\nConsider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \):\n- The function \( g(x) = (x - 2)^2 \) represents a horizontal shift to the right by 2 units.\n- The function \( h(x) = x^2 + 3 \) represents a vertical shift upwards by 3 units.\n\nThese transformations are crucial for understanding how to manipulate and graph functions effectively, as they allow for the adjustment of the function's position on the Cartesian plane without changing its fundamental characteristics.
