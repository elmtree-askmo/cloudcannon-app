    What is the standard form of a quadratic function, and how is it graphically represented?
answer: >-
    The standard form of a quadratic function is expressed as:\n\n$$\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n$$\n\nwhere $ a \neq 0 $. In this form, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants, and the graph of the function is a parabola.\n\n### Graphical Representation\n\n1. **Shape of the Graph**: The graph of a quadratic function is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. The direction in which the parabola opens depends on the value of $ a $:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards.\n   - If $ a < 0 $, the parabola opens downwards.\n\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is a crucial point that represents the maximum or minimum value of the function. To find the vertex, you can use the following steps:\n   - Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula:\n     $$\n     x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n     $$\n   - Substitute this x-value back into the quadratic equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate:\n     $$\n     y = a\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) + c\n     $$\n   The vertex is thus given by the point \((h, k)\), where $ h = -\frac{b}{2a} $ and $ k $ is the corresponding y-value.\n\n3. **Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, given by the equation:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n\n4. **Plotting Points**: To graph the quadratic function, you can plot additional points by choosing values for $ x $ and calculating the corresponding $ y $ values. This helps in accurately sketching the shape of the parabola.\n\n5. **Intercepts**: The y-intercept can be found by evaluating the function at $ x = 0 $:\n   $$\n   y = c\n   $$\n   The x-intercepts (if they exist) can be found by solving the equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ using the quadratic formula:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   $$\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the standard form of a quadratic function allows for easy identification of key features such as the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts, which are essential for graphing the function accurately. The resulting graph is a parabola that can open either upwards or downwards depending on the coefficient $ a $.
