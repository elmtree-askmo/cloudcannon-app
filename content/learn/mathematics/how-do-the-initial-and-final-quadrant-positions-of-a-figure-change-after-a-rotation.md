    How do the initial and final quadrant positions of a figure change after a rotation?
answer: >-
    The initial and final quadrant positions of a figure after a rotation depend on the angle of rotation and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) in which the rotation is performed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how these transformations affect the quadrant positions:\n\n1. **180-Degree Rotation**:\n   - A 180-degree rotation, whether clockwise or counterclockwise, will move a figure from one quadrant to the opposite quadrant. For example:\n     - If a figure starts in Quadrant I (where both x and y coordinates are positive), after a 180-degree rotation, it will end up in Quadrant III (where both x and y coordinates are negative).\n     - Similarly, a figure in Quadrant II will move to Quadrant IV, and a figure in Quadrant III will move to Quadrant I.\n\n2. **90-Degree Rotation**:\n   - A 90-degree counterclockwise rotation will shift the figure to the next quadrant in the counterclockwise direction:\n     - From Quadrant I to Quadrant II\n     - From Quadrant II to Quadrant III\n     - From Quadrant III to Quadrant IV\n     - From Quadrant IV to Quadrant I\n   - Conversely, a 90-degree clockwise rotation will shift the figure to the next quadrant in the clockwise direction:\n     - From Quadrant I to Quadrant IV\n     - From Quadrant II to Quadrant I\n     - From Quadrant III to Quadrant II\n     - From Quadrant IV to Quadrant III\n\n3. **270-Degree Rotation**:\n   - A 270-degree counterclockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Therefore, it will also move the figure to the next quadrant in the clockwise direction.\n\n4. **General Rules**:\n   - The transformation rules for rotations can be summarized as follows:\n     - For a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation: \n       - The coordinates change from $(x, y)$ to $(-y, x)$.\n     - For a 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n       - The coordinates change from $(x, y)$ to $(y, -x)$.\n     - For a 180-degree rotation:\n       - The coordinates change from $(x, y)$ to $(-x, -y)$.\n\nUnderstanding these transformations allows for predicting the final positions of figures after rotation, which is crucial in geometry. The congruence of the pre-image and image remains intact, meaning the size and shape of the figure do not change, only its orientation and position on the coordinate plane.
