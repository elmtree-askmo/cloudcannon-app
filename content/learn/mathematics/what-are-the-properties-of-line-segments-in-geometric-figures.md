    What are the properties of line segments in geometric figures?
answer: >-
    In geometry, line segments are fundamental components that possess several key properties. Here are the main properties of line segments:\n\n1. **Definition**: A line segment is a part of a straight line that is bounded by two distinct endpoints. It contains every point on the line that lies between these endpoints. This makes it a finite length, unlike a line which extends infinitely in both directions.\n\n2. **Length**: The length of a line segment can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. If the endpoints of the line segment are given by coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), the length $L$ of the line segment is given by:\n   $$\n   L = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   $$\n\n3. **Closed and Open Segments**: A line segment can be classified as a closed segment, which includes both endpoints, or an open segment, which excludes the endpoints. For example, the closed segment $[A, B]$ includes points A and B, while the open segment \((A, B)\) does not.\n\n4. **Collinearity**: Points that lie on the same line segment are said to be collinear. This property is essential in determining whether a set of points can form a line segment.\n\n5. **Midpoint**: The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. The coordinates of the midpoint $M$ of a line segment with endpoints \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   M = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\n   $$\n\n6. **Direction**: A line segment has a specific direction from one endpoint to the other. This direction can be represented as a vector, which is useful in various applications, including physics and computer graphics.\n\n7. **Congruence**: Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. This property is crucial in geometric constructions and proofs.\n\n8. **Intersection**: Line segments can intersect with other line segments or lines. The point of intersection can be determined using geometric principles or algebraic methods.\n\n9. **Applications**: Line segments are the building blocks of polygons and other geometric figures. For example, a triangle consists of three line segments, while a square is formed by four line segments.\n\nUnderstanding these properties of line segments is essential for exploring more complex geometric concepts and figures. They serve as the foundation for various geometric constructions and theorems.
