    How are division and multiplication prioritized in the order of operations?
answer: >-
    In mathematics, the order of operations is a set of rules that dictates the sequence in which different operations should be performed to ensure consistent and accurate results. The commonly used acronym for remembering this order is PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\n- **P**arentheses\n- **E**xponents\n- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)\n- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)\n\nWhen it comes to multiplication and division, they are treated with equal priority. This means that when you encounter both operations in an expression, you perform them in the order they appear from left to right. For example, in the expression:\n\n$$\n8 \div 4 \times 2\n$$\n\nYou would first divide 8 by 4, which equals 2, and then multiply that result by 2, giving you a final answer of 4.\n\nThis left-to-right approach applies to both multiplication and division, as well as addition and subtraction. Therefore, it is crucial to follow the order of operations to avoid errors in calculations. If you were to calculate the expression incorrectly by prioritizing multiplication over division, you would arrive at a different and incorrect result. \n\nIn summary, multiplication and division are prioritized equally in the order of operations, and you should perform them as they occur from left to right in the expression.
