    How do you convert coordinates from Cartesian to polar systems?
answer: >-
    To convert coordinates from the Cartesian system (x, y) to the polar system (r, θ), you can use the following formulas:\n\n1. **Radial Coordinate (r)**: This represents the distance from the origin to the point and is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   $$\n   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   $$\n\n2. **Angular Coordinate (θ)**: This represents the angle formed with the positive x-axis and can be calculated using the arctangent function:\n   $$\n   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\n   $$\n\n### Example Conversion\nFor example, to convert the Cartesian coordinates (3, 4) to polar coordinates:\n\n1. Calculate $ r $:\n   $$\n   r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\n   $$\n\n2. Calculate $ \theta $:\n   $$\n   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians} \text{ (or } 53.13^\circ\text{)}\n   $$\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are approximately \( (5, 0.93) \) or \( (5, 53.13^\circ) \).\n\n### Important Notes\n- The angle $ \theta $ should be adjusted based on the quadrant in which the point (x, y) lies:\n  - Quadrant I: $ 0 \leq \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} $\n  - Quadrant II: $ \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi $\n  - Quadrant III: $ -\pi < \theta < -\frac{\pi}{2} $\n  - Quadrant IV: $ -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < 0 $\n\n- The conversion is applicable only in a 2D space. For 3D coordinates, cylindrical or spherical coordinates would be used instead.\n\nThis method is essential in various fields, including engineering, physics, and computer graphics, where different coordinate systems are utilized for analysis and visualization.
