answer: >-
    Here are some common mathematical formulas for calculating the area and volume of various geometric shapes:\n\n### Area Formulas\n\n1. **Circle**: \n   - Area $ A = \pi r^2 $\n   - Where $ r $ is the radius of the circle.\n\n2. **Rectangle**: \n   - Area $ A = l \times w $\n   - Where $ l $ is the length and $ w $ is the width.\n\n3. **Square**: \n   - Area $ A = s^2 $\n   - Where $ s $ is the length of one side.\n\n4. **Triangle**: \n   - Area $ A = \frac{1}{2} b h $\n   - Where $ b $ is the base and $ h $ is the height.\n   - Alternatively, if the side lengths $ a, b, c $ are known, you can use Heron's formula:\n   $$ \n   A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \n   $$\n   Where $ s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} $ is the semi-perimeter.\n\n5. **Trapezoid**: \n   - Area \( A = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h \)\n   - Where $ b_1 $ and $ b_2 $ are the lengths of the two parallel sides and $ h $ is the height.\n\n6. **Ellipse**: \n   - Area $ A = \pi a b $\n   - Where $ a $ and $ b $ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.\n\n### Volume Formulas\n\n1. **Cube**: \n   - Volume $ V = s^3 $\n   - Where $ s $ is the length of an edge.\n\n2. **Rectangular Prism (Cuboid)**: \n   - Volume $ V = l \times w \times h $\n   - Where $ l $ is the length, $ w $ is the width, and $ h $ is the height.\n\n3. **Cylinder**: \n   - Volume $ V = \pi r^2 h $\n   - Where $ r $ is the radius of the base and $ h $ is the height.\n\n4. **Cone**: \n   - Volume $ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h $\n   - Where $ r $ is the radius of the base and $ h $ is the height.\n\n5. **Sphere**: \n   - Volume $ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $\n   - Where $ r $ is the radius.\n\n6. **Pyramid**: \n   - Volume $ V = \frac{1}{3} B h $\n   - Where $ B $ is the area of the base and $ h $ is the height.\n\n7. **Hemispherical Volume**: \n   - Volume $ V = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3 $\n   - Where $ r $ is the radius.\n\nThese formulas are essential for calculating the area and volume of common geometric shapes in various applications, from basic geometry to more complex engineering and architectural designs.
