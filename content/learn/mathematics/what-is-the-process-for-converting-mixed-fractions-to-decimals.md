    What is the process for converting mixed fractions to decimals?
answer: >-
    To convert mixed fractions to decimals, you can follow one of two methods:\n\n### Method 1: Convert to an Improper Fraction\n1. **Convert the Mixed Fraction to an Improper Fraction**: Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fractional part and add the numerator. This sum becomes the new numerator, while the denominator remains the same. The formula for this conversion is:\n   $$ \n   n + \frac{p}{q} = \frac{nq + p}{q} \n   $$\n   For example, to convert $3 \frac{1}{4}$ to an improper fraction:\n   - Multiply: $3 \times 4 = 12$\n   - Add the numerator: $12 + 1 = 13$\n   - So, $3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}$.\n\n2. **Divide the Numerator by the Denominator**: Now, divide the new numerator by the denominator to get the decimal form:\n   $$\n   \frac{13}{4} = 3.25\n   $$\n\n### Method 2: Convert the Fractional Part Directly\n1. **Keep the Whole Number Part**: Leave the whole number part of the mixed fraction as is.\n\n2. **Convert the Fractional Part to a Decimal**: Divide the numerator of the fractional part by its denominator. For example, for $3 \frac{1}{4}$:\n   - Divide: $1 \div 4 = 0.25$.\n\n3. **Add the Decimal to the Whole Number**: Finally, add the decimal obtained from the fractional part to the whole number:\n   $$\n   3 + 0.25 = 3.25\n   $$\n\nBoth methods will yield the same result, allowing you to convert mixed fractions to their decimal equivalents effectively.
