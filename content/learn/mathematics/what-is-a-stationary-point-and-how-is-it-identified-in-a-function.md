    A stationary point of a function is where the derivative is zero or undefined, indicating the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. Identifying these points helps analyze local maxima and minima.

    What is a stationary point, and how is it identified in a function?
answer: >-
    A stationary point of a function is a point at which the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. This occurs when the derivative of the function, denoted as \( f'(x) \), is equal to zero or where the derivative is undefined. At these points, the tangent line to the function is horizontal, indicating that the function may have a local maximum, local minimum, or a point of inflection.\n\nTo identify stationary points for a single-variable function \( y = f(x) \), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Derivative**: Find the derivative \( f'(x) \) of the function.\n2. **Set the Derivative to Zero**: Solve the equation \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find the values of $ x $ where the slope of the tangent is zero.\n3. **Check for Undefined Derivatives**: Identify any points where the derivative does not exist, as these can also be stationary points.\n\n### Example\nConsider the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). \n\n1. **Calculate the Derivative**:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 2x - 4\n   $$\n\n2. **Set the Derivative to Zero**:\n   $$\n   2x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 2\n   $$\n   Thus, $ x = 2 $ is a stationary point.\n\n3. **Check for Undefined Derivatives**: In this case, the derivative \( f'(x) \) is defined for all $ x $, so there are no additional stationary points from this step.\n\nIn summary, stationary points are critical for analyzing the behavior of functions, particularly in determining local maxima and minima.
