    How are sum and difference formulas applied in trigonometry?
answer: >-
    The sum and difference formulas in trigonometry are essential tools for calculating the values of trigonometric functions at specific angles, particularly when those angles can be expressed as the sum or difference of standard angles such as 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, and 180°. These formulas allow us to break down complex angles into simpler components, making it easier to find their sine, cosine, or tangent values.\n\n### Key Formulas\n\n1. **Sine Sum and Difference Formulas**:\n   - For the sum of two angles:\n     $$ \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B $$\n   - For the difference of two angles:\n     $$ \sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B $$\n\n2. **Cosine Sum and Difference Formulas**:\n   - For the sum of two angles:\n     $$ \cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B $$\n   - For the difference of two angles:\n     $$ \cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B $$\n\n3. **Tangent Sum and Difference Formulas**:\n   - For the sum of two angles:\n     $$ \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B} $$\n   - For the difference of two angles:\n     $$ \tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B} $$\n\n### Applications\n\nThese formulas are particularly useful in various mathematical contexts, including:\n\n- **Evaluating Trigonometric Functions**: For example, to find $\cos(15^\circ)$, we can express 15° as $45^\circ - 30^\circ$ and apply the cosine difference formula:\n  $$ \cos(15^\circ) = \cos(45^\circ - 30^\circ) = \cos 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ $$\n\n- **Solving Trigonometric Equations**: The sum and difference formulas can simplify complex trigonometric equations, making them easier to solve.\n\n- **Verifying Identities**: These formulas are often used in proofs and to verify trigonometric identities.\n\n- **Real-World Applications**: The principles behind these formulas have practical applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics, where angles and distances need to be calculated accurately.\n\nIn summary, the sum and difference formulas in trigonometry are powerful tools that facilitate the evaluation of trigonometric functions, the solving of equations, and the verification of identities, making them fundamental concepts in the study of geometry and trigonometry.
