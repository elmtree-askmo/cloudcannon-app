    What are the probabilities of different genotypes in an ideal population?
answer: >-
    In an ideal population, the probabilities of different genotypes can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which provides a mathematical framework for understanding the genetic composition of a population under certain conditions. The principle states that allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences, such as selection, mutation, migration, and genetic drift.\n\nFor a population with two alleles, designated as A (dominant) and a (recessive), the frequencies of the alleles can be represented as follows:\n\n- Let \( p \) be the frequency of the dominant allele (A).\n- Let \( q \) be the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n\nAccording to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expected genotype frequencies can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\n- The frequency of homozygous dominant individuals (AA) is given by \( p^2 \).\n- The frequency of heterozygous individuals (Aa) is given by \( 2pq \).\n- The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals (aa) is given by \( q^2 \).\n\nThese frequencies must sum to one:\n\n$$\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n$$\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, if we know that 4% of the population is homozygous recessive (aa), we can set \( q^2 = 0.04 \). From this, we can calculate \( q \):\n\n$$\nq = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2\n$$\n\nSince \( p + q = 1 \), we can find \( p \):\n\n$$\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected genotype frequencies:\n\n- Frequency of AA: \n$$\np^2 = (0.8)^2 = 0.64\n$$\n- Frequency of Aa: \n$$\n2pq = 2 \times 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.32\n$$\n- Frequency of aa: \n$$\nq^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04\n$$\n\nThus, in this ideal population, the expected genotype frequencies would be approximately 64% homozygous dominant (AA), 32% heterozygous (Aa), and 4% homozygous recessive (aa).\n\nThese calculations assume that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which requires that the population is large, mating is random, there is no migration, no mutation, and no selection. If these conditions are met, the genotype frequencies can be reliably predicted using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.
