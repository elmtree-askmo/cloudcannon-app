    How are composed functions constructed and what are their properties?
answer: >-
    Composite functions are constructed by taking the output of one function and using it as the input for another function. For two functions, \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), the composite function can be denoted as \( f(g(x)) \) or \( g(f(x)) \). The order in which the functions are composed is crucial, as \( f(g(x)) \) may not be equal to \( g(f(x)) \).\n\n### Construction of Composite Functions\nTo construct a composite function, follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the Functions**: Start with two functions, \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).\n2. **Apply the Inner Function**: First, apply the inner function \( g(x) \) to the input $ x $.\n3. **Apply the Outer Function**: Next, take the output from \( g(x) \) and use it as the input for the outer function $ f $. This results in the composite function \( f(g(x)) \).\n\nFor example, if \( f(x) = 2x \) and \( g(x) = x + 3 \), then:\n$$\nf(g(x)) = f(x + 3) = 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6.\n$$\n\n### Properties of Composite Functions\nComposite functions exhibit several important properties:\n\n1. **Associative Property**: The composition of functions is associative. This means that for three functions $ f $, $ g $, and $ h $:\n   $$\n   f(g(h(x))) = (f \circ g) \circ h(x).\n   $$\n\n2. **Identity Function**: The identity function \( I(x) \) has the property that when composed with any function \( f(x) \), it results in \( f(x) \) itself:\n   $$\n   (f \circ I)(x) = f(x).\n   $$\n\n3. **Inverse Functions**: The inverse of the composition of two functions is equal to the composition of their inverses:\n   $$\n   (f \circ g)^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ f^{-1}.\n   $$\n\n4. **One-to-One and Onto Functions**: \n   - The composition of two one-to-one functions is also one-to-one.\n   - The composition of two onto functions is also onto.\n\n5. **Domain Considerations**: The domain of the composite function \( f(g(x)) \) is determined by the range of the inner function \( g(x) \) and the domain of the outer function \( f(x) \). \n\n### Applications\nComposite functions are widely used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and economics, to model complex processes where multiple functions interact. Understanding how to construct and evaluate composite functions is essential for solving real-world problems and for further studies in mathematics.\n\nIn summary, composite functions are a fundamental concept in algebra that allows for the combination of multiple functions into a single function, with specific properties that govern their behavior and application.
