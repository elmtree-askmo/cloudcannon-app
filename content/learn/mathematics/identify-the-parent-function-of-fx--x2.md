    Identify the parent function of f(x) = x^2.
answer: >-
    The parent function of \( f(x) = x^2 \) is indeed the quadratic function, which is represented as \( f(x) = x^2 \). This function is characterized by its graph, which is a parabola that opens upwards with its vertex located at the origin (0, 0). \n\nKey characteristics of the parent function \( f(x) = x^2 \) include:\n\n1. **Shape**: The graph is a parabola.\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex is at the point (0, 0).\n3. **Direction**: The parabola opens upwards.\n4. **Symmetry**: The graph is symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nUnderstanding this parent function is essential for graphing and analyzing other quadratic functions, as all transformations (such as vertical shifts, horizontal shifts, reflections, and stretches) are based on this fundamental shape. \n\nIn summary, the parent function for \( f(x) = x^2 \) is \( f(x) = x^2 \), which serves as the simplest form of quadratic functions from which all other variations can be derived.
