    What is the result of multiplying two negative numbers?
answer: >-
    When multiplying two negative numbers, the result is always a positive number. This can be understood through several mathematical concepts and properties.\n\n1. **Cancellation of Negative Signs**: The fundamental reason behind this is that the negative signs cancel each other out. For example, if we take two negative numbers, say -4 and -3, we can express their multiplication as:\n   $$\n   -4 \times -3 = (-1 \times 4) \times (-1 \times 3) = (4 \times 3) = 12\n   $$\n   Here, the two negative signs (from -1) cancel each other, resulting in a positive product.\n\n2. **Concept of Opposite Operations**: Multiplication can be viewed as repeated addition. When you multiply two negative numbers, you are essentially adding a negative quantity multiple times, which results in a larger positive quantity. For instance:\n   $$\n   (-2) \times (-3) = 6\n   $$\n   This can be interpreted as adding -2 three times, which results in a positive value.\n\n3. **General Rule**: The general rule in mathematics states that:\n   - Negative × Negative = Positive\n   - Negative × Positive = Negative\n   - Positive × Positive = Positive\n\n4. **Examples**: \n   - For example, multiplying -5 by -1 gives:\n   $$\n   -5 \times -1 = 5\n   $$\n   - Another example is:\n   $$\n   (-3) \times (-4) = 12\n   $$\n\nIn summary, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number due to the cancellation of negative signs and the properties of multiplication. This principle is consistent across all negative integers.
