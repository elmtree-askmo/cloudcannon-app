    What is the domain of a function and how can it be expressed using set builder notation?
answer: >-
    The domain of a function refers to the complete set of possible values that the independent variable (input) can take. It is crucial to identify the domain because certain values may lead to undefined expressions, such as division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.\n\nFor example, consider the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \). The domain of this function is \( [0, \infty) \) because the square root is only defined for non-negative values of $ x $. Similarly, for the function \( g(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \), we need to determine when the denominator is zero to find the domain. The denominator $ x^2 - 1 = 0 $ when $ x = 1 $ or $ x = -1 $. Therefore, the domain of \( g(x) \) can be expressed in set builder notation as:\n\n$$\n\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \,|\, x \neq 1 \text{ and } x \neq -1 \}\n$$\n\nThis notation indicates that the domain includes all real numbers $ x $ except for $ 1 $ and $ -1 $.\n\nIn summary, the domain of a function can be expressed using set builder notation to clearly define the values that the independent variable can take, while excluding any values that would make the function undefined.
