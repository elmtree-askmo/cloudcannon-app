answer: >-
    Horizontal movement rules and vertical movement rules in translations differ primarily in the direction of the shifts they produce on the coordinate plane.\n\n### Horizontal Movement Rules\n1. **Definition**: Horizontal translations involve shifting the graph of a function left or right along the x-axis.\n2. **Rule**: If you have a function represented as \(y = f(x)\), a horizontal translation can be expressed as:\n   - \(y = f(x - h)\) for a shift to the right by $h$ units (where $h > 0$).\n   - \(y = f(x + h)\) for a shift to the left by $h$ units (where $h > 0$).\n3. **Effect on Coordinates**: The coordinates of points on the graph change as follows:\n   - From \((x, y)\) to \((x + h, y)\) for a right shift.\n   - From \((x, y)\) to \((x - h, y)\) for a left shift.\n4. **Example**: For the function \(y = f(x)\), if $h = 2$, then:\n   - Right shift: \(y = f(x - 2)\) moves the graph 2 units to the right.\n   - Left shift: \(y = f(x + 2)\) moves the graph 2 units to the left.\n\n### Vertical Movement Rules\n1. **Definition**: Vertical translations involve shifting the graph of a function up or down along the y-axis.\n2. **Rule**: For a function \(y = f(x)\), a vertical translation can be expressed as:\n   - \(y = f(x) + k\) for a shift upward by $k$ units (where $k > 0$).\n   - \(y = f(x) - k\) for a shift downward by $k$ units (where $k > 0$).\n3. **Effect on Coordinates**: The coordinates of points on the graph change as follows:\n   - From \((x, y)\) to \((x, y + k)\) for an upward shift.\n   - From \((x, y)\) to \((x, y - k)\) for a downward shift.\n4. **Example**: For the function \(y = f(x)\), if $k = 3$, then:\n   - Upward shift: \(y = f(x) + 3\) moves the graph 3 units up.\n   - Downward shift: \(y = f(x) - 3\) moves the graph 3 units down.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Direction of Movement**: Horizontal translations affect the x-values (left/right), while vertical translations affect the y-values (up/down).\n- **Mathematical Representation**: Horizontal shifts are represented by changes to the x-variable in the function, while vertical shifts are represented by changes to the function's output.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for accurately applying transformations to geometric figures and functions in the coordinate plane.
