    What is the formula for calculating the average rate of change of a function?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the average rate of change of a function between two points is:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nIn this formula:\n- \( f(a) \) is the value of the function at the first point $ a $.\n- \( f(b) \) is the value of the function at the second point $ b $.\n- $ a $ and $ b $ are the x-coordinates of the two points on the graph.\n\nThis formula represents the slope of the secant line that connects the two points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\) on the graph of the function. It can be applied to various types of functions, including linear, quadratic, exponential, square root, and cube root functions, as well as piecewise functions.\n\nFor example, if you want to find the average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) from $ x = -2 $ to $ x = 2 $, you would calculate it as follows:\n\n1. Determine \( f(-2) \) and \( f(2) \).\n2. Substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(2) - f(-2)}{2 - (-2)} = \frac{f(2) - f(-2)}{4}\n$$\n\nThis calculation will give you the average rate of change of the function over the interval from $ x = -2 $ to $ x = 2 $.
