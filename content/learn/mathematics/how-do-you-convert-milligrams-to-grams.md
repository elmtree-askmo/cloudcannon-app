    How do you convert milligrams to grams?
answer: >-
    To convert milligrams to grams, you need to understand the relationship between these two metric units. Milligrams (mg) are a smaller unit compared to grams (g), where:\n\n1 gram = 1,000 milligrams.\n\nWhen converting from a smaller unit (milligrams) to a larger unit (grams), you will move the decimal point to the left. Specifically, you will move it three places to the left because there are 1,000 milligrams in a gram.\n\n### Conversion Steps:\n1. **Identify the number of milligrams you want to convert.** For example, let's say you have 30,000 milligrams.\n2. **Move the decimal point three places to the left.** This is because you are converting from milligrams to grams:\n   - Starting with 30,000 mg, you move the decimal point three places left:\n     - $30,000 \rightarrow 30$ grams.\n\n### Example:\n- **Convert 30,000 milligrams to grams:**\n  - Move the decimal point three places to the left: \n  - $30,000 \text{ mg} = 30 \text{ g}$.\n\nThis method can be applied to any conversion from milligrams to grams by simply moving the decimal point three places to the left. Understanding this process is essential for accurate metric unit conversions.
