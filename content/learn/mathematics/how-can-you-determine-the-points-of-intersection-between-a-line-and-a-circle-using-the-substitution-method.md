    To determine the points of intersection between a line and a circle using the substitution method, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Equations**: Start with the equations of the line and the circle. The general form of a circle's equation is given by:\n   $$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$$\n   where \((h, k)\) is the center and $r$ is the radius. The equation of a line can be expressed in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ or in standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$.\n\n2. **Rearrange the Line's Equation**: If necessary, rearrange the line's equation to express $y$ in terms of $x$:\n   $$y = mx + b$$\n\n3. **Substitute into the Circle's Equation**: Substitute the expression for $y$ from the line's equation into the circle's equation. This will yield a quadratic equation in terms of $x$:\n   $$(x - h)^2 + (mx + b - k)^2 = r^2$$\n\n4. **Expand and Rearrange**: Expand the equation and rearrange it to set it to zero:\n   $$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$\n   where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are coefficients derived from the expansion.\n\n5. **Use the Discriminant**: To determine the nature of the intersection, calculate the discriminant $D$ of the quadratic equation:\n   $$D = B^2 - 4AC$$\n   - If $D > 0$, the line intersects the circle at two points.\n   - If $D = 0$, the line is tangent to the circle, intersecting at exactly one point.\n   - If $D < 0$, there is no intersection.\n\n6. **Solve for $x$**: If $D \geq 0$, use the quadratic formula to find the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points:\n   $$x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{D}}{2A}$$\n\n7. **Find Corresponding $y$-Coordinates**: Substitute the $x$-values back into the line's equation to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The points of intersection will be the pairs \((x, y)\) obtained from the above calculations.\n\n### Example\nConsider a line given by $y = 2x + 3$ and a circle with the equation \((x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 10\).\n\n1. Substitute $y$ into the circle's equation:\n   $$(x - 1)^2 + (2x + 3 - 2)^2 = 10$$\n   Simplifying gives:\n   $$(x - 1)^2 + (2x + 1)^2 = 10$$\n\n2. Expand and rearrange:\n   $$ (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (4x^2 + 4x + 1) = 10 $$\n   $$ 5x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0 $$\n\n3. Calculate the discriminant:\n   $$D = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (-8) = 4 + 160 = 164 > 0$$\n   Thus, there are two intersection points.\n\n4. Solve for $x$:\n   $$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{164}}{10}$$\n\n5. Find corresponding $y$ values using $y = 2x + 3$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the points of intersection between a line and a circle using the substitution method.
