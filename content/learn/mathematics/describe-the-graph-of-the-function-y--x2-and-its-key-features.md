    The graph of the function $ y = x^2 $ is a classic example of a quadratic function, and it exhibits several key features that are characteristic of parabolas.\n\n### Key Features of the Graph of $ y = x^2 $:\n\n1. **Shape**: The graph is a parabola that opens upwards. This is due to the positive coefficient of the $ x^2 $ term.\n\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex of the parabola is located at the origin, which is the point \( (0, 0) \). This is the minimum point of the graph since the parabola opens upwards.\n\n3. **Axis of Symmetry**: The graph is symmetric about the y-axis, which means that for every point \( (x, y) \) on the graph, there is a corresponding point \( (-x, y) \). The line $ x = 0 $ (the y-axis) serves as the axis of symmetry.\n\n4. **Domain**: The domain of the function is all real numbers, expressed as \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This means that any real number can be input into the function.\n\n5. **Range**: The range of the function is all non-negative real numbers, expressed as \( [0, \infty) \). This is because the output of $ y = x^2 $ is always zero or positive.\n\n6. **Intercepts**:\n   - **Y-intercept**: The y-intercept occurs at the point \( (0, 0) \), where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n   - **X-intercepts**: The x-intercept also occurs at the point \( (0, 0) \). This is the only x-intercept since the graph does not cross the x-axis at any other point.\n\n7. **Increasing and Decreasing Intervals**:\n   - The function is decreasing on the interval \( (-\infty, 0) \) as the values of $ y $ decrease as $ x $ approaches 0 from the left.\n   - The function is increasing on the interval \( (0, \infty) \) as the values of $ y $ increase as $ x $ moves away from 0 to the right.\n\n8. **Symmetry**: As mentioned, the graph is symmetric about the y-axis, which is a defining characteristic of even functions like $ y = x^2 $.\n\n### Graph Representation\nThe graph of $ y = x^2 $ can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\n   |\n  9|          *\n  8|         * *\n  7|        *   *\n  6|       *     *\n  5|      *       *\n  4|     *         *\n  3|    *           *\n  2|   *             *\n  1|  *               *\n  0| *-----------------*\n   | -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n```\n\nIn summary, the graph of $ y = x^2 $ is a parabola with its vertex at the origin, symmetric about the y-axis, with a domain of all real numbers and a range of non-negative real numbers. Understanding these features is essential for analyzing quadratic functions and their transformations.
