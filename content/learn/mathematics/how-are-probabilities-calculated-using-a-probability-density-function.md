answer: >-
    Probabilities for continuous random variables are calculated using a probability density function (PDF). A PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value within a specified range. Hereâ€™s how probabilities are calculated using a PDF:\n\n1. **Definition of PDF**: A probability density function \( f(x) \) for a continuous random variable \( X \) must satisfy two main conditions:\n   - \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \) in the support \( S \) of the random variable.\n   - The total area under the curve of the PDF over its support must equal 1, which is mathematically expressed as:\n   $$\n   \int_S f(x) \, dx = 1\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculating Probabilities**: To find the probability that the random variable \( X \) falls within a specific interval \([a, b]\), you need to integrate the PDF over that interval:\n   $$\n   P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n   $$\n   This integral gives the area under the curve of the PDF between the points \( a \) and \( b \), which corresponds to the probability that \( X \) takes a value in that range.\n\n3. **Example**: Suppose we have a PDF defined as:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   \frac{x}{2} & 0 \leq x < 4 \\ \n   0 & x \geq 4 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   To find the probability that \( X \) is between 1 and 2, we compute:\n   $$\n   P(1 < X < 2) = \int_1^2 f(x) \, dx = \int_1^2 \frac{x}{2} \, dx\n   $$\n   Evaluating this integral:\n   $$\n   = \left[ \frac{x^2}{4} \right]_1^2 = \left( \frac{2^2}{4} - \frac{1^2}{4} \right) = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{3}{4}\n   $$\n\n4. **Interpretation**: It is crucial to understand that while the PDF provides a density, the probability of the random variable taking on any exact value is zero. Instead, probabilities are derived from intervals, reflecting the continuous nature of the variable.\n\nIn summary, the PDF is a fundamental tool in probability theory for continuous random variables, allowing us to calculate probabilities over intervals through integration.
