    What is an example of a vertical translation?
answer: >-
    An example of a vertical translation can be illustrated using a simple function. Let's consider the base function \( f(x) = x^2 \), which is a parabola opening upwards. \n\nIf we apply a vertical translation of 3 units upwards, the new function can be expressed as:\n\n$$\ng(x) = f(x) + 3 = x^2 + 3\n$$\n\nIn this case, every point on the graph of \( f(x) \) is moved up by 3 units. For instance, the vertex of the original parabola at the point (0, 0) will now be at (0, 3) after the translation.\n\nConversely, if we wanted to translate the same function downwards by 2 units, the new function would be:\n\n$$\ng(x) = f(x) - 2 = x^2 - 2\n$$\n\nHere, every point on the graph of \( f(x) \) is moved down by 2 units, shifting the vertex from (0, 0) to (0, -2).\n\nIn summary, vertical translations involve shifting the graph of a function up or down by a constant value, maintaining the shape and orientation of the graph.
