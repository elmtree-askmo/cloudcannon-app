    What is a uniform distribution and how is it characterized?
answer: >-
    A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely to occur. It is characterized by two main types: discrete and continuous uniform distributions.\n\n1. **Discrete Uniform Distribution**: In this case, a finite number of outcomes exist, and each outcome has the same probability. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, each face (1 through 6) has a probability of $ \frac{1}{6} $. The probability mass function (PMF) for a discrete uniform distribution can be expressed as:\n   $$ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{n} $$\n   where $ n $ is the total number of outcomes.\n\n2. **Continuous Uniform Distribution**: This distribution is defined over an interval $[a, b]$, where every value within this interval is equally likely. The probability density function (PDF) for a continuous uniform distribution is given by:\n   $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} \n   \frac{1}{b-a} & \text{for } a \leq x \leq b \\\n   0 & \text{otherwise}\n   \end{cases} $$\n   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be calculated as:\n   $$ P(x_1 < X < x_2) = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{b - a} $$\n   where $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ are values within the interval $[a, b]$.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n- **Symmetry**: The uniform distribution is symmetric around its mean.\n- **Mean**: The mean (expected value) of a uniform distribution is calculated as:\n  $$ \text{Mean} = \frac{a + b}{2} $$\n- **Variance**: The variance of a uniform distribution is given by:\n  $$ \text{Variance} = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12} $$\n- **Graphical Representation**: The graph of a uniform distribution is a rectangle, indicating that the probability is constant across the interval.\n\nIn summary, the uniform distribution is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, characterized by equal likelihood of outcomes, defined by its parameters $ a $ (minimum) and $ b $ (maximum), and is applicable in various statistical analyses and modeling scenarios.
