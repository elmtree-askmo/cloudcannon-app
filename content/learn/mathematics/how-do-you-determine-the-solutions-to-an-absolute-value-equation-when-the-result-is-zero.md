    To determine the solutions to an absolute value equation when the result is zero, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line. Therefore, the absolute value can only be zero or a positive number. \n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**: If you have an equation of the form $|x| = 0$, you need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies this condition.\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**: The only number whose absolute value is zero is zero itself. Thus, the solution to the equation $|x| = 0$ is:\n   $$ \n   x = 0 \n   $$\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, when the absolute value equation results in zero, the solution is simply $x = 0$. There are no other solutions since absolute values cannot be negative.\n\nIn summary, for any absolute value equation of the form $|x| = 0$, the solution is always $x = 0$. If the equation were to equal a negative number, such as $|x| = -a$ (where $a > 0$), there would be no solutions, as absolute values cannot be negative.
