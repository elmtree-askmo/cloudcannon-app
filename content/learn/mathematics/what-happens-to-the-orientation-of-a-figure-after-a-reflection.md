    What happens to the orientation of a figure after a reflection?
answer: >-
    After a reflection, the orientation of a figure is laterally inverted. This means that while the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, the reflected image appears reversed or mirrored compared to the original figure. \n\nFor example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). This lateral inversion can be observed in various contexts, such as when reflecting geometric figures or functions. \n\nIn the case of functions, reflecting a function \(y = f(x)\) over the x-axis results in the transformation \(y = -f(x)\), which flips the graph upside down. Similarly, reflecting over the y-axis transforms it to \(y = f(-x)\). \n\nOverall, the key points regarding the orientation after a reflection are:\n\n1. **Lateral Inversion**: The reflected image faces the opposite direction compared to the original figure.\n2. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape.\n3. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is an isometric transformation, preserving distances between points.\n\nThus, the orientation change is a fundamental characteristic of reflections in geometry.
