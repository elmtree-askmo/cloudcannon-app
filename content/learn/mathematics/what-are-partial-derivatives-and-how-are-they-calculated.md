answer: >-
    Partial derivatives are a fundamental concept in multivariable calculus, used to analyze functions that depend on two or more variables. A partial derivative measures how a function changes as one of its input variables changes, while keeping the other variables constant.\n\n### Definition\nFor a function \( z = f(x, y) \), the partial derivative with respect to $ x $ is denoted as $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} $. This represents the rate of change of the function $ f $ as $ x $ varies, while $ y $ is held constant. Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to $ y $ is denoted as $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} $.\n\n### Calculation\nTo calculate a partial derivative, follow these steps:\n1. **Choose the variable**: Decide which variable you want to differentiate with respect to (e.g., $ x $ or $ y $).\n2. **Treat other variables as constants**: Consider all other variables as constants during differentiation.\n3. **Differentiate**: Apply the standard rules of differentiation to the function with respect to the chosen variable.\n\nFor example, if you have a function \( f(x, y) = x^2y + 3xy^2 \):\n- To find $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} $:\n  - Treat $ y $ as a constant.\n  - Differentiate: \n  $$\n  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy + 3y^2\n  $$\n  \n- To find $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} $:\n  - Treat $ x $ as a constant.\n  - Differentiate:\n  $$\n  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2 + 6xy\n  $$\n\n### Notation\nThe symbol $ \partial $ is used to denote partial derivatives, distinguishing them from ordinary derivatives, which use $ d $. For instance, the partial derivative of $ f $ with respect to $ x $ is written as $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} $.\n\n### Applications\nPartial derivatives are crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics, as they help in understanding how changes in one variable affect a function while other variables remain fixed. They are also used in optimization problems, where one seeks to find maximum or minimum values of functions of several variables.\n\nIn summary, partial derivatives provide a way to analyze the behavior of multivariable functions by focusing on the effect of changing one variable at a time, which is essential for understanding complex systems in mathematics and applied sciences.
