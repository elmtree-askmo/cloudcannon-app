    What is orientation reversal in the context of reflections?
answer: >-
    In the context of reflections, orientation reversal refers to the change in the arrangement or order of the vertices of a geometric figure when it is reflected across a line (the line of reflection). When a figure is reflected, it is essentially flipped over the line of reflection, which results in the vertices being rearranged in the opposite order. \n\nFor example, if a triangle has vertices labeled A, B, and C in a clockwise order, after reflection over a line, the reflected triangle might have its vertices labeled in a counterclockwise order, such as C', B', and A'. This change in the order of the vertices signifies that the orientation of the figure has been reversed.\n\nIt is important to note that while the orientation of the figure changes, the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged. This characteristic of reflection is what classifies it as a type of transformation known as an isometry, specifically an "opposite isometry," because it preserves distances but alters the orientation.\n\nIn summary, orientation reversal in reflections is the phenomenon where the order of vertices is flipped, leading to a change in the perceived orientation of the figure while maintaining its congruence in size and shape.
