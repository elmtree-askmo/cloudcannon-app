    Define a propositional formula and describe its structure.
answer: >-
    A propositional formula is a structured expression that combines propositional variables and logical operators to represent a logical statement. The structure of a propositional formula can be categorized into two main types: atomic propositions and compound propositions.\n\n1. **Atomic Propositions**: These are the simplest forms of propositional formulas, consisting of a single propositional variable that can either be true (T) or false (F). For example, the variable $ p $ is an atomic proposition.\n\n2. **Compound Propositions**: These are formed by combining two or more atomic propositions using logical operators. The logical operators include:\n   - **Negation (¬)**: This operator inverts the truth value of a proposition. For example, if $ p $ is true, then $ ¬p $ is false.\n   - **Conjunction (∧)**: This operator represents the logical "and." The compound proposition $ p ∧ q $ is true only if both $ p $ and $ q $ are true.\n   - **Disjunction (∨)**: This operator represents the logical "or." The compound proposition $ p ∨ q $ is true if at least one of $ p $ or $ q $ is true.\n   - **Exclusive-or (⊕)**: This operator is true if exactly one of the propositions is true.\n   - **Implication (→)**: The proposition $ p → q $ is true unless $ p $ is true and $ q $ is false.\n   - **Bi-implication (↔)**: The proposition $ p ↔ q $ is true if both $ p $ and $ q $ have the same truth value.\n\nAn example of a compound propositional formula is \( p ∧ (q ∨ r) \), which combines the variables $ p $, $ q $, and $ r $ using conjunction and disjunction.\n\nThe truth value of a propositional formula can be determined by evaluating the truth values of its constituent propositions according to the rules of the logical operators used. This evaluation process is often represented in a truth table, which systematically lists all possible truth values for the variables involved and the resulting truth value of the formula.\n\nIn summary, a propositional formula is a logical statement constructed from propositional variables and logical operators, and its structure can be simple or complex depending on the combination of these elements.
