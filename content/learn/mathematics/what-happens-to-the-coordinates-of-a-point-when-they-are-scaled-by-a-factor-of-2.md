    What happens to the coordinates of a point when they are scaled by a factor of 2?
answer: >-
    When a point's coordinates are scaled by a factor of 2, each coordinate of the point is multiplied by 2. This transformation affects both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point.\n\nFor example, if we have a point \( P(x, y) \), after scaling by a factor of 2, the new coordinates $ P' $ will be:\n\n$$\nP'(x', y') = (2x, 2y)\n$$\n\nThis means that if the original point $ P $ has coordinates \( (x, y) \), the new coordinates after scaling will be \( (2x, 2y) \).\n\n### Example:\n- If the original point is \( P(3, 4) \):\n  - After scaling by a factor of 2, the new coordinates will be:\n  $$\n  P'(3 \cdot 2, 4 \cdot 2) = P'(6, 8)\n  $$\n\n### Effects of Scaling:\n1. **Distance from Origin**: The distance of the point from the origin will also double.\n2. **Graphical Representation**: If you visualize this on a coordinate plane, the entire graph will stretch away from the origin, making it appear larger.\n3. **Symmetry**: The relative positions of points will remain the same, but they will be farther from the origin.\n\nIn summary, scaling a point by a factor of 2 results in both coordinates being multiplied by 2, effectively moving the point further away from the origin while maintaining its direction.
