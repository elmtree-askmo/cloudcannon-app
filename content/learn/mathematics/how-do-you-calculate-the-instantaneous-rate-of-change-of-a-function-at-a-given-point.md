    How do you calculate the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a given point?
answer: >-
    To calculate the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a given point, you need to find the derivative of the function at that specific point. The derivative provides a measure of how the function's output value changes as its input value changes, effectively giving you the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.\n\nThe mathematical definition of the derivative of a function $ f $ at a point $ x $ is given by:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n$$\n\nThis formula represents the limit of the average rate of change of the function as the interval $ h $ approaches zero. Hereâ€™s how you can calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Choose the function**: Identify the function \( f(x) \) for which you want to find the instantaneous rate of change.\n\n2. **Select the point**: Determine the specific point $ x $ at which you want to calculate the instantaneous rate of change.\n\n3. **Apply the derivative formula**: Substitute the function and the point into the derivative formula. This involves calculating \( f(x+h) \) and \( f(x) \).\n\n4. **Evaluate the limit**: Simplify the expression and compute the limit as $ h $ approaches zero.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say we have the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and we want to find the instantaneous rate of change at the point $ x = 3 $.\n\n1. **Function**: \( f(x) = x^2 \)\n2. **Point**: $ x = 3 $\n3. **Derivative calculation**:\n   - Calculate \( f(3+h) = (3+h)^2 = 9 + 6h + h^2 \)\n   - Calculate \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)\n   - Substitute into the derivative formula:\n   $$\n   f'(3) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(9 + 6h + h^2) - 9}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} (6 + h) = 6\n   $$\n\nThus, the instantaneous rate of change of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) at the point $ x = 3 $ is $ 6 $.\n\nThis process can be applied to any differentiable function to find the instantaneous rate of change at any point.
