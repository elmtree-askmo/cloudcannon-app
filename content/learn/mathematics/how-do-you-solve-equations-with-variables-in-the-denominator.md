answer: >-
    To solve equations with variables in the denominator, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator**: First, determine the variable expressions in the denominator. For example, in the equation $ \frac{7 - 10/x}{1} = 2 + \frac{15}{x} $, the variable $ x $ is in the denominator.\n\n2. **Clear the Denominator**: Multiply both sides of the equation by the variable expression in the denominator to eliminate the fractions. For instance, multiplying both sides by $ x $ gives:\n   $$\n   x(7 - 10/x) = x(2 + 15/x)\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   7x - 10 = 2x + 15\n   $$\n\n3. **Rearrange the Equation**: Move all terms involving the variable to one side and constant terms to the other side. Continuing from the previous step:\n   $$\n   7x - 2x = 15 + 10\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   5x = 25\n   $$\n\n4. **Solve for the Variable**: Isolate the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient of the variable:\n   $$\n   x = \frac{25}{5} = 5\n   $$\n\n5. **Check for Extraneous Solutions**: Substitute the solution back into the original equation to ensure it does not make any denominator equal to zero. In this case, $ x = 5 $ does not lead to any undefined expressions.\n\n6. **Identify Undefined Values**: Always check for values that would make the denominator zero. For example, if the denominator was $ x - 3 $, then $ x = 3 $ would be excluded from the solution set as it makes the expression undefined.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively solve equations with variables in the denominator while ensuring that you avoid undefined expressions.
