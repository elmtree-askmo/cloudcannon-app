    What are the possible outcomes when a line intersects a circle?
answer: >-
    When a line intersects a circle, there are three possible outcomes based on the nature of the intersection, which can be determined by analyzing the resulting quadratic equation formed from substituting the line's equation into the circle's equation. The outcomes are as follows:\n\n1. **Two Points of Intersection**: If the discriminant of the quadratic equation, given by $b^2 - 4ac$, is greater than zero ($b^2 - 4ac > 0$), the line intersects the circle at two distinct points. This means that the line passes through the circle, entering and exiting at two different locations.\n\n2. **Tangent to the Circle**: If the discriminant equals zero ($b^2 - 4ac = 0$), the line is tangent to the circle. In this case, the line touches the circle at exactly one point, meaning it just grazes the circle without crossing it. At this point of tangency, the line is perpendicular to the radius of the circle that meets the line.\n\n3. **No Intersection**: If the discriminant is less than zero ($b^2 - 4ac < 0$), the line does not intersect the circle at all. This indicates that the line is completely outside the circle and does not touch or cross it.\n\nTo summarize, the possible outcomes when a line intersects a circle are:\n- Two intersection points (discriminant > 0)\n- One tangential point (discriminant = 0)\n- No intersection (discriminant < 0) \n\nThese outcomes are crucial for understanding the geometric relationship between lines and circles in coordinate geometry.
