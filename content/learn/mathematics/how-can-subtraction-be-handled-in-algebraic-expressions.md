    Subtraction in algebraic expressions can be effectively handled using a systematic approach. Here are the steps and methods to perform subtraction of algebraic expressions:\n\n### Steps to Handle Subtraction\n\n1. **Arrange the Terms**: First, arrange the terms of the given expressions in the same order. This helps in aligning like terms for easier subtraction.\n\n2. **Write in Rows**: Write the expressions in two rows, ensuring that like terms are positioned one below the other. The expression to be subtracted should be in the second row.\n\n3. **Change the Signs**: Change the sign of each term in the lower row from positive to negative and from negative to positive. This step is crucial as it transforms the subtraction into an addition problem.\n\n### Methods for Subtraction\n\nThere are two primary methods for subtracting algebraic expressions:\n\n1. **Horizontal Method**: \n   - Write the expressions in a single line, separating them with a minus sign.\n   - Combine like terms by subtracting their coefficients directly.\n\n   **Example**: To subtract \( (3x + 2) - (x + 5) \):\n   - Combine like terms: \( (3x - x) + (2 - 5) = 2x - 3 \).\n\n2. **Column Method**: \n   - This method involves writing the expressions in a vertical format, similar to traditional subtraction.\n   - Align like terms and perform the subtraction as you would with numbers.\n\n   **Example**: For \( 2x + 5y + 7 - (3x - 2y - 1) \):\n   - Write it as:\n     ```\n     2x + 5y + 7\n    - (3x - 2y - 1)\n     ```\n   - Change the signs in the second row:\n     ```\n     2x + 5y + 7\n     - 3x + 2y + 1\n     ```\n   - Now combine like terms: \n     - \( (2x - 3x) + (5y + 2y) + (7 + 1) = -x + 7y + 8 \).\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Combining Like Terms**: When subtracting, ensure that you only combine like terms (terms with the same variable and exponent). This is similar to adding or subtracting numbers.\n  \n- **Interpreting Subtraction Signs**: When you encounter a subtraction sign, treat the following term as a negative term. For instance, in the expression $ 5 - x $, the $ x $ is treated as $ -x $.\n\nBy following these methods and steps, subtraction of algebraic expressions can be performed accurately and efficiently, allowing for simplification and further manipulation of algebraic equations.
