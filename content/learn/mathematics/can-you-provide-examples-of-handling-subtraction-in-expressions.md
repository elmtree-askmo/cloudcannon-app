    Handling subtraction in algebraic expressions involves a systematic approach to ensure accuracy. Here are some examples that illustrate how to perform subtraction with algebraic expressions:\n\n### Example 1\n**Subtract $3x^2 + 2x$ from $4x^2 + 7y$**\n\n1. Write the expression to be subtracted in parentheses:\n   $$\n   4x^2 + 7y - (3x^2 + 2x)\n   $$\n2. Change the sign of each term in the expression being subtracted:\n   $$\n   4x^2 + 7y - 3x^2 - 2x\n   $$\n3. Combine like terms:\n   $$\n   (4x^2 - 3x^2) + (7y) - (2x) = 1x^2 + 7y - 2x\n   $$\n   Thus, the simplified expression is:\n   $$\n   x^2 + 7y - 2x\n   $$\n\n### Example 2\n**Subtract \((8m + 3 - 2n)\) from \((7m - 4n + 3)\)**\n\n1. Set up the expression:\n   $$\n   (7m - 4n + 3) - (8m + 3 - 2n)\n   $$\n2. Change the signs:\n   $$\n   7m - 4n + 3 - 8m - 3 + 2n\n   $$\n3. Combine like terms:\n   $$\n   (7m - 8m) + (-4n + 2n) + (3 - 3) = -1m - 2n + 0\n   $$\n   Thus, the simplified expression is:\n   $$\n   -m - 2n\n   $$\n\n### Example 3\n**Subtract \(5(3x + 4)\) from \(8 - 5(3x + 4)\)**\n\n1. First, distribute $5$ in the second expression:\n   $$\n   8 - (15x + 20)\n   $$\n2. Change the signs:\n   $$\n   8 - 15x - 20\n   $$\n3. Combine like terms:\n   $$\n   (8 - 20) - 15x = -12 - 15x\n   $$\n   Thus, the simplified expression is:\n   $$\n   -15x - 12\n   $$\n\n### Key Points\n- When subtracting, always change the signs of the terms in the expression being subtracted.\n- Combine like terms carefully, ensuring that you keep track of the coefficients and variables.\n- The order of operations is crucial; handle any distribution before combining like terms.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the process of handling subtraction in algebraic expressions effectively.
