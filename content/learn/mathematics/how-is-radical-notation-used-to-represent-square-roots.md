    How is radical notation used to represent square roots?
answer: >-
    Radical notation is a mathematical way to express roots of numbers using the radical symbol (√). This notation is particularly important when dealing with square roots. Here’s a detailed explanation of how radical notation is used to represent square roots:\n\n1. **Square Root Definition**: A square root of a number $ x $ is a value $ y $ such that when $ y $ is multiplied by itself (i.e., $ y \times y $), it equals $ x $. For example, both 3 and -3 are square roots of 9 because $ 3^2 = 9 $ and \( (-3)^2 = 9 \).\n\n2. **Principal Square Root**: The principal square root is the non-negative square root of a number, which is typically represented by the radical sign. For instance, the principal square root of 9 is denoted as $ \sqrt{9} $, which equals 3. This notation specifically refers to the positive root.\n\n3. **Radical Sign**: The radical sign $ \sqrt{} $ is used to denote the square root of a number. When you see a number under this sign, it indicates the principal square root. For example, $ \sqrt{16} = 4 $.\n\n4. **Negative Square Root**: While the radical notation indicates the principal square root, it is important to note that every positive number has a corresponding negative square root. This can be expressed using the plus-minus sign (±). For example, to denote both the positive and negative square roots of 9, one would write $ \pm \sqrt{9} $, which equals $ \pm 3 $.\n\n5. **Usage in Algebra**: Radical notation is commonly used in algebra to simplify expressions involving roots. It allows for clear communication of mathematical ideas and operations involving square roots.\n\nIn summary, radical notation is a concise and standardized way to represent square roots, emphasizing the distinction between the principal square root and the concept of square roots in general.
