    What is a loaded die and how does it differ from a fair die?
answer: >-
    A loaded die, also known as a weighted, cheat, or crooked die, is a die that has been tampered with to alter the probabilities of its outcomes. Unlike a fair die, which has an equal probability of landing on any of its six faces (specifically, a probability of $1/6$ for each face), a loaded die is designed so that certain numbers appear more frequently than others.\n\nThere are various methods to create a loaded die, including:\n\n1. **Weight Distribution**: Adding weight off-center to make one side more likely to land face down. This can be achieved by placing weights inside the die or altering its shape.\n2. **Physical Alterations**: Modifying the die's shape, such as rounding corners or edges, can affect how it rolls and which face ends up on top.\n3. **Biasing Outcomes**: For example, a loaded die might be biased so that the number 3 appears twice as often as the other numbers, resulting in a probability distribution like this: \n   - $P(1) = 1/7$\n   - $P(2) = 1/7$\n   - $P(3) = 2/7$\n   - $P(4) = 1/7$\n   - $P(5) = 1/7$\n   - $P(6) = 1/7$\n\nIn contrast, a fair die maintains equal probabilities for all outcomes, ensuring that each face has the same chance of appearing when rolled. The manipulation of a loaded die's physical properties leads to a skewed probability distribution, making it a tool often used in pranks or magic tricks, as it can produce predictable results that deviate from the randomness expected from a fair die. \n\nIn summary, the key difference between a loaded die and a fair die lies in the probability distribution of their outcomes, with the loaded die favoring certain numbers over others, while the fair die treats all outcomes equally.
