    Describe the effect of reflecting a point across both the x-axis and y-axis.
answer: >-
    When reflecting a point across both the x-axis and the y-axis, the transformations can be understood step by step.\n\n1. **Reflection Across the x-axis**: \n   - For a point with coordinates \((x, y)\), reflecting it across the x-axis changes the y-coordinate to its negative. Thus, the new coordinates after this reflection become \((x, -y)\).\n\n2. **Reflection Across the y-axis**: \n   - Next, reflecting the point \((x, -y)\) across the y-axis changes the x-coordinate to its negative. Therefore, the coordinates after this reflection become \((-x, -y)\).\n\n### Summary of the Transformation:\n- Starting with a point \((x, y)\):\n  - After reflecting across the x-axis: \((x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)\)\n  - After reflecting across the y-axis: \((x, -y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\)\n\nThus, the overall effect of reflecting a point across both the x-axis and y-axis is to transform the original point \((x, y)\) into \((-x, -y)\). This means that the point is effectively moved to the opposite quadrant in the Cartesian plane, maintaining the same distance from the origin but in the opposite direction. \n\n### Example:\nIf we start with the point \(P(3, 4)\):\n- Reflecting across the x-axis gives \(P'(3, -4)\).\n- Reflecting $P'$ across the y-axis gives \(P''(-3, -4)\).\n\nTherefore, the final coordinates after reflecting the point \(P(3, 4)\) across both axes are \((-3, -4)\).
