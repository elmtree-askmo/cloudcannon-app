    How is a reflection defined in geometric terms?
answer: >-
    In geometric terms, a reflection is defined as a type of transformation that involves flipping a shape or object across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This transformation results in a mirror image of the original shape, which retains the same size and shape but appears reversed or mirrored.\n\n### Key Concepts of Reflection:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: This is the line across which the reflection occurs, acting like a mirror. Common lines of reflection include:\n   - The x-axis\n   - The y-axis\n   - The line $y = x$\n\n2. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distances between points are preserved. Consequently, the original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n\n3. **Properties of Reflections**:\n   - The image and the pre-image (the original shape) are of the same size and shape.\n   - The orientation of the figure is reversed in the reflected image.\n   - Each point on the original shape is equidistant from the line of reflection to its corresponding point in the reflected image.\n\nReflections are widely utilized in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering, to model symmetrical properties and behaviors. They provide a fundamental way to visualize and manipulate shapes and graphs through flipping across designated lines.
