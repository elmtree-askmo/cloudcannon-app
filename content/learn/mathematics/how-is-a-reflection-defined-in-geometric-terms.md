    How is a reflection defined in geometric terms?
answer: >-
    In geometric terms, a reflection is defined as a type of transformation that flips a shape or object across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. This transformation results in a mirror image of the original shape, which retains the same size and shape but appears reversed or mirrored.\n\n### Key Concepts of Reflection:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: The line across which the reflection occurs acts like a mirror. Common lines of reflection include:\n   - The x-axis\n   - The y-axis\n   - The line $y = x$\n\n2. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n\n3. **Properties of Reflections**:\n   - The image and the pre-image (the original shape) are of the same size and shape.\n   - The orientation of the figure is reversed; for example, if the original shape is oriented in a certain direction, the reflected image will be oriented in the opposite direction.\n\n4. **Applications**: Reflections are widely used in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering, to model symmetrical properties and behaviors.\n\nIn summary, reflection is a fundamental concept in geometry and mathematical transformations, providing a way to visualize and manipulate shapes and graphs through flipping across designated lines.
