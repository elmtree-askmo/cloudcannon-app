    Grouped frequencies are a statistical method used to organize data into intervals or classes, simplifying analysis of large datasets. This process involves determining the range, deciding on the number of classes, calculating class widths, tallying frequencies, and constructing a grouped frequency table.

    What are grouped frequencies, and how are they calculated?
answer: >-
    Grouped frequencies refer to the organization of data into intervals or classes, allowing for a more manageable analysis of large datasets. This method is particularly useful in statistics when dealing with continuous data, as it simplifies the presentation and interpretation of the data distribution.\n\n### Calculation of Grouped Frequencies\n\nTo calculate grouped frequencies, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Range**: \n   Calculate the range of the data by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. For example, if the smallest value is 1 and the largest is 18, the range is:\n   $$ \n   \text{Range} = \text{Maximum} - \text{Minimum} = 18 - 1 = 17 \n   $$\n\n2. **Decide on the Number of Classes**: \n   Choose the number of classes (intervals) you want to create. Typically, this can range from 5 to 20 classes, depending on the size of the dataset and the level of detail required.\n\n3. **Calculate Class Width**: \n   The class width can be calculated by dividing the range by the number of classes and rounding up to a convenient number. For instance, if you decide on 5 classes:\n   $$\n   \text{Class Width} = \frac{\text{Range}}{\text{Number of Classes}} = \frac{17}{5} \approx 3.4 \quad \text{(round up to 4)}\n   $$\n\n4. **Create Class Intervals**: \n   Start from a value less than or equal to the minimum value and create intervals using the calculated class width. For example, if starting from 1 and using a width of 4, the intervals could be:\n   - 1 - 4\n   - 5 - 8\n   - 9 - 12\n   - 13 - 16\n   - 17 - 20\n\n5. **Tally Frequencies**: \n   Count how many data points fall into each class interval. This is done by going through the dataset and marking a tally for each value that fits into a specific interval.\n\n6. **Construct the Grouped Frequency Table**: \n   Finally, create a table that lists each class interval alongside its corresponding frequency. For example:\n\n   | Class Interval | Frequency |\n   |----------------|-----------|\n   | 1 - 4          | 5         |\n   | 5 - 8          | 7         |\n   | 9 - 12         | 6         |\n   | 13 - 16        | 4         |\n   | 17 - 20        | 3         |\n\nThis grouped frequency table provides a clear summary of the data distribution, making it easier to analyze and interpret the results. Grouped frequencies are often visualized using histograms, where the height of each bar represents the frequency of data points within each interval.
