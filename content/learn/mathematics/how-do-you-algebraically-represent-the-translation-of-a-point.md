    How do you algebraically represent the translation of a point?
answer: >-
    To algebraically represent the translation of a point in the coordinate plane, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Original Point**: Let the original point be represented as \( P(x, y) \), where $ x $ and $ y $ are the coordinates of the point.\n\n2. **Define the Translation Vector**: A translation can be defined by a vector \( \vec{v} = (a, b) \), where $ a $ is the horizontal shift and $ b $ is the vertical shift.\n\n3. **Apply the Translation**: The new position of the point after translation can be calculated by adding the translation vector to the original point's coordinates. The algebraic representation of the translated point $ P' $ is given by:\n\n   $$\n   P'(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)\n   $$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ x' $ is the new x-coordinate after translation.\n- $ y' $ is the new y-coordinate after translation.\n\nFor example, if you have a point \( P(2, 3) \) and you want to translate it by the vector \( \vec{v} = (4, -2) \), the new coordinates would be:\n\n$$\nP'(x', y') = (2 + 4, 3 - 2) = (6, 1)\n$$\n\nThus, the point \( P(2, 3) \) translates to \( P'(6, 1) \).\n\nThis method can be applied to any point in the coordinate plane to find its new position after a translation.
