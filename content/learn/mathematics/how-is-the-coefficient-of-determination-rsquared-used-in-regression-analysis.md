    How is the coefficient of determination (R-squared) used in regression analysis?
answer: >-
    The coefficient of determination, commonly referred to as R-squared (R²), is a key statistical measure used in regression analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model. It quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s). Here are some important aspects of R-squared:\n\n1. **Definition and Interpretation**: R-squared is defined as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance in the dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   R^2 = \frac{\text{Explained Variation}}{\text{Total Variation}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}\n   $$\n   where \(SS_{\text{res}}\) is the sum of squares of residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values), and \(SS_{\text{tot}}\) is the total sum of squares (the variance of the dependent variable). The value of R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variance in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that it perfectly explains the variance.\n\n2. **Goodness of Fit**: A higher R-squared value suggests a better fit of the model to the data, meaning that a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variable(s). For example, an R-squared value of 0.956 indicates that 95.6% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the model.\n\n3. **Limitations**: While R-squared is a useful measure, it has limitations. It does not account for the number of predictors in the model, which can lead to overfitting—where a model appears to fit the data well due to the inclusion of too many variables. To address this, the adjusted R-squared is often used, which adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors and the sample size.\n\n4. **Comparative Measure**: R-squared can be used to compare the explanatory power of different models. However, it is important to note that a higher R-squared does not always mean a better model, especially if the model is overly complex.\n\n5. **Application**: R-squared is widely used across various fields, including finance, research, and data science, to evaluate the predictive accuracy and reliability of regression models.\n\nIn summary, R-squared is a fundamental statistic in regression analysis that helps researchers and analysts understand how well their models explain the variability of the dependent variable. However, it should be interpreted with caution, considering its limitations and the context of the analysis.
