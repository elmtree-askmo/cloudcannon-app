    How do you determine the input and output values of a function?
answer: >-
    To determine the input and output values of a function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Start with the function you are working with. For example, consider the function \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \).\n\n2. **Select Input Values**: Choose specific values for the input variable (often denoted as $ x $). These values are part of the function's domain, which is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined.\n\n3. **Calculate Output Values**: Substitute the chosen input values into the function to find the corresponding output values. The output values are the results produced by the function, often denoted as \( f(x) \).\n\n   For example, if you select an input value of $ x = 4 $:\n   $$\n   f(4) = 2(4) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n   $$\n   Thus, the output value is 9.\n\n4. **Repeat for Other Inputs**: You can repeat this process for other input values to see how the output changes. For instance:\n   - For $ x = 0 $:\n     $$\n     f(0) = 2(0) + 1 = 1\n     $$\n   - For $ x = -3 $:\n     $$\n     f(-3) = 2(-3) + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5\n     $$\n\n5. **Graphing the Function**: To visualize the relationship between input and output values, you can graph the function. The x-axis typically represents the input values, while the y-axis represents the output values. For the function \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \), you would plot points such as (4, 9), (0, 1), and (-3, -5) on a coordinate plane.\n\n6. **Understanding Domain and Range**: The domain consists of all the input values you can use, while the range consists of all the output values that the function can produce. For linear functions like \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \), the domain and range are typically all real numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the input and output values of a function, understand its behavior, and visualize it through graphing.
