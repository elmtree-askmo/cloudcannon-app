    How do reflections ensure that figures remain congruent?
answer: >-
    Reflections in geometry are a type of transformation that ensure figures remain congruent by flipping them across a specific line known as the line of reflection. This transformation has several key properties that contribute to the congruence of the original figure and its reflected image.\n\n### Key Properties of Reflections:\n\n1. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflections are classified as isometric transformations. This means that the distances between points in the original figure and the reflected image are preserved. As a result, the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, ensuring that the original figure and its reflection are congruent.\n\n2. **Line of Reflection**: The line of reflection acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$. Each point on the original figure is reflected across this line to create the corresponding point on the reflected image. The distance from each point to the line of reflection is the same for both the original and the reflected points, which reinforces the congruence.\n\n3. **Orientation**: While reflections maintain the size and shape of the figure, they do invert the orientation. This means that if the original figure is oriented in a certain way, the reflected image will face the opposite direction. For example, if a figure is oriented clockwise, its reflection will be oriented counterclockwise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, reflections ensure that figures remain congruent by preserving distances and dimensions through isometric transformation. The original figure and its reflection are mirror images of each other, maintaining the same size and shape, while their orientations are inverted. This property of reflections is fundamental in various applications, including symmetry in art, design, and mathematical modeling.
