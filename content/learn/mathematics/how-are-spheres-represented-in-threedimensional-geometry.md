    How are spheres represented in three-dimensional geometry?
answer: >-
    In three-dimensional geometry, a sphere is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant from a given point known as the center. The distance from the center to any point on the surface of the sphere is referred to as the radius. \n\nThe mathematical representation of a sphere in three-dimensional space is given by the equation:\n\n$$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = r^2$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- \((x, y, z)\) are the coordinates of any point on the surface of the sphere.\n- \((h, k, l)\) are the coordinates of the center of the sphere.\n- $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\nThis equation describes all the points \((x, y, z)\) that are at a distance $r$ from the center \((h, k, l)\).\n\nAdditionally, the surface area $S$ of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nS = 4\pi r^2\n$$\n\nAnd the volume $V$ of a sphere is given by:\n\n$$\nV = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\n$$\n\nSpheres are significant in various fields, including physics and engineering, where they are used to model objects such as tanks, domes, and wheels. Their geometric properties allow for efficient load distribution and aesthetic design in structural applications.
