    What is the definition and properties of absolute value?
answer: >-
    The absolute value of a number is defined as its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It is denoted as |x|. For example, |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3. This means that the absolute value function always yields a non-negative result, as it measures the magnitude of a number without regard to its sign.\n\n### Properties of Absolute Value:\n\n1. **Non-negativity**: For any real number $ x $, the absolute value is always non-negative:\n   $$ |x| \geq 0 $$\n\n2. **Identity**: The absolute value of a number is equal to the number itself if it is non-negative:\n   $$ |x| = x \quad \text{if } x \geq 0 $$\n\n3. **Negation**: The absolute value of a negative number is the opposite of that number:\n   $$ |x| = -x \quad \text{if } x < 0 $$\n\n4. **Symmetry**: The absolute value function is symmetric about the y-axis, meaning:\n   $$ |x| = |-x| $$\n\n5. **Triangle Inequality**: For any two real numbers $ a $ and $ b $:\n   $$ |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| $$\n\n6. **Multiplicative Property**: The absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values:\n   $$ |ab| = |a| |b| $$\n\n7. **Additive Property**: The absolute value of a difference is less than or equal to the difference of the absolute values:\n   $$ ||a| - |b|| \leq |a - b| $$\n\n### Graph of the Absolute Value Function:\nThe graph of the absolute value function \( f(x) = |x| \) is a V-shaped graph that opens upwards. It intersects the y-axis at the origin (0,0) and has a vertex at this point. The function is piecewise defined as follows:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \n\begin{cases} \nx & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\\n-x & \text{if } x < 0 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### Applications:\nAbsolute value functions are commonly used in real-world applications where only the magnitude of a quantity matters, such as measuring distances, deviations, and in various fields of science and engineering.\n\nIn summary, the absolute value is a fundamental concept in mathematics that provides a way to quantify distance and magnitude, and it has several important properties that are useful in various mathematical contexts.
