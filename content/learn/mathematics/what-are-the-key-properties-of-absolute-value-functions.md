    What are the key properties of absolute value functions?
answer: >-
    The key properties of absolute value functions are as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**: An absolute value function is defined as \( f(x) = |x| \) for a real number \( x \). More generally, it can be expressed in the form \( f(x) = a |x - h| + k \), where \( a \), \( h \), and \( k \) are constants. Here, \( a \) affects the vertical stretch or compression, \( h \) represents a horizontal shift, and \( k \) indicates a vertical shift.\n\n2. **Non-negativity**: The output of an absolute value function is always non-negative, meaning \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \). This is because the absolute value measures the distance from zero, which cannot be negative.\n\n3. **Piecewise Definition**: The absolute value function can be expressed as a piecewise function:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\\n   -x & \text{if } x < 0 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   This reflects the fact that the function behaves differently depending on whether \( x \) is positive or negative.\n\n4. **Graphical Representation**: The graph of an absolute value function resembles a "V" shape, with a vertex at the point \( (h, k) \). The arms of the "V" extend infinitely in both directions, and the graph is symmetric with respect to the vertical line \( x = h \).\n\n5. **Reflection and Symmetry**: Absolute value functions exhibit reflectional symmetry about the vertical line \( x = h \). This means that for every point \( (x, f(x)) \) on the graph, there is a corresponding point \( (-x + 2h, f(x)) \).\n\n6. **Vertex**: The vertex of the absolute value function \( f(x) = a |x - h| + k \) is located at the point \( (h, k) \). This point represents the minimum value of the function when \( a > 0 \) and the maximum value when \( a < 0 \).\n\n7. **Continuity**: Absolute value functions are continuous everywhere on their domain, which is all real numbers. There are no breaks, jumps, or holes in the graph.\n\n8. **Applications**: Absolute value functions are commonly used to measure distances, solve inequalities, and model real-world situations where only non-negative values are meaningful, such as in physics and economics.\n\nThese properties make absolute value functions a fundamental concept in algebra and calculus, often serving as a building block for more complex functions and analyses.
