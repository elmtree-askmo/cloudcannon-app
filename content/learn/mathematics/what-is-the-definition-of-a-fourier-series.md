    What is the definition of a Fourier Series?
answer: >-
    A Fourier series is a mathematical representation of a periodic function as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions, or equivalently, as a sum of complex exponentials. This representation allows us to express a periodic function \( f(x) \) in terms of its frequency components.\n\nThe general formula for the Fourier series of a function \( f(x) \) is given by:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \frac{1}{2} a_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n} \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_{n} \sin(nx)\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients $ a_{0} $, $ a_{n} $, and $ b_{n} $ are calculated as follows:\n\n- The coefficient $ a_{0} $ is given by:\n$$\na_{0} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \, dx\n$$\n\n- The coefficients $ a_{n} $ and $ b_{n} $ are defined as:\n$$\na_{n} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx\n$$\n$$\nb_{n} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx\n$$\n\nfor $ n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots $.\n\nThe Fourier series is particularly useful in various fields such as signal processing, heat transfer, and vibrations, as it allows for the analysis and synthesis of periodic signals. By decomposing a complex periodic function into simpler sine and cosine components, one can analyze the frequency content of the function, which is essential in many applications.\n\nIn summary, the Fourier series provides a powerful tool for representing periodic functions, enabling the study of their properties and behaviors through harmonic analysis.
