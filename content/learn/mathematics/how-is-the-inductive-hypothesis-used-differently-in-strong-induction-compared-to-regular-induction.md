    How is the inductive hypothesis used differently in strong induction compared to regular induction?
answer: >-
    The inductive hypothesis is a crucial component in both regular induction and strong induction, but it is used differently in each case.\n\n1. **Regular Induction**: In regular induction, the inductive hypothesis assumes that the statement \(P(k)\) is true for a specific integer $k$. The goal is then to prove that this assumption allows us to conclude that the statement is also true for $k+1$. The structure can be summarized as follows:\n   - **Base Case**: Prove that \(P(n_0)\) is true for the smallest integer $n_0$.\n   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \(P(k)\) is true for some integer $k \geq n_0$, and then prove \(P(k+1)\).\n\n2. **Strong Induction**: In strong induction, the inductive hypothesis is broader. Instead of assuming just \(P(k)\), we assume that the statement holds for all integers from the base case up to $k$. This means we assume \(P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)\) are all true to prove \(P(k+1)\). The structure is as follows:\n   - **Base Case**: Prove that \(P(n_0)\) is true for the smallest integer $n_0$.\n   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \(P(i)\) is true for all integers $i$ such that $n_0 \leq i \leq k$, and then prove \(P(k+1)\).\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Scope of the Hypothesis**: Regular induction relies on the truth of a single case \(P(k)\), while strong induction relies on the truth of all previous cases \(P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)\).\n- **Usefulness**: Strong induction is particularly useful in situations where proving \(P(k+1)\) requires knowledge of multiple previous cases, not just the immediate predecessor \(P(k)\). This is often the case in problems involving sequences or recursive definitions where the next case depends on several prior cases.\n\nIn summary, the main difference lies in the breadth of the inductive hypothesis: regular induction uses a single case, while strong induction uses all cases up to $k$. This allows strong induction to handle more complex scenarios where the relationship between cases is not linear.
