    Reflections in geometry have a significant impact on the coordinates of a figure. When a figure is reflected across a specific line, the coordinates of its points change according to the line of reflection. Here are the key points regarding how reflections affect coordinates:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: The line across which the reflection occurs acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include:\n   - **Y-axis**: When a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates become \((-x, y)\). This results in a lateral inversion of the point.\n   - **X-axis**: When a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the x-axis, its new coordinates become \((x, -y)\). This flips the point vertically.\n   - **Line $y = x$**: When reflecting over the line $y = x$, the coordinates transform as follows: \(P(x, y)\) becomes \(P(y, x)\). This effectively swaps the x and y coordinates.\n\n2. **Orientation**: While the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, the orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted. For example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\).\n\n3. **Function Reflections**: In the context of functions, reflection can be expressed mathematically:\n   - To reflect a function \(y = f(x)\) over the x-axis, the transformation is given by \(y = -f(x)\).\n   - To reflect over the y-axis, the transformation is \(y = f(-x)\).\n   - A reflection over both axes can be represented as \(y = -f(-x)\).\n\n### Examples:\n- If we take the point \( (3, 4) \) and reflect it over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be \( (-3, 4) \).\n- For a function \( f(x) = x^2 \), reflecting it over the x-axis results in $ y = -x^2 $, which flips the parabola upside down.\n\n4. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the distance between points is preserved. The original figure and its reflection are congruent, maintaining the same dimensions and shape.\n\nIn summary, reflections alter the coordinates of geometric figures by inverting their positions relative to the line of reflection, while preserving their size and shape. This transformation is crucial in understanding symmetry and congruence in geometry.
