    What is the formula for the difference of squares, and how is it applied in factoring?
answer: >-
    The formula for the difference of squares is given by:\n\n$$\na^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n$$\n\nThis identity states that the difference between two squares can be factored into the product of a sum and a difference. \n\n### Application in Factoring\n\nTo apply the difference of squares in factoring, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Expression**: Look for a polynomial expression that fits the form $a^2 - b^2$. This means you need to find two terms that are perfect squares.\n\n2. **Determine $a$ and $b$**: \n   - For example, in the expression $x^2 - 4$, you can identify $a = x$ and $b = 2$ since $4$ is $2^2$.\n\n3. **Factor Using the Formula**: Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the difference of squares formula:\n   - For $x^2 - 4$, it factors to \((x + 2)(x - 2)\).\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the polynomial $x^2 - 9$:\n- Here, $a = x$ and $b = 3$ (since $9 = 3^2$).\n- Applying the difference of squares formula, we get:\n  \n$$\nx^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)\n$$\n\n### Importance\n\nThe difference of squares is particularly useful in simplifying expressions and solving polynomial equations. By factoring polynomials into simpler components, it becomes easier to find roots or further manipulate the expressions in algebraic problems. \n\nIn summary, the difference of squares formula is a powerful tool in algebra for factoring specific types of polynomial expressions efficiently.
