    How do logarithmic functions differ from exponential functions?
answer: >-
    Logarithmic functions and exponential functions are closely related but differ fundamentally in their definitions and properties.\n\n1. **Definitions**:\n   - An **exponential function** is defined as \( f(x) = b^x \), where $ b > 0 $ and $ b \neq 1 $. In this function, the base $ b $ is raised to the power of the variable $ x $.\n   - A **logarithmic function** is defined as \( g(x) = \log_b(x) \), where $ b > 0 $ and $ b \neq 1 $. This function answers the question: "To what power must the base $ b $ be raised to obtain $ x $?"\n\n2. **Inverse Relationship**:\n   - Logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions. This means that if you have an exponential equation $ b^y = x $, you can solve for $ y $ using a logarithmic function: \( y = \log_b(x) \). Conversely, if you have \( y = \log_b(x) \), you can express it in exponential form as $ b^y = x $.\n\n3. **Growth and Decay**:\n   - Exponential functions exhibit **exponential growth** or **decay**, meaning their values increase or decrease at an accelerating rate. For example, as $ x $ increases, $ b^x $ grows rapidly if $ b > 1 $.\n   - Logarithmic functions, on the other hand, represent the **inverse relationship** of exponential growth. They grow at a much slower rate compared to exponential functions. For instance, as $ x $ increases, \( \log_b(x) \) increases, but the rate of increase diminishes.\n\n4. **Applications**:\n   - Both types of functions are used in various applications, such as modeling population growth, financial investments, and in fields like differential equations. Understanding their properties is crucial for solving equations involving these functions.\n\n5. **Graphical Representation**:\n   - The graph of an exponential function rises steeply, while the graph of a logarithmic function increases gradually. This visual difference highlights their contrasting growth behaviors.\n\nIn summary, while both logarithmic and exponential functions are interconnected through their inverse relationship, they differ significantly in their definitions, growth rates, and applications.
