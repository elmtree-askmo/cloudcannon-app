    In propositional logic, the order of precedence for logical operators is crucial for determining how compound propositions are evaluated. This order dictates the sequence in which different logical operators are applied, ensuring that logical expressions are interpreted correctly. The typical order of precedence is as follows:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first. This allows for explicit control over the order of operations.\n2. **Negation (¬)**: The negation operator has the next highest precedence. It inverts the truth value of the proposition it applies to.\n3. **Conjunction (∧)**: The conjunction operator, which represents "and," is evaluated next. It returns true only if both propositions are true.\n4. **Disjunction (∨)**: The disjunction operator, representing "or," follows. It returns true if at least one of the propositions is true.\n5. **Implication (→)**: The implication operator indicates that if the first proposition is true, then the second must also be true. It is evaluated after disjunction.\n6. **Bi-implication (↔)**: The bi-implication operator indicates that both propositions are equivalent; it is evaluated last.\n\n### Application in Logical Expressions\n\nUnderstanding the order of precedence is essential for correctly interpreting logical expressions. For example, consider the expression:\n\n$$\np \land q \lor r\n$$\n\nWithout parentheses, the expression is evaluated as:\n\n1. Evaluate conjunction: $ p \land q $\n2. Then evaluate disjunction: \( (p \land q) \lor r \)\n\nIf we want to change the order of evaluation, we can use parentheses:\n\n$$\np \land (q \lor r)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the disjunction $ q \lor r $ is evaluated first, followed by the conjunction with $ p $.\n\n### Importance of Parentheses\n\nParentheses are vital in logical expressions as they clarify the intended order of operations, preventing ambiguity. For instance, the expression $ p \lor q \land r $ could yield different truth values depending on how it is evaluated, which is why parentheses are often used to ensure the correct interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the order of precedence in logical operators is fundamental for accurate logical reasoning and analysis, particularly when constructing truth tables or resolving complex logical expressions.
