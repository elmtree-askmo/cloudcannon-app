    How do the coordinates of a point change when it is rotated around the origin?
answer: >-
    When a point is rotated around the origin in a two-dimensional coordinate system, the coordinates of the point change according to the angle of rotation. Here are the transformations for common angles of rotation:\n\n1. **90 Degrees Counterclockwise**: \n   For a point \( (x, y) \), the new coordinates \( (x', y') \) after a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation are given by:\n   $$\n   x' = -y \\\n   y' = x\n   $$\n\n2. **180 Degrees**: \n   The transformation for a 180-degree rotation (either clockwise or counterclockwise) is:\n   $$\n   x' = -x \\\n   y' = -y\n   $$\n\n3. **270 Degrees Counterclockwise (or 90 Degrees Clockwise)**: \n   The new coordinates after a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation are:\n   $$\n   x' = y \\\n   y' = -x\n   $$\n\n4. **General Rotation by an Angle Î¸**: \n   For a rotation by an arbitrary angle $ \theta $ (in radians), the transformation can be expressed using trigonometric functions:\n   $$\n   x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\\n   y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)\n   $$\n\nThese formulas allow you to determine the new coordinates of a point after it has been rotated around the origin by a specified angle. Each transformation effectively changes the position of the point while maintaining its distance from the origin, thus preserving the shape and size of any geometric figure being rotated.
