    What are differentials in the context of multivariable functions?
answer: >-
    In the context of multivariable functions, differentials are an extension of the concept of differentials from single-variable calculus. They provide a way to approximate changes in a function based on changes in its input variables. \n\nFor a multivariable function \( f(x, y, z) \), the differential $ df $ can be expressed in terms of its partial derivatives with respect to each variable. The general formula for the differential is given by:\n\n$$\ndf = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} dz\n$$\n\nHere, $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} $, $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} $, and $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} $ are the partial derivatives of the function with respect to $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $, respectively. The terms $ dx $, $ dy $, and $ dz $ represent small changes in the variables $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $.\n\nThe concept of differentials is crucial for understanding how multivariable functions behave and for performing linear approximations. It allows us to analyze how small changes in input variables affect the output of the function, which is particularly useful in optimization problems and in applications across physics and engineering.\n\nIn summary, differentials in multivariable calculus serve as a tool for approximating changes in functions of multiple variables, relying on the computation of partial derivatives to express these changes in a linearized form.
