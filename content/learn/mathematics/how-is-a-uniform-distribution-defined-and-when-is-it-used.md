    How is a uniform distribution defined and when is it used?
answer: >-
    A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes have an equal likelihood of occurrence. It is characterized by two main types: discrete uniform distribution and continuous uniform distribution.\n\n1. **Discrete Uniform Distribution**: In this case, the outcomes are discrete and each outcome has the same probability. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, each face (1 through 6) has an equal probability of $ \frac{1}{6} $. The probability mass function for a discrete uniform distribution can be expressed as:\n   $$ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{n} $$\n   where $ n $ is the number of possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Continuous Uniform Distribution**: This distribution applies to continuous outcomes within a specified interval $[a, b]$. Every value within this interval is equally likely to occur. The probability density function (pdf) for a continuous uniform distribution is given by:\n   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a} \quad \text{for } a \leq x \leq b $$\n   This means that the probability of the random variable $ X $ falling between two values $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$ P(x_1 < X < x_2) = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{b - a} $$\n\n### Applications of Uniform Distribution\nUniform distributions are used in various scenarios, particularly when outcomes are equally likely. Some common applications include:\n\n- **Random Sampling**: When selecting a random sample from a population where each individual has an equal chance of being selected.\n- **Games of Chance**: Such as rolling dice or drawing cards, where each outcome is equally probable.\n- **Simulations**: In computer simulations where random numbers are generated uniformly to model real-world processes.\n- **Statistical Modeling**: In situations where a uniform distribution is a reasonable assumption for the underlying process, such as modeling the distribution of birthdays across a year.\n\nIn summary, the uniform distribution is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics, providing a basis for understanding situations where outcomes are equally likely.
