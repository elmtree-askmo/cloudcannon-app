answer: >-
    One-sided limits are a specific type of limit that examines the behavior of a function as it approaches a particular point from one direction onlyâ€”either from the left or from the right. This is particularly useful in cases where a function may behave differently depending on the direction of approach.\n\n### Definition\n- **Left-Hand Limit**: The limit of a function \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches a value $ a $ from the left (denoted as \( \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \)).\n- **Right-Hand Limit**: The limit of a function \( f(x) \) as $ x $ approaches a value $ a $ from the right (denoted as \( \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) \)).\n\n### Example\nConsider the function defined as follows:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \n\begin{cases} \n2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 3 \\\n5 & \text{if } x = 3 \\\nx^2 & \text{if } x > 3 \n\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTo find the one-sided limits as $ x $ approaches 3:\n\n1. **Left-Hand Limit**:\n   We evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) \):\n   - As $ x $ approaches 3 from the left, we use the first piece of the function:\n   $$ \n   \lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^-} (2x + 1) = 2(3) + 1 = 7 \n   $$\n\n2. **Right-Hand Limit**:\n   We evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) \):\n   - As $ x $ approaches 3 from the right, we use the third piece of the function:\n   $$ \n   \lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 3^+} (x^2) = 3^2 = 9 \n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\nIn this example, we find:\n- The left-hand limit as $ x $ approaches 3 is 7.\n- The right-hand limit as $ x $ approaches 3 is 9.\n\nSince the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are not equal, we conclude that the overall limit \( \lim_{x \to 3} f(x) \) does not exist. This illustrates how one-sided limits can provide insight into the behavior of functions at points of discontinuity.
