    What changes occur to the coordinates of a point when it is reflected?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across a specific axis, its coordinates change according to the axis of reflection. Here are the transformations for reflecting a point across the x-axis and y-axis:\n\n1. **Reflection Across the X-Axis**:\n   - If a point $P$ has coordinates \((x, y)\), when it is reflected across the x-axis, the new coordinates $P'$ will be \((x, -y)\). This means that the x-coordinate remains the same, while the y-coordinate is inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(2, 3)\), after reflection across the x-axis, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(2, -3)\).\n\n2. **Reflection Across the Y-Axis**:\n   - If a point $P$ has coordinates \((x, y)\), when it is reflected across the y-axis, the new coordinates $P'$ will be \((-x, y)\). Here, the y-coordinate remains unchanged, while the x-coordinate is inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(5, 4)\), after reflection across the y-axis, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(-5, 4)\).\n\n3. **Reflection Across Both Axes**:\n   - If a point $P$ has coordinates \((x, y)\), reflecting it across both the x-axis and y-axis results in the new coordinates \(P' = (-x, -y)\). Both coordinates are inverted.\n   - **Example**: For the point \(P(3, 4)\), after reflecting across both axes, the new point $P'$ will be \(P'(-3, -4)\).\n\nIn summary, the changes to the coordinates of a point during reflection depend on the axis of reflection:\n- Reflecting over the x-axis: \((x, y) \to (x, -y)\)\n- Reflecting over the y-axis: \((x, y) \to (-x, y)\)\n- Reflecting over both axes: \((x, y) \to (-x, -y)\)\n\nThese transformations illustrate how reflections maintain the distance from the line of reflection while altering the orientation of the point.
