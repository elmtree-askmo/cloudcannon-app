answer: >-
    Ridge and Lasso regression are two popular regularization techniques used in regression analysis to improve the performance of linear models, particularly in the presence of multicollinearity and overfitting.\n\n### Ridge Regression\nRidge regression, also known as L2 regularization, introduces a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty helps to reduce the complexity of the model by shrinking the coefficients, which can stabilize the estimates when predictor variables are highly correlated (multicollinearity). The main advantage of ridge regression is that it retains all features in the model, albeit with smaller coefficients, making it suitable for scenarios where all predictors are believed to contribute to the outcome.\n\n### Lasso Regression\nLasso regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (L1 regularization), also adds a penalty term to the cost function, but it is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This characteristic allows Lasso regression to perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, effectively removing those predictors from the model. This makes Lasso particularly useful when interpretability is important, as it simplifies the model by retaining only the most significant features.\n\n### When to Use Ridge and Lasso Regression\n- **Ridge Regression** is best suited for situations where multicollinearity is present and you want to keep all features in the model. It is effective when the goal is to improve prediction accuracy without eliminating any predictors.\n- **Lasso Regression** is ideal when feature selection is crucial, and you want a simpler model that is easier to interpret. It is particularly useful when you suspect that many predictors may not contribute significantly to the outcome.\n\nBoth techniques aim to minimize the sum of squared residuals (RSS) along with their respective penalty terms, which helps to reduce the overall mean squared error (MSE) of the model. By introducing a small amount of bias through regularization, both Ridge and Lasso regression can lead to better predictive performance compared to standard linear regression, especially in complex datasets.
