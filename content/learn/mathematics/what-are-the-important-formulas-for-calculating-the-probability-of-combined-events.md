    What are the important formulas for calculating the probability of combined events?
answer: >-
    To calculate the probability of combined events, several important formulas are utilized, depending on whether the events are independent, mutually exclusive, or dependent. Here are the key formulas:\n\n1. **Probability of a Compound Event**:\n   The probability of a compound event can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   P(\text{Compound Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}}\n   $$\n\n2. **Multiplication Rule for Independent Events**:\n   If two events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring (A and B) is given by:\n   $$\n   P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)\n   $$\n\n3. **Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events**:\n   If events A and B are dependent, the probability of both events occurring is:\n   $$\n   P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)\n   $$\n   where \(P(B|A)\) is the conditional probability of B given A has occurred.\n\n4. **Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events**:\n   If events A and B are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time), the probability of either event A or event B occurring is:\n   $$\n   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n   $$\n\n5. **Addition Rule for Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**:\n   If events A and B are not mutually exclusive (they can occur at the same time), the probability of either event A or event B occurring is:\n   $$\n   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\n   $$\n\n6. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:\n   For more than two events, the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle can be applied. For three events A, B, and C, the formula is:\n   $$\n   P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)\n   $$\n\nThese formulas provide a comprehensive framework for calculating the probabilities of combined events in various scenarios, whether they are independent, dependent, mutually exclusive, or overlapping.
