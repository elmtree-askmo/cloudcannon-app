    How do you align equations in the elimination method?
answer: >-
    To align equations in the elimination method, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the Equations in Standard Form**: Ensure both equations are in the form $ Ax + By = C $, where $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are constants. This allows for easy alignment of like terms.\n\n   For example, consider the equations:\n   $$\n   2x + 5y = 22\n   $$\n   $$\n   -3x + y = 1\n   $$\n\n2. **Align Like Terms**: Arrange the equations so that the coefficients of the variables are in the same column. This means placing all $ x $ terms in one column, all $ y $ terms in another, and the constants in a third column.\n\n3. **Multiply to Create Opposite Coefficients**: To eliminate one variable, you may need to multiply one or both equations by appropriate coefficients. The goal is to create coefficients that are opposites for one of the variables.\n\n   For instance, if you want to eliminate $ y $ in the example above, you can multiply the second equation by 5:\n   $$\n   5(-3x + y) = 5(1) \implies -15x + 5y = 5\n   $$\n\n   Now, the system of equations looks like this:\n   $$\n   2x + 5y = 22\n   $$\n   $$\n   -15x + 5y = 5\n   $$\n\n4. **Add or Subtract the Equations**: Once the coefficients are aligned, you can add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. In this case, subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate $ y $:\n   $$\n   (2x + 5y) - (-15x + 5y) = 22 - 5\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   17x = 17\n   $$\n\n5. **Solve for the Remaining Variable**: After eliminating one variable, solve for the remaining variable. In this case, dividing both sides by 17 gives:\n   $$\n   x = 1\n   $$\n\n6. **Substitute Back to Find the Other Variable**: Finally, substitute the value of $ x $ back into one of the original equations to find $ y $:\n   $$\n   2(1) + 5y = 22 \implies 5y = 20 \implies y = 4\n   $$\n\nThus, the solution to the system of equations is $ x = 1 $ and $ y = 4 $.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively align equations in the elimination method to solve systems of equations.
