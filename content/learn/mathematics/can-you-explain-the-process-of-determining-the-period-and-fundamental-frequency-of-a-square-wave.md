answer: >-
    To determine the period and fundamental frequency of a square wave, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Period**: The period of a square wave, denoted as $T_{sq}$, is the length of time it takes for the waveform to complete one full cycle. This is the time from one peak to the next peak (or from one trough to the next trough). For example, if a square wave takes 0.002 seconds to repeat itself, then $T_{sq} = 0.002$ seconds.\n\n2. **Calculate the Fundamental Frequency**: The fundamental frequency $f_{sq}$ of the square wave can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   f_{sq} = \frac{1}{T_{sq}}\n   $$\n   This means that the frequency is the reciprocal of the period. Continuing with the previous example, if $T_{sq} = 0.002$ seconds, then:\n   $$\n   f_{sq} = \frac{1}{0.002} = 500 \text{ Hz}\n   $$\n\n3. **Understanding Frequency**: The fundamental frequency represents how many times the square wave repeats itself in one second. In this case, a frequency of 500 Hz indicates that the square wave completes 500 cycles every second.\n\nIn summary, to find the period and fundamental frequency of a square wave, measure the time it takes for one complete cycle (the period) and then use the reciprocal of that period to find the frequency.
