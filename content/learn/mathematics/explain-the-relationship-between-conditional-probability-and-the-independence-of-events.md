    Explain the relationship between conditional probability and the independence of events.
answer: >-
    The relationship between conditional probability and the independence of events is fundamental in probability theory.\n\n**Conditional Probability** is defined as the probability of an event $ A $ occurring given that another event $ B $ has already occurred. This is mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\nP(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nwhere \( P(A | B) \) is the conditional probability of $ A $ given $ B $, \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability that both events occur, and \( P(B) \) is the probability of event $ B $.\n\n**Independence of Events** means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. Two events $ A $ and $ B $ are said to be independent if:\n\n$$\nP(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\n$$\n\nFrom the definitions above, we can see how conditional probability and independence are related. If events $ A $ and $ B $ are independent, then the conditional probability of $ A $ given $ B $ simplifies to:\n\n$$\nP(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)\n$$\n\nThis indicates that knowing $ B $ has occurred does not change the probability of $ A $; hence, $ A $ and $ B $ are independent.\n\nConversely, if \( P(A | B) \neq P(A) \), it implies that $ A $ and $ B $ are not independent, as the occurrence of $ B $ affects the probability of $ A $.\n\nIn summary, the key relationship is that independence of events implies that the conditional probability of one event given the other is equal to the unconditional probability of that event. If two events are independent, the occurrence of one does not provide any information about the occurrence of the other.
