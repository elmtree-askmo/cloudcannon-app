    How do cube root functions differ from square root functions in terms of perfect cubes?
answer: >-
    Cube root functions and square root functions differ significantly in their treatment of perfect cubes and their overall characteristics. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Definition and Domain**:\n   - **Cube Root Function**: The basic cube root function is defined as \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \). Its domain is all real numbers \( (-\infty, \infty) \), meaning it can accept any real number as input, including negative values.\n   - **Square Root Function**: The basic square root function is defined as \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \). Its domain is restricted to
