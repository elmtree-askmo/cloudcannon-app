    How do operations on propositions work in logic?
answer: >-
    In logic, operations on propositions are fundamental to understanding how statements can be combined and manipulated to form new propositions. A proposition is a declarative sentence that can be classified as either 'true' or 'false'. The area of logic that deals with propositions is known as propositional logic or propositional calculus.\n\nThere are several key logical operations, also referred to as logical connectives, that can be applied to propositions:\n\n1. **Conjunction (AND)**: The conjunction of two propositions $p$ and $q$ is denoted as $p \land q$. This operation is true only if both $p$ and $q$ are true. The truth table for conjunction is as follows:\n\n   | $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |\n   |-------|-------|----------------|\n   | T     | T     | T              |\n   | T     | F     | F              |\n   | F     | T     | F              |\n   | F     | F     | F              |\n\n2. **Negation (NOT)**: The negation of a proposition $p$ is denoted as $\neg p$. This operation inverts the truth value of $p$; if $p$ is true, $\neg p$ is false, and vice versa. The truth table for negation is:\n\n   | $p$ | $\neg p$ |\n   |-------|------------|\n   | T     | F          |\n   | F     | T          |\n\n3. **Disjunction (OR)**: The disjunction of two propositions $p$ and $q$ is denoted as $p \lor q$. This operation is true if at least one of $p$ or $q$ is true. The truth table for disjunction is:\n\n   | $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |\n   |-------|-------|---------------|\n   | T     | T     | T             |\n   | T     | F     | T             |\n   | F     | T     | T             |\n   | F     | F     | F             |\n\n4. **Conditional (IF...THEN)**: The conditional statement “If $p$ then $q$” is denoted as $p \rightarrow q$. This operation is false only when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. The truth table for the conditional is:\n\n   | $p$ | $q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ |\n   |-------|-------|----------------------|\n   | T     | T     | T                    |\n   | T     | F     | F                    |\n   | F     | T     | T                    |\n   | F     | F     | T                    |\n\n5. **Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF)**: The biconditional statement “$p$ if and only if $q$” is denoted as $p \leftrightarrow q$. This operation is true if both $p$ and $q$ are either 'true' or 'false'. The truth table for the biconditional is:\n\n   | $p$ | $q$ | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |\n   |-------|-------|--------------------------|\n   | T     | T     | T                        |\n   | T     | F     | F                        |\n   | F     | T     | F                        |\n   | F     | F     | T                        |\n\nThese logical operations allow for the construction of compound propositions, which are formed by combining simpler propositions using the logical connectives. Propositional logic is essential in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, as it provides a framework for reasoning about the truth values of statements and their relationships.
