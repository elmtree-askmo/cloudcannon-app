    How can you estimate the average rate of change from a graph?
answer: >-
    To estimate the average rate of change from a graph, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Two Points**: Choose two points on the graph that correspond to the interval you are interested in. These points can be represented as \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\), where $a$ and $b$ are the x-coordinates of the points.\n\n2. **Read the Coordinates**: Approximate the coordinates of these points from the graph. It is important to ensure that the points are clearly visible and accurately represent the function's values at those x-coordinates.\n\n3. **Apply the Average Rate of Change Formula**: Use the formula for the average rate of change:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n   $$\n   Here, \(f(b)\) and \(f(a)\) are the y-values of the points you selected.\n\n4. **Calculate**: Substitute the values of \(f(b)\), \(f(a)\), $b$, and $a$ into the formula and simplify to find the average rate of change over the interval.\n\n5. **Interpret the Result**: The result will give you the average change in the function's value per unit change in the input over the specified interval. A positive result indicates an increase, while a negative result indicates a decrease.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have a graph and you identify the points \((1, 3)\) and \((4, 15)\). You can calculate the average rate of change as follows:\n\n1. Identify points: \((1, 3)\) and \((4, 15)\).\n2. Apply the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{15 - 3}{4 - 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4\n   $$\n3. Interpretation: The average rate of change is 4, meaning the function increases by 4 units for every 1 unit increase in $x$ over the interval from 1 to 4.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively estimate the average rate of change from a graph for various types of functions, including quadratic and exponential functions.
