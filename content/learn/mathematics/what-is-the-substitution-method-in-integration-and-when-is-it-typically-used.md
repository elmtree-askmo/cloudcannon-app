answer: >-
    The substitution method in integration, also known as u-substitution, reverse chain rule, or change of variables, is a technique used to simplify the process of evaluating integrals. This method is particularly useful when the integrand (the function being integrated) is composed of a function and its derivative, allowing for a transformation that makes the integral easier to solve.\n\n### Definition and Purpose\nThe substitution method is based on the idea of changing the variable of integration to simplify the integral. It is analogous to the chain rule in differentiation, where you can think of it as applying the chain rule "backwards." The general form for applying the substitution method is:\n\n$$\n\int f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du\n$$\n\nwhere \( u = g(x) \) and \( du = g'(x) \, dx \).\n\n### Steps for Using the Substitution Method\n1. **Choose a Substitution**: Identify a part of the integrand to substitute with a new variable \( u \). This is often a function \( g(x) \) that simplifies the integral.\n2. **Differentiate**: Compute \( du \) by differentiating \( u \) with respect to \( x \) to find \( du = g'(x) \, dx \).\n3. **Rewrite the Integral**: Substitute \( u \) and \( du \) into the integral, transforming it into a simpler form.\n4. **Integrate**: Perform the integration with respect to \( u \).\n5. **Back Substitute**: Replace \( u \) with the original expression in terms of \( x \) to express the final answer.\n\n### When to Use the Substitution Method\nThe substitution method is typically used when:\n- The integrand is a composite function, where one part is the derivative of another part.\n- The integral can be expressed in a form that matches \( \int f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx \).\n- You can identify a substitution that simplifies the integral significantly.\n\n### Example\nConsider the integral:\n\n$$\n\int 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx\n$$\n\nHere, we can let \( u = x^2 \), which gives \( du = 2x \, dx \). The integral then becomes:\n\n$$\n\int \cos(u) \, du\n$$\n\nThis is a simpler integral to evaluate, yielding:\n\n$$\n\sin(u) + C = \sin(x^2) + C\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe substitution method is a powerful technique in calculus that allows for the simplification of integrals, making it easier to find antiderivatives. It is particularly effective when dealing with integrands that involve functions and their derivatives.
