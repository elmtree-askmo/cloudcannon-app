    The process of reflecting a point across the x-axis involves changing its y-coordinate to the negative while leaving the x-coordinate unchanged, resulting in a vertical flip of the point.

answer: >-
    Reflecting a point across the x-axis changes its coordinates by negating the y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate unchanged. \n\nMathematically, if you have a point $ P $ with coordinates \( (x, y) \), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new coordinates $ P' $ will be:\n\n$$\nP' = (x, -y)\n$$\n\nFor example, if you take a point \( P(2, 3) \), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new point $ P' $ will be:\n\n$$\nP' = (2, -3)\n$$\n\nThis transformation results in a vertical flip of the point across the x-axis, creating a mirror image of the original point with respect to that axis.
