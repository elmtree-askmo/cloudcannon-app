    What are the x-axis and y-axis used for in the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    In the coordinate plane, the x-axis and y-axis serve as the two primary reference lines that help in identifying the location of points in a two-dimensional space.\n\n1. **X-Axis**:\n   - The x-axis is the horizontal line that runs left to right. It represents the first coordinate in an ordered pair (x, y).\n   - Positive x-values are found to the right of the origin (0, 0), while negative x-values are found to the left.\n   - When plotting a point, you first move along the x-axis to the x-coordinate of the point.\n\n2. **Y-Axis**:\n   - The y-axis is the vertical line that runs up and down. It represents the second coordinate in an ordered pair (x, y).\n   - Positive y-values are located above the origin, while negative y-values are below.\n   - After reaching the correct position on the x-axis, you then move vertically along the y-axis to reach the y-coordinate of the point.\n\nTogether, these axes divide the coordinate plane into four quadrants:\n- **Quadrant I**: (x > 0, y > 0)\n- **Quadrant II**: (x < 0, y > 0)\n- **Quadrant III**: (x < 0, y < 0)\n- **Quadrant IV**: (x > 0, y < 0)\n\nUnderstanding the roles of the x-axis and y-axis is crucial for plotting points, visualizing transformations, and performing various geometric operations in the coordinate plane.
