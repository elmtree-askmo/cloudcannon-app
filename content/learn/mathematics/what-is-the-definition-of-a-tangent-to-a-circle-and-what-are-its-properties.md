    What is the definition of a tangent to a circle and what are its properties?
answer: >-
    A tangent to a circle is defined as a straight line that touches the circle at exactly one point, known as the point of tangency. At this point, the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius of the circle that extends to the point of tangency. This property is fundamental in geometry and has several important implications.\n\n### Properties of a Tangent to a Circle:\n\n1. **Point of Tangency**: A tangent line intersects the circle at precisely one point. This means that if you were to draw a line from the center of the circle to the point of tangency, it would only meet the circle at that single point.\n\n2. **Perpendicularity**: The tangent line is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. If the center of the circle is \((h, k)\) and the point of tangency is \((x_1, y_1)\), then the slope of the radius can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   m = \frac{y_1 - k}{x_1 - h}\n   $$\n   The slope of the tangent line, being perpendicular, is given by:\n   $$\n   m_{\text{tangent}} = -\frac{1}{m}\n   $$\n\n3. **External Point**: A tangent can also be defined in relation to an external point. If a point $P$ lies outside the circle, a tangent can be drawn from $P$ to the circle, touching it at a single point.\n\n4. **Length of Tangent**: The length of the tangent segment from an external point to the point of tangency can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. If the distance from the external point $P$ to the center of the circle is $d$ and the radius of the circle is $r$, then the length $L$ of the tangent segment is given by:\n   $$\n   L = \sqrt{d^2 - r^2}\n   $$\n\n5. **Tangent Line Equation**: The equation of the tangent line can be derived from the circle's equation and the coordinates of the point of tangency. For a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius $r$, the general equation of the circle is:\n   $$\n   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n   $$\n   If the point of tangency is \((x_1, y_1)\), the equation of the tangent line can be expressed in point-slope form:\n   $$\n   y - y_1 = m_{\text{tangent}}(x - x_1)\n   $$\n\n6. **Applications**: Tangents have various applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in the study of curves, optimization problems, and in the field of calculus where they are used to approximate functions.\n\nIn summary, tangents to circles are characterized by their unique point of contact, their perpendicular relationship with the radius at that point, and their mathematical properties that allow for various applications in geometry and beyond.
