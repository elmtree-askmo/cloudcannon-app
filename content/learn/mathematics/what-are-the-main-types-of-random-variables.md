    What are the main types of random variables?
answer: >-
    The main types of random variables are:\n\n1. **Discrete Random Variables**: These are random variables that can take on a countable number of distinct values. The set of possible values can be finite or countably infinite. For example, the outcome of rolling a die (which can result in one of the six faces) is a discrete random variable. Other examples include the number of heads in a series of coin flips or the number of defective items in a batch.\n\n2. **Continuous Random Variables**: These random variables can take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range. They are often used to represent measurements or quantities. Examples include height, weight, and the time required to complete a task. Continuous random variables are typically represented by intervals, and the probability of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value is technically zero.\n\n3. **Mixed Random Variables**: These random variables have both discrete and continuous components. They do not have a cumulative distribution function that is purely discrete or continuous. An example of a mixed random variable could be the wait time in a queue, where there are specific discrete wait times (like 1 minute, 2 minutes) but also a continuous range of possible wait times.\n\nUnderstanding these types of random variables is crucial for analyzing data and applying statistical methods effectively.
