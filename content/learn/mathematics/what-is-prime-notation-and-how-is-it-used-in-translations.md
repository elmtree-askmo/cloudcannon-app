answer: >-
    Prime notation is a mathematical convention used to denote the images of points or figures after a transformation, particularly in translations. In this context, the original points or figures are labeled with standard letters (e.g., A, B, C), while the corresponding points or figures after the translation are labeled with the same letters followed by a prime symbol (e.g., A', B', C'). This notation helps to clearly distinguish between the original pre-image and the translated image.\n\nFor example, if point A is translated to a new position, it would be represented as A' to indicate that it is the image of the original point A after the translation. This use of prime notation is particularly useful in geometric transformations, as it allows for easy identification of relationships between the original and transformed figures.\n\nIn translations, the movement of each point is described by a specific rule, often expressed in the form of a mapping rule. For instance, a translation can be represented as:\n\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + a, y + b)$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the horizontal and vertical shifts, respectively. If point A has coordinates (x, y) and is translated according to this rule, its new coordinates would be (x + a, y + b), and it would be labeled as A'.\n\nIn summary, prime notation is essential in translations as it provides a clear and concise way to represent the relationship between original points and their translated images, facilitating the understanding of geometric transformations.
