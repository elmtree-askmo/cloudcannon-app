    A sequence is considered bounded if there exists a real number M such that the absolute value of each term is less than or equal to M for all positive integers n. It must have both upper and lower bounds.

    What are the criteria for a sequence to be considered bounded?
answer: >-
    A sequence $\{x_n\}$ is considered bounded if there exists a real number $M > 0$ such that the absolute value of each term in the sequence is less than or equal to $M$ for all positive integers $n$. This can be formally expressed as:\n\n$$\n|x_n| \leq M \quad \text{for all } n \in \mathbb{N}^+.\n$$\n\nIn more specific terms, a sequence is bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below. This means:\n\n1. **Bounded Above**: There exists a real number $M$ such that $x_n \leq M$ for all $n$.\n2. **Bounded Below**: There exists a real number $m$ such that $x_n \geq m$ for all $n$.\n\nIf a sequence does not meet these criteria, it is classified as unbounded. For example, the sequence $\{1/n\}$ is bounded above by 1, as $1/n \leq 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Conversely, a sequence like $\{n\}$ is unbounded because it does not have an upper limit.\n\nIn summary, the criteria for a sequence to be considered bounded are:\n\n- There exists a real number $M$ such that all terms of the sequence are confined within the range $[-M, M]$.\n- The sequence must have both an upper and a lower bound. \n\nThis understanding is crucial in mathematical analysis, particularly when discussing convergence and the behavior of sequences.
