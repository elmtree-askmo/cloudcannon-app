    How do you convert liters to milliliters?
answer: >-
    To convert liters to milliliters, you can follow a straightforward process based on the metric system's prefixes and the movement of the decimal point.\n\n1. **Identify the Units**: You are converting from liters (L) to milliliters (mL).\n2. **Understand the Relationship**: In the metric system, 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters. This means that to convert liters to milliliters, you need to move the decimal point three places to the right.\n3. **Perform the Conversion**:\n   - For example, if you want to convert 15 liters to milliliters:\n     - Start with 15 liters.\n     - Move the decimal point three places to the right: $15 \rightarrow 15,000$.\n   - Therefore, $15 \text{ liters} = 15,000 \text{ milliliters}$.\n\n### Summary of the Conversion Process:\n- **Conversion Factor**: 1 L = 1,000 mL\n- **Decimal Movement**: Move the decimal point three places to the right for liters to milliliters.\n\nThis method can be applied to any quantity of liters to find the equivalent in milliliters. For instance:\n- $1 \text{ L} = 1,000 \text{ mL}$\n- $2.5 \text{ L} = 2.5 \times 1,000 = 2,500 \text{ mL}$\n- $0.75 \text{ L} = 0.75 \times 1,000 = 750 \text{ mL}$\n\nUnderstanding this conversion is essential for accurate measurements in cooking, science, and various applications where liquid volumes are involved.
