    How is a vector represented in a three-dimensional coordinate system?
answer: >-
    In a three-dimensional coordinate system, a vector is represented by its components along the three axes: x, y, and z. Each vector can be expressed in terms of these components and the corresponding unit vectors. The general representation of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in three-dimensional space is given by:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{v} = v_x \mathbf{i} + v_y \mathbf{j} + v_z \mathbf{k}\n$$\n\nHere:\n- $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ are the components of the vector along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.\n- $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ are the unit vectors in the directions of the x, y, and z axes.\n\nFor example, if a vector has components $v_x = 3$, $v_y = 4$, and $v_z = 5$, it can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{v} = 3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j} + 5\mathbf{k}\n$$\n\nThis representation allows for various vector operations, such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, to be performed using the individual components. The geometric interpretation of vectors in three-dimensional space is essential for understanding physical phenomena, as it provides a clear way to visualize direction and magnitude in a three-dimensional context.
