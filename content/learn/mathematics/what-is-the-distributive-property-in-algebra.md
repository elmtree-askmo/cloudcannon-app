    What is the distributive property in algebra?
answer: >-
    The distributive property is a fundamental principle in algebra that allows for the simplification of expressions involving multiplication and addition (or subtraction). It states that when you multiply a number by a sum (or difference), you can distribute the multiplication across each term within the parentheses. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\na \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c\n$$\n\nThis means that you multiply $a$ by both $b$ and $c$ separately and then add (or subtract) the results.\n\nFor example, if you have the expression \(3(4 + 5)\), using the distributive property, you would calculate it as follows:\n\n$$\n3(4 + 5) = 3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 5 = 12 + 15 = 27\n$$\n\nThe distributive property is particularly useful in algebra for simplifying complex expressions and solving equations. It can also be applied to polynomials, where you distribute a term across multiple terms in a polynomial. For instance, in the expression \(2(x + 3) + 4(x + 1)\), you would apply the distributive property as follows:\n\n$$\n2(x + 3) + 4(x + 1) = 2x + 6 + 4x + 4 = 6x + 10\n$$\n\nIn summary, the distributive property is a powerful tool in algebra that simplifies calculations by allowing you to break down expressions into more manageable parts, making it easier to solve equations and combine like terms.
