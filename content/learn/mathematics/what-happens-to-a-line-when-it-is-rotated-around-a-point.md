    What happens to a line when it is rotated around a point?
answer: >-
    When a line is rotated around a point, several key transformations occur depending on the angle and direction of the rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise). Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. **Center of Rotation**: The point around which the line is rotated is known as the center of rotation. This point remains fixed during the rotation.\n\n2. **Angle of Rotation**: The line is turned by a specified angle. Common angles include 90°, 180°, and 270°. The direction of rotation can be either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n3. **Transformation of Points**: Each point on the line follows a circular arc around the center of rotation. The new position of each point can be calculated using rotation formulas. For example:\n   - A 90° counterclockwise rotation of a point \((x, y)\) around the origin transforms it to \((-y, x)\).\n   - A 180° rotation transforms \((x, y)\) to \((-x, -y)\).\n\n4. **New Line Position**: After rotation, the line may change its position, orientation, and potentially its intersection with other lines. If the original line and the rotated line intersect, the intersection point will be a point that lies on both lines.\n\n5. **Reflection and Symmetry**: If the line is rotated by 180°, it will be reflected through the center of rotation, effectively creating a mirror image of the original line.\n\n6. **Geometric Properties**: The size and shape of the line remain unchanged, but its orientation and position in the coordinate plane will differ based on the angle and direction of rotation.\n\n7. **Example**: If a horizontal line segment is rotated 90° counterclockwise around the origin, the endpoints of the line segment will move to new coordinates, effectively transforming the horizontal line into a vertical line.\n\nIn summary, rotating a line around a point results in a new line that maintains the same length but may occupy a different position and orientation in the plane, depending on the angle and direction of rotation.
