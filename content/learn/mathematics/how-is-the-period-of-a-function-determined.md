    How is the period of a function determined?
answer: >-
    The period of a function is determined by identifying the smallest interval over which the function repeats itself. Here are the steps to determine the period of a periodic function:\n\n1. **Definition of Periodicity**: A function \( f(x) \) is considered periodic if there exists a positive number $ p $ such that:\n   $$ \n   f(x + p) = f(x) \n   $$\n   for all $ x $ in the domain of $ f $. The smallest such $ p $ is called the period of the function.\n\n2. **Identifying Repeating Patterns**: To find the period, observe the function's graph or its algebraic expression to identify any repeating patterns. For example, trigonometric functions like sine and cosine have standard periods:\n   - The sine function \( \sin(x) \) and cosine function \( \cos(x) \) both have a period of $ 2\pi $.\n   - If the function is of the form \( \sin(Bx) \) or \( \cos(Bx) \), the period changes to:\n   $$\n   \text{Period} = \frac{2\pi}{|B|}\n   $$\n   where $ B $ is the coefficient of $ x $. If $ B $ is greater than 1, the function completes its cycle more frequently.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation**: Graphically, the period can be visualized as the distance along the x-axis over which the function's shape repeats. For example, if a function returns to the same value and slope after a certain distance, that distance is its period.\n\n4. **Examples of Common Periods**:\n   - The tangent function \( \tan(x) \) has a period of $ \pi $.\n   - For a general sine or cosine function expressed as \( f(x) = A \sin(Bx + C) + D \), the period is given by $ \frac{2\pi}{|B|} $.\n\n5. **Fundamental Period**: The smallest positive value of $ p $ that satisfies the periodic condition is referred to as the fundamental period of the function.\n\nBy following these steps, one can effectively determine the period of various periodic functions.
