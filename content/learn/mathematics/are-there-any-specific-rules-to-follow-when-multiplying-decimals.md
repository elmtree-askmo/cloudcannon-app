    When multiplying decimals, there are specific rules and steps to follow to ensure accuracy. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Ignore the Decimal Point**: Treat the decimal number as if it were a whole number by temporarily ignoring the decimal point. This simplifies the multiplication process.\n\n2. **Multiply as Whole Numbers**: Perform the multiplication as you would with whole numbers. For example, if you are multiplying 0.2 by 3, you would calculate it as 2 × 3 = 6.\n\n3. **Count Decimal Places**: After multiplying, count the total number of decimal places in both of the original numbers. This is crucial for placing the decimal point in the final product correctly.\n\n4. **Reinsert the Decimal Point**: The number of decimal places in the product should equal the total number of decimal places counted from both original numbers. For instance, if you multiplied 0.2 (one decimal place) by 3 (zero decimal places), the product should have one decimal place, resulting in 0.6.\n\n5. **Example**: To illustrate, let's multiply 1.21 by 3:\n   - Step 1: Ignore the decimal: 121 × 3 = 363.\n   - Step 2: Count the decimal places: 1.21 has two decimal places, and 3 has none, totaling two decimal places.\n   - Step 3: Place the decimal point: The final answer is 3.63.\n\n6. **Practice Activity**: To reinforce these concepts, practice multiplying various decimal numbers with whole numbers and two decimal numbers. For example, try multiplying 0.75 by 6 or 0.22 by 102, following the steps outlined above.\n\nBy adhering to these rules, you can effectively multiply decimals and ensure your calculations are accurate.
