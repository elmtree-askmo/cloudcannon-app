    In calculus, functions can be classified as continuous or discontinuous based on their behavior at specific points. Here are examples of both types of functions:\n\n### Continuous Functions\n1. **Polynomial Functions**: A simple example is the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). This function is continuous everywhere on the real number line, meaning there are no breaks, jumps, or holes in its graph.\n\n2. **Trigonometric Functions**: The sine function, \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), is continuous for all real numbers. Its graph is smooth and has no interruptions.\n\n3. **Exponential Functions**: The function \( f(x) = e^x \) is continuous for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Like polynomial and trigonometric functions, it can be drawn without lifting the pencil.\n\n### Discontinuous Functions\n1. **Rational Functions**: Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). This function is continuous on the intervals \( (0, \infty) \) and \( (-\infty, 0) \), but it is discontinuous at \( x = 0 \) where it has an infinite discontinuity due to a vertical asymptote.\n\n2. **Piecewise Functions**: An example is the function defined as:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   x^2 & \text{if } x < 1 \\\n   3 & \text{if } x = 1 \\\n   x + 1 & \text{if } x > 1 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   This function is discontinuous at \( x = 1 \) because the left-hand limit (approaching from values less than 1) is \( 1 \) while the function value at \( x = 1 \) is \( 3 \).\n\n3. **Thomae's Function**: This function is defined as:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   \frac{1}{q} & \text{if } x = \frac{p}{q} \text{ in lowest terms} \\\n   0 & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational} \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n   Thomae's function is continuous at all irrational points and discontinuous at all rational points. It is an interesting example of a function that is continuous at uncountably many points while being discontinuous at countably many points.\n\n### Summary\nA function is considered continuous at a point \( a \) if:\n1. The limit \( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \) exists.\n2. The function value \( f(a) \) is defined.\n3. The limit equals the function value, i.e., \( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) \).\n\nConversely, a function is discontinuous at a point if any of these conditions fail. Understanding these examples helps clarify the concepts of continuity and discontinuity in calculus.
