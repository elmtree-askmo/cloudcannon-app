    What happens to the coordinates of a point when it is reflected across the y-axis?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across the y-axis, the transformation affects the coordinates of the point in a specific way. \n\nFor a point $ P $ with coordinates \( (x, y) \), after reflecting it across the y-axis, the new coordinates $ P' $ will be \( (-x, y) \). This means that the x-coordinate is negated (flipped to the opposite side of the y-axis), while the y-coordinate remains unchanged.\n\n### Example:\n- If we take the point \( (3, 4) \) and reflect it over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be \( (-3, 4) \).\n- Similarly, if the point is \( (-2, 5) \), after reflection across the y-axis, it will become \( (2, 5) \).\n\n### Summary:\n- **Original Point**: \( (x, y) \)\n- **Reflected Point**: \( (-x, y) \)\n\nThis transformation is a type of rigid motion, meaning that the shape and size of the figure remain unchanged, but the orientation is laterally inverted.
