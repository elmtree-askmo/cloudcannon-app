    What are the properties of function addition and subtraction?
answer: >-
    The properties of function addition and subtraction are fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly in the study of functions. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of these properties:\n\n### 1. Definition of Function Addition and Subtraction\n- **Addition of Functions**: If you have two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), the sum of these functions is defined as:\n  $$(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$$\n  \n- **Subtraction of Functions**: Similarly, the difference of two functions is defined as:\n  $$(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$$\n\n### 2. Properties of Function Addition\n- **Commutative Property**: The order in which you add functions does not matter:\n  $$f + g = g + f$$\n  \n- **Associative Property**: When adding multiple functions, the grouping does not affect the result:\n  $$(f + g) + h = f + (g + h)$$\n\n### 3. Properties of Function Subtraction\n- **Non-Commutative**: Unlike addition, the order of subtraction matters:\n  $$f - g \neq g - f$$\n  \n- **Associative Property**: Subtraction is not associative:\n  $$(f - g) - h \neq f - (g - h)$$\n\n### 4. Domain Considerations\n- The domain of the resulting function from addition or subtraction is the intersection of the domains of the original functions. This means that the new function is only defined for values of $ x $ that are in both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).\n\n### 5. Examples\n- **Addition Example**:\n  Let \( f(x) = 2x - 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 8 \).\n  To find \( (f + g)(x) \):\n  $$(f + g)(x) = (2x - 7) + (5x + 8) = 7x + 1$$\n\n- **Subtraction Example**:\n  Using the same functions:\n  To find \( (f - g)(x) \):\n  $$(f - g)(x) = (2x - 7) - (5x + 8) = 2x - 7 - 5x - 8 = -3x - 15$$\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, function addition and subtraction follow specific properties that are similar to basic arithmetic operations. Understanding these properties is crucial for performing operations on functions effectively. The commutative and associative properties apply to addition, while subtraction is non-commutative and not associative. Always consider the domain when performing these operations to ensure the resulting function is valid.
