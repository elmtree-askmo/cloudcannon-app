answer: >-
    Integration by parts is a fundamental technique in calculus used to integrate the product of two functions. The process is based on the product rule for differentiation and is particularly useful when the integrand is a product of functions that are difficult to integrate directly.\n\n### Formula\nThe integration by parts formula is given by:\n\n$$\n\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du,\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( u \) is a function that you choose to differentiate,\n- \( dv \) is the remaining part of the integrand that you will integrate,\n- \( du \) is the derivative of \( u \),\n- \( v \) is the integral of \( dv \).\n\n### Purpose\nThe primary purpose of integration by parts is to transform a complex integral into a simpler one. By selecting \( u \) and \( dv \) wisely, you can often replace a difficult integral with one that is easier to evaluate. This technique is especially effective when dealing with products of polynomial and exponential functions, logarithmic functions, or trigonometric functions.\n\n### Process\n1. **Choose \( u \) and \( dv \)**: Identify parts of the integrand to assign to \( u \) and \( dv \). A common mnemonic for choosing \( u \) is LIATE (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential), which suggests the order of preference for choosing \( u \).\n\n2. **Differentiate and Integrate**: Compute \( du \) (the derivative of \( u \)) and \( v \) (the integral of \( dv \)).\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Substitute \( u \), \( du \), \( v \), and \( dv \) into the integration by parts formula.\n\n4. **Simplify**: Evaluate the resulting integral, which should ideally be simpler than the original.\n\n### Example\nConsider the integral \( \int x e^x \, dx \).\n\n1. Choose \( u = x \) and \( dv = e^x \, dx \).\n2. Then, \( du = dx \) and \( v = e^x \).\n3. Applying the formula:\n   $$\n   \int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx.\n   $$\n4. The remaining integral \( \int e^x \, dx = e^x \), so:\n   $$\n   \int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C = e^x (x - 1) + C,\n   $$\nwhere \( C \) is the constant of integration.\n\n### Conclusion\nIntegration by parts is a powerful technique that allows for the integration of products of functions by transforming them into simpler integrals. Mastery of this method opens up a wider range of integrals that can be evaluated, making it an essential tool in calculus.
