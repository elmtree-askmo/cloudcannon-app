    What are the different types of intercepts in a function's graph?
answer: >-
    In the context of graphing functions, there are two primary types of intercepts: the x-intercept and the y-intercept.\n\n1. **X-Intercept**: The x-intercept is the point on the graph where the function crosses the x-axis. At this point, the value of y is zero. To find the x-intercept(s) of a function, you set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. The solutions you obtain will give you the x-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the x-axis.\n\n2. **Y-Intercept**: The y-intercept is the point on the graph where the function crosses the y-axis. At this point, the value of x is zero. To find the y-intercept(s), you set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. The solutions will provide the y-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the y-axis.\n\nFor example, consider the function $y = x^2 - 4$:\n- To find the x-intercepts, set $y = 0$:\n  $$0 = x^2 - 4 \implies x^2 = 4 \implies x = 2 \text{ or } x = -2$$\n  Thus, the x-intercepts are \((2, 0)\) and \((-2, 0)\).\n\n- To find the y-intercept, set $x = 0$:\n  $$y = 0^2 - 4 = -4$$\n  Thus, the y-intercept is \((0, -4)\).\n\nThese intercepts are crucial for graphing linear equations and other types of functions, as they provide key points that help define the shape and position of the graph.
