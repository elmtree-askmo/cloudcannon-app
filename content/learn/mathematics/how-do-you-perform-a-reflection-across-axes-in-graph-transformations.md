    How do you perform a reflection across axes in graph transformations?
answer: >-
    To perform a reflection across the axes in graph transformations, you need to understand how the coordinates of points on the graph change based on the axis of reflection.\n\n### Reflection Across the X-Axis\nWhen reflecting a graph across the \(x\)-axis, each point \((x, y)\) on the graph is transformed to \((x, -y)\). This means that the \(y\)-coordinates of all points are multiplied by \(-1\). The resulting graph is a mirror image of the original graph with respect to the \(x\)-axis.\n\n**Example:**\nIf you have a point \(P(2, 3)\) on the graph of a function \(f(x)\), after reflecting across the \(x\)-axis, the new point \(P'\) will be \(P'(2, -3)\).\n\n### Reflection Across the Y-Axis\nWhen reflecting a graph across the \(y\)-axis, each point \((x, y)\) is transformed to \((-x, y)\). In this case, the \(x\)-coordinates of all points are multiplied by \(-1\). The resulting graph is a mirror image of the original graph with respect to the \(y\)-axis.\n\n**Example:**\nFor a point \(P(2, 3)\) on the graph of a function \(f(x)\), after reflecting across the \(y\)-axis, the new point \(P'\) will be \(P'(-2, 3)\).\n\n### Summary of Transformations\n- **Reflection across the \(x\)-axis:** \n  - Transformation: \(f(x) \to -f(x)\)\n  - Example: If \(f(x) = x^2\), then the reflection is \(f(x) = -x^2\).\n\n- **Reflection across the \(y\)-axis:** \n  - Transformation: \(f(x) \to f(-x)\)\n  - Example: If \(f(x) = x^2\), then the reflection is \(f(x) = (-x)^2 = x^2\) (which remains unchanged for even functions).\n\n### Visual Representation\nIn a graph, these reflections can be visualized as flipping the graph over the respective axes. This type of transformation is known as a rigid transformation, meaning the shape and size of the graph remain unchanged, only its position in the coordinate plane is altered.\n\nUnderstanding these transformations is crucial for graphing functions and analyzing their properties, such as symmetry and behavior under various transformations.
