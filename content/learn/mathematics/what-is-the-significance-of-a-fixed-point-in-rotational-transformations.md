    The significance of a fixed point in rotational transformations is crucial for understanding how geometric figures behave under rotation. Here are the key points regarding the role of a fixed point:\n\n1. **Definition of Fixed Point**: In the context of rotation, a fixed point (also known as the center of rotation) is the point around which the rotation occurs. This point remains unchanged during the transformation, meaning that it does not move when the figure is rotated.\n\n2. **Angle of Rotation**: The angle of rotation determines how far the figure is turned around the fixed point. For example, if a point A is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around a fixed point P, the new position of point A will be A', while point P remains stationary.\n\n3. **Rotational Symmetry**: A geometric figure has rotational symmetry about a fixed point if it can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and still look the same. The fixed point is essential in defining this symmetry, as it serves as the reference point for the rotation.\n\n4. **Mathematical Representation**: The transformation can be mathematically represented. For instance, when rotating a point (x, y) around the origin by an angle Î¸, the new coordinates (x', y') can be calculated using the rotation formulas:\n   $$\n   x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\\n   y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)\n   $$\n\n5. **Properties of Rotations**: The image and pre-image of a rotated object maintain certain properties. For example, if two parallel lines are rotated about a fixed point, their images remain parallel. This consistency is a direct result of the fixed point's role in the transformation.\n\n6. **Applications in Geometry**: Understanding fixed points is essential for classifying rigid motions in geometry, which include translations, rotations, and reflections. Each type of transformation has distinct characteristics regarding its fixed points, which can help in analyzing and solving geometric problems.\n\nIn summary, the fixed point in rotational transformations serves as the anchor around which the entire figure rotates, influencing the resulting positions of all other points in the figure while remaining unchanged itself. This concept is fundamental in both theoretical and practical applications of geometry.
