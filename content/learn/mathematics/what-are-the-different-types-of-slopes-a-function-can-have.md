    What are the different types of slopes a function can have?
answer: >-
    A function can exhibit four main types of slopes, each indicating a different behavior of the function over an interval:\n\n1. **Positive Slope**: This occurs when the function is increasing. As the input (x) increases, the output (y) also increases. For example, in a linear function like $y = 2x + 1$, the slope is positive, indicating that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ increases by 2.\n\n2. **Negative Slope**: This indicates that the function is decreasing. As the input increases, the output decreases. An example of this is the linear function $y = -3x + 5$, where the slope is negative, meaning that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ decreases by 3.\n\n3. **Zero Slope**: A function has a zero slope when it is constant over an interval. This means that the output does not change as the input changes. For instance, the function $y = 4$ has a slope of zero, as it remains constant regardless of the value of $x$.\n\n4. **Undefined Slope**: This occurs in the case of a vertical line, where the change in the input (x) is zero. Since the slope is calculated as the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$, a vertical line results in division by zero, which is undefined. An example is the line represented by $x = 2$.\n\nUnderstanding these types of slopes is crucial for analyzing the behavior of functions across different intervals, as they provide insights into whether a function is increasing, decreasing, constant, or exhibiting vertical behavior.
