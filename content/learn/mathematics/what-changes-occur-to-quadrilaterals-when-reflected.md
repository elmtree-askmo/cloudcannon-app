    What changes occur to quadrilaterals when reflected?
answer: >-
    When quadrilaterals are reflected across a line, several changes occur, while some properties remain constant. Here are the key changes and characteristics of quadrilaterals during reflection:\n\n1. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, meaning that the size and shape of the quadrilateral remain unchanged. The reflected image is congruent to the original quadrilateral.\n\n2. **Orientation**: The most significant change during reflection is the orientation of the quadrilateral. The reflected image is laterally inverted, meaning that the order of the vertices is reversed. For example, if the original quadrilateral has vertices labeled in a clockwise order, the reflected quadrilateral will have its vertices labeled in a counterclockwise order (or vice versa).\n\n3. **Line of Reflection**: The line across which the reflection occurs is known as the line of reflection or mirror line. Common lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and any other line in the coordinate plane. The position of the line of reflection determines how the quadrilateral is flipped.\n\n4. **Coordinates Transformation**: The coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral change based on the line of reflection. For instance:\n   - If a quadrilateral is reflected over the y-axis, a point \(P(x, y)\) will transform to \((-x, y)\).\n   - If reflected over the x-axis, the point will transform to \((x, -y)\).\n   - If reflected over the line $y = x$, the point will transform to \((y, x)\).\n\n5. **Distance Preservation**: The distance between any two points in the quadrilateral remains the same before and after reflection. This property is crucial in maintaining the congruence of the original and reflected figures.\n\n### Example:\nConsider a quadrilateral with vertices at \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), \(C(5, 2)\), and \(D(3, 0)\). If this quadrilateral is reflected over the y-axis, the new coordinates of the vertices will be:\n- \(A'(-1, 2)\)\n- \(B'(-3, 4)\)\n- \(C'(-5, 2)\)\n- \(D'(-3, 0)\)\n\nIn summary, when quadrilaterals are reflected, they maintain their size and shape, but their orientation is reversed, and their coordinates change according to the line of reflection. The properties of distance and congruence are preserved throughout the transformation.
