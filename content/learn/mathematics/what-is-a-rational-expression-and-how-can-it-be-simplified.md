    What is a rational expression and how can it be simplified?
answer: >-
    A rational expression is a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. It can be represented in the form \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials and \( Q(x) \neq 0 \). For example, the expression $ \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1} $ is a rational expression.\n\nTo simplify a rational expression, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Numerator and Denominator**: Start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator as much as possible. For instance, in the expression $ \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1} $, the numerator can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \).\n\n2. **Cancel Common Factors**: After factoring, look for any common factors in the numerator and denominator that can be canceled. In our example, the \( (x + 1) \) in the numerator and denominator can be canceled, leading to:\n   $$\n   \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{(x + 1)} = x - 1 \quad \text{for } x \neq -1.\n   $$\n\n3. **State Restrictions**: It's important to note any restrictions on the variable that arise from the original expression. In this case, since $ x + 1 $ cannot be zero, we have the restriction $ x \neq -1 $.\n\n4. **Final Expression**: The simplified form of the rational expression is now $ x - 1 $, valid for $ x \neq -1 $.\n\nRational expressions can also be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, similar to regular fractions, making them a fundamental part of algebra for solving equations and modeling various situations.
