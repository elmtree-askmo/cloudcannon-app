    How do you interpret changes in coordinates when a figure is translated?
answer: >-
    When a figure is translated in the coordinate plane, the changes in coordinates can be interpreted as a systematic shift of each point of the figure by a specific distance in a given direction. This process is a type of rigid transformation, meaning that the shape and size of the figure remain unchanged, but its position does.\n\n### Understanding Translation\n\n1. **Translation Vector**: A translation can be described using a vector, typically denoted as $(dx, dy)$, where:\n   - $dx$ is the change in the x-coordinate.\n   - $dy$ is the change in the y-coordinate.\n\n2. **New Coordinates**: If a point \( P(x, y) \) is translated by the vector $(dx, dy)$, the new coordinates \( P'(x', y') \) of the point after translation can be calculated using the following formulas:\n   $$\n   x' = x + dx \\\n   y' = y + dy\n   $$\n\n3. **Effect on Figures**: When translating a geometric figure, each vertex of the figure undergoes the same translation. For example, if a triangle has vertices at \( A(x_1, y_1) \), \( B(x_2, y_2) \), and \( C(x_3, y_3) \), and it is translated by $(dx, dy)$, the new vertices will be:\n   - \( A'(x_1 + dx, y_1 + dy) \)\n   - \( B'(x_2 + dx, y_2 + dy) \)\n   - \( C'(x_3 + dx, y_3 + dy) \)\n\n### Visualizing Translation\n\nIn a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, the x-axis and y-axis are orthogonal, and the translation can be visualized as moving the entire figure along the plane without altering its orientation or dimensions. This means that the relative positions of the points within the figure remain constant.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, when a figure is translated, each point's coordinates are adjusted according to the translation vector, resulting in a new position for the figure while maintaining its original shape and size. This concept is fundamental in understanding geometric transformations and is widely applicable in various fields, including computer graphics, robotics, and physics.
