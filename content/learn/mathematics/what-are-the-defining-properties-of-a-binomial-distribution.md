    What are the defining properties of a binomial distribution?
answer: >-
    The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. Here are the defining properties of a binomial distribution:\n\n1. **Two Possible Outcomes**: Each trial has only two possible outcomes, commonly referred to as "success" and "failure." These outcomes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.\n\n2. **Fixed Number of Trials**: The number of trials, denoted as $ n $, is fixed in advance. \n\n3. **Constant Probability**: The probability of success, denoted as $ p $, remains constant for each trial. Consequently, the probability of failure, denoted as $ q $, is given by $ q = 1 - p $.\n\n4. **Independence of Trials**: The trials are independent, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another.\n\n5. **Probability Mass Function**: The probability of obtaining exactly $ x $ successes in $ n $ trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n   $$\n   P(X = x) = \binom{n}{x} p^x q^{n-x}\n   $$\n   where $ \binom{n}{x} $ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \( \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \).\n\n6. **Mean and Variance**: The mean (expected value) and variance of a binomial distribution can be calculated using the following formulas:\n   - Mean: $ \mu = np $\n   - Variance: $ \sigma^2 = npq $\n   - Standard Deviation: $ \sigma = \sqrt{npq} $\n\nThese properties make the binomial distribution applicable in various real-life scenarios, such as flipping a coin, quality control in manufacturing, and any situation where there are a fixed number of trials with two possible outcomes.
