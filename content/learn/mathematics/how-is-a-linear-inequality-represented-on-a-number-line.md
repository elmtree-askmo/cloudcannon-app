    How is a linear inequality represented on a number line?
answer: >-
    A linear inequality can be represented on a number line by following a systematic approach. Here’s how to do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Solve the Inequality**: Start by solving the linear inequality to determine the range of values that satisfy it. For example, consider the inequality $2x + 3 \leq 9$. To solve for $x$, you would isolate it as follows:\n   $$\n   2x + 3 \leq 9 \\\n   2x \leq 6 \\\n   x \leq 3\n   $$\n\n2. **Identify the Boundary Point**: The solution $x \leq 3$ indicates that $3$ is a boundary point. Since the inequality includes the equal sign (≤), this point is included in the solution set.\n\n3. **Draw the Number Line**: Create a horizontal line representing the number line. Mark the boundary point $3$ on this line.\n\n4. **Use Open or Closed Circles**: \n   - If the inequality is strict (e.g., $x < 3$ or $x > 3$), use an open circle at the boundary point to indicate that it is not included in the solution.\n   - If the inequality is non-strict (e.g., $x \leq 3$ or $x \geq 3$), use a closed circle to indicate that the boundary point is included.\n\n5. **Shade the Appropriate Region**: \n   - For $x \leq 3$, shade to the left of $3$ on the number line to indicate that all values less than or equal to $3$ are part of the solution set.\n   - For $x > 3$, shade to the right of $3$.\n\n### Example Representation\nFor the inequality $x \leq 3$, the representation on the number line would look like this:\n\n```\n<---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->\n    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9\n          ●========================>\n```\nIn this representation:\n- The closed circle at $3$ indicates that $3$ is included in the solution.\n- The shaded line to the left indicates all values less than or equal to $3$ are part of the solution set.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- For inequalities like $x \neq \frac{1}{3}$, you would represent it by marking an open circle at $\frac{1}{3}$ and shading the entire number line except for that point.\n- Always ensure to clearly label the number line and the shaded regions to avoid confusion.\n\nThis method allows for a clear visual representation of the solution set for linear inequalities on a number line.
