    Can you provide a practice problem involving the surface area of a cube?
answer: >-
    Here is a practice problem involving the surface area of a cube:\n\n**Problem:**\nA cube has a side length of 5 cm. Calculate the total surface area of the cube.\n\n**Solution:**\nTo find the surface area of a cube, we use the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Surface Area} = 6a^2\n$$\n\nwhere $ a $ is the length of one side of the cube.\n\nGiven that $ a = 5 $ cm, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Surface Area} = 6(5)^2 = 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ cm}^2\n$$\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the cube is **150 cmÂ²**.\n\nFeel free to try another problem or ask for more examples!
