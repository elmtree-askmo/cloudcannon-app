    What are the key properties of a probability distribution function?
answer: >-
    The key properties of a probability distribution function (PDF) are essential for understanding how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes of a random variable. Here are the main properties:\n\n1. **Non-negativity**: For any value \( x \), the probability density function \( f(x) \) must be non-negative:\n   $$\n   f(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } x\n   $$\n\n2. **Normalization**: The total area under the probability density function must equal 1. This ensures that the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes is 1:\n   $$\n   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1\n   $$\n\n3. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: The cumulative distribution function \( F(x) \) is defined as the integral of the PDF from negative infinity to \( x \):\n   $$\n   F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) \, dt\n   $$\n   The CDF gives the probability that a random variable \( X \) is less than or equal to \( x \):\n   $$\n   P(X \leq x) = F(x)\n   $$\n\n4. **Right-continuity**: The cumulative distribution function \( F(x) \) is right-continuous, meaning that:\n   $$\n   \lim_{h \to 0^+} F(x + h) = F(x)\n   $$\n\n5. **Limits**: The CDF has specific limits as \( x \) approaches negative and positive infinity:\n   - As \( x \) approaches negative infinity, \( F(x) \) approaches 0:\n     $$\n     \lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0\n     $$\n   - As \( x \) approaches positive infinity, \( F(x) \) approaches 1:\n     $$\n     \lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1\n     $$\n\n6. **Monotonicity**: The CDF is a non-decreasing function, meaning that if \( a < b \), then:\n   $$\n   F(a) \leq F(b)\n   $$\n\nThese properties ensure that the probability distribution function behaves in a mathematically consistent manner, allowing for the effective modeling of random variables in statistics and probability theory. Understanding these properties is crucial for applying statistical methods and conducting data analysis.
