answer: >-
    The product rule for logarithms states that the logarithm of a product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of those numbers. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\n\log_b(A \cdot B) = \log_b(A) + \log_b(B)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ \log_b $ denotes the logarithm with base $ b $,\n- $ A $ and $ B $ are positive real numbers.\n\n### Example of Application\n\nLet's consider an example where we apply the product rule. Suppose we want to calculate \( \log_2(20) \). We can express 20 as the product of 5 and 4:\n\n$$\n20 = 5 \cdot 4\n$$\n\nUsing the product rule, we can write:\n\n$$\n\log_2(20) = \log_2(5 \cdot 4) = \log_2(5) + \log_2(4)\n$$\n\nNow, if we know the values of \( \log_2(5) \) and \( \log_2(4) \), we can compute \( \log_2(20) \). Since \( \log_2(4) = 2 \) (because $ 4 = 2^2 $), we can substitute this value:\n\n$$\n\log_2(20) = \log_2(5) + 2\n$$\n\nThis example illustrates how the product rule can simplify the calculation of logarithms by breaking down a product into a sum of logarithms. This property is particularly useful in algebraic manipulations and solving logarithmic equations.
