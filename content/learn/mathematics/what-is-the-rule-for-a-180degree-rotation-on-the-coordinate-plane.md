    What is the rule for a 180-degree rotation on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    The rule for a 180-degree rotation on the coordinate plane is straightforward. When a point \( (x, y) \) is rotated 180 degrees about the origin, the new coordinates of the point become \( (-x, -y) \). \n\nThis transformation can be visualized as follows:\n\n1. **Original Point**: \( (x, y) \)\n2. **After 180-degree Rotation**: \( (-x, -y) \)\n\nThis means that the point is reflected through the origin, effectively moving it to the opposite quadrant on the coordinate plane. \n\nFor example:\n- If the original point is \( (3, 4) \), after a 180-degree rotation, the new point will be \( (-3, -4) \).\n- If the original point is \( (-2, 5) \), after rotation, it will become \( (2, -5) \).\n\nThis rule applies to all points in the coordinate plane, regardless of their initial position. \n\nIn summary, the transformation rule for a 180-degree rotation about the origin is:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n$$\n\nThis transformation is consistent whether the rotation is described as clockwise or counterclockwise, as both result in the same final coordinates.
