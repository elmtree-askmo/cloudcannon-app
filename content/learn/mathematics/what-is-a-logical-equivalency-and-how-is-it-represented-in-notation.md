    What is a logical equivalency and how is it represented in notation?
answer: >-
    A logical equivalency is a fundamental concept in propositional logic that describes a relationship between two propositions. Specifically, two propositions $ P $ and $ Q $ are said to be logically equivalent if they yield the same truth values in all possible scenarios. This means that the statement $ P \equiv Q $ is a tautology, which is a compound proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of its individual components.\n\nIn formal notation, logical equivalency is represented as:\n\n$$\nP \equiv Q\n$$\n\nAlternatively, it can also be denoted using the symbol $ \equiv $ or $ \Leftrightarrow $, indicating that $ P $ and $ Q $ are interchangeable in logical contexts. \n\nTo determine if two propositions are logically equivalent, one common method is to construct a truth table. A truth table lists all possible combinations of truth values for the propositions and shows the resulting truth values for the compound statements. If the truth values for $ P $ and $ Q $ match in every possible case, then $ P $ and $ Q $ are logically equivalent.\n\nFor example, consider the equivalency:\n\n$$\n\neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q\n$$\n\nThis is an application of De Morgan's Laws, which states that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.\n\nIn summary, logical equivalency is a crucial aspect of propositional logic that allows for the simplification and transformation of logical statements while preserving their truth values.
