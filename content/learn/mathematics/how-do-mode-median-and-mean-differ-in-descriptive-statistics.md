    How do mode, median, and mean differ in descriptive statistics?
answer: >-
    In descriptive statistics, the mean, median, and mode are three fundamental measures of central tendency that summarize a set of data, but they differ in their definitions and implications.\n\n1. **Mean**: The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. It is represented mathematically as:\n   $$\n   \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n   $$\n   where $ x_i $ represents each value in the dataset and $ n $ is the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers; extreme values can significantly skew the mean, making it less representative of the dataset's central tendency in such cases.\n\n2. **Median**: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle number. If it has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The median is particularly useful in skewed distributions, as it is not affected by outliers. It can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   \text{Median} = \n   \begin{cases} \n   x_{(n+1)/2} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ \n   \frac{x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2 + 1)}}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n\n3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if no number repeats. The mode is useful for categorical data where we wish to know which is the most common category. It is defined simply as:\n   $$\n   \text{Mode} = \text{most frequently occurring value}\n   $$\n\nIn summary, while the mean provides a mathematical average, the median offers a middle point that is robust against outliers, and the mode identifies the most common value in the dataset. Each measure provides different insights, and the choice of which to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific analysis goals.
