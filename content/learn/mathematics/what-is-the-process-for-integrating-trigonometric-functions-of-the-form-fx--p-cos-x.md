    What is the process for integrating trigonometric functions of the form f(x) = p cos x?
answer: >-
    To integrate trigonometric functions of the form \( f(x) = p \cos x \), where $ p $ is a constant, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Integral**: The integral you want to compute is:\n   $$\n   \int p \cos x \, dx\n   $$\n\n2. **Factor Out the Constant**: Since $ p $ is a constant, you can factor it out of the integral:\n   $$\n   p \int \cos x \, dx\n   $$\n\n3. **Integrate the Cosine Function**: The integral of $ \cos x $ is a standard integral:\n   $$\n   \int \cos x \, dx = \sin x + C\n   $$\n   where $ C $ is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Substitute back into the equation:\n   $$\n   p \int \cos x \, dx = p (\sin x + C) = p \sin x + C\n   $$\n\nThus, the final result for the integral of \( f(x) = p \cos x \) is:\n$$\n\int p \cos x \, dx = p \sin x + C\n$$\n\nThis process can be applied similarly for \( f(x) = p \sin x \), where the integral would yield:\n$$\n\int p \sin x \, dx = -p \cos x + C\n$$\n\nIn summary, integrating trigonometric functions like $ p \cos x $ involves recognizing the standard integral of cosine, factoring out constants, and applying the constant of integration.
