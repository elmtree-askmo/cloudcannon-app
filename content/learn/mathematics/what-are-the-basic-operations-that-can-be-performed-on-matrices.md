    What are the basic operations that can be performed on matrices?
answer: >-
    The basic operations that can be performed on matrices include:\n\n1. **Addition**: Two matrices can be added together if they are of the same size (i.e., they have the same number of rows and columns). The addition is performed element-wise. For example, if $ A $ and $ B $ are two matrices of the same order, their sum $ C $ is given by:\n   $$\n   C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}\n   $$\n\n2. **Subtraction**: Similar to addition, two matrices can be subtracted if they are of the same size. The subtraction is also performed element-wise. For matrices $ A $ and $ B $:\n   $$\n   C_{ij} = A_{ij} - B_{ij}\n   $$\n\n3. **Multiplication**: Matrix multiplication is more complex than addition and subtraction. Two matrices $ A $ (of size $ m \times n $) and $ B $ (of size $ n \times p $) can be multiplied to produce a new matrix $ C $ (of size $ m \times p $). The element $ C_{ij} $ is calculated as:\n   $$\n   C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} B_{kj}\n   $$\n\n4. **Transpose**: The transpose of a matrix $ A $, denoted as $ A^T $, is formed by flipping the matrix over its diagonal, turning rows into columns and vice versa. For a matrix $ A $ of size $ m \times n $, the transpose $ A^T $ will be of size $ n \times m $.\n\n5. **Inverse**: The inverse of a matrix $ A $, denoted as $ A^{-1} $, exists only for square matrices (matrices with the same number of rows and columns) that are non-singular (i.e., their determinant is not zero). The inverse satisfies the property:\n   $$\n   A A^{-1} = I\n   $$\n   where $ I $ is the identity matrix.\n\n6. **Determinant**: The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix and provides important properties about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible.\n\nThese operations are fundamental in linear algebra and have numerous applications in various fields, including statistics, physics, and engineering.
