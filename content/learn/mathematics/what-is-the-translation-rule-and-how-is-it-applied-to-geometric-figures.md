answer: >-
    The translation rule in geometry refers to the process of moving a geometric figure from one position to another without altering its size, shape, or orientation. This transformation is characterized by a specific vector that indicates the direction and distance of the movement.\n\n### Translation Rule\n\nThe translation of a point or a geometric figure can be expressed mathematically. If you have a point \( (x, y) \) and you want to translate it by a vector \( (a, b) \), the new coordinates \( (x', y') \) after translation can be calculated using the following rule:\n\n$$\n(x', y') = (x + a, y + b)\n$$\n\nHere, $ a $ represents the horizontal shift (positive for right, negative for left), and $ b $ represents the vertical shift (positive for up, negative for down).\n\n### Application to Geometric Figures\n\nWhen applying the translation rule to geometric figures, each vertex of the figure is moved according to the same translation vector. For example, consider a triangle with vertices at \( A(x_1, y_1) \), \( B(x_2, y_2) \), and \( C(x_3, y_3) \). If we want to translate this triangle by the vector \( (a, b) \), the new vertices $ A', B', C' $ will be:\n\n$$\nA'(x_1', y_1') = (x_1 + a, y_1 + b) \\\nB'(x_2', y_2') = (x_2 + a, y_2 + b) \\\nC'(x_3', y_3') = (x_3 + a, y_3 + b)\n$$\n\n### Properties of Translation\n\n1. **Preservation of Shape and Size**: The translated figure remains congruent to the original figure, meaning that the size and shape do not change.\n2. **Direction and Distance**: The translation is defined by the vector, which specifies how far and in which direction the figure is moved.\n3. **Parallelism**: If two lines are parallel before translation, they remain parallel after translation.\n\n### Example\n\nIf we have a square with vertices at \( (1, 1) \), \( (1, 3) \), \( (3, 3) \), and \( (3, 1) \), and we want to translate it by the vector \( (2, -1) \), the new vertices will be:\n\n- \( (1 + 2, 1 - 1) = (3, 0) \)\n- \( (1 + 2, 3 - 1) = (3, 2) \)\n- \( (3 + 2, 3 - 1) = (5, 2) \)\n- \( (3 + 2, 1 - 1) = (5, 0) \)\n\nThus, the new square will have vertices at \( (3, 0) \), \( (3, 2) \), \( (5, 2) \), and \( (5, 0) \).\n\nIn summary, the translation rule is a fundamental concept in geometry that allows for the movement of figures in a plane while maintaining their properties.
