    How is an indefinite integral different from a definite integral in terms of its result?
answer: >-
    The difference between indefinite and definite integrals primarily lies in their results and the presence of limits of integration.\n\n1. **Indefinite Integral**: An indefinite integral, also known as an antiderivative, does not have specified upper and lower limits. The result of an indefinite integral is a family of functions that represent the general form of the antiderivative of a given function. This result includes a constant of integration, typically denoted as \( C \). For example, the indefinite integral of a function \( f(x) \) is expressed as:\n   $$\n   \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C\n   $$\n   where \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \).\n\n2. **Definite Integral**: In contrast, a definite integral has specified upper and lower limits of integration. The result of a definite integral is a specific numerical value that represents the area under the curve of the function \( f(x) \) between the two limits. It is expressed as:\n   $$\n   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n   $$\n   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lower and upper limits, respectively, and \( F(x) \) is the antiderivative of \( f(x) \).\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- **Indefinite integrals** yield a function (plus a constant), while **definite integrals** yield a specific numerical value representing the area under the curve between two points.
