    How do transformations affect the positions of vertices in a geometric figure?
answer: >-
    Transformations in geometry significantly affect the positions of vertices in a geometric figure. There are several types of transformations, each with distinct effects on the vertices:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation involves sliding a figure in a straight line from one position to another without changing its shape, size, or orientation. Each vertex of the figure moves the same distance in the same direction. For example, if a triangle with vertices at \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), and \(C(5, 6)\) is translated 2 units to the right and 3 units up, the new vertices will be \(A'(3, 5)\), \(B'(5, 7)\), and \(C'(7, 9)\).\n\n2. **Reflection**: This transformation flips a figure over a line (the line of reflection), creating a mirror image. The positions of the vertices change based on their distances from the line of reflection. For instance, if a triangle is reflected over the y-axis, the x-coordinates of its vertices will change sign. If the original vertices are \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), and \(C(5, 6)\), the reflected vertices will be \(A'(-1, 2)\), \(B'(-3, 4)\), and \(C'(-5, 6)\).\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation turns a figure around a fixed point known as the center of rotation. The vertices' positions change based on the angle of rotation. For example, if a triangle is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the origin, the vertex \(A(1, 0)\) would move to \(A'(0, 1)\), \(B(0, 1)\) would move to \(B'(-1, 0)\), and \(C(1, 1)\) would move to \(C'(-1, 1)\).\n\n4. **Dilation**: This transformation alters the size of a figure while maintaining its shape. The vertices move away from or towards a center point (the center of dilation) based on a scale factor. For example, if a triangle with vertices \(A(1, 2)\), \(B(3, 4)\), and \(C(5, 6)\) is dilated from the origin by a scale factor of 2, the new vertices will be \(A'(2, 4)\), \(B'(6, 8)\), and \(C'(10, 12)\).\n\n5. **Shear**: This transformation slants the shape of an object. The vertices shift in a direction parallel to a given axis, which can distort the figure. For example, if a triangle is sheared horizontally, the y-coordinates of the vertices may remain the same while the x-coordinates change based on the shear factor.\n\nIn summary, transformations such as translation, reflection, rotation, dilation, and shear directly affect the positions of vertices in geometric figures by altering their coordinates according to specific rules. Understanding these transformations is crucial in various fields, including geometry, physics, and computer graphics, as they help model and analyze the movement and alteration of shapes in space.
