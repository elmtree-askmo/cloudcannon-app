    What is the definition of sample space in probability theory?
answer: >-
    In probability theory, the sample space is defined as the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment or trial. It is also referred to as the sample description space, possibility space, or outcome space. The sample space is typically denoted using set notation, where the individual outcomes, known as sample points, are listed as elements within the set.\n\nFor example, when rolling a single six-sided die, the sample space can be represented as:\n\n$$\nS = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that there are six possible outcomes when the die is rolled. Understanding the sample space is crucial for calculating probabilities, as it provides the total number of possible outcomes that can occur in a given experiment.\n\nIn many cases, while the outcomes in a sample space may not be equally likely, defining the sample space in a way that approximates equal likelihood can simplify the computation of probabilities for various events within that space. The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in a sample space must equal 1, reflecting the certainty that one of the outcomes will occur.\n\nOverall, the concept of sample space is foundational in probability theory and is essential for conducting probabilistic analyses across various applications, including games, statistics, risk management, and scientific experiments.
