answer: >-
    To convert milliliters (mL) to liters (L), you can follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Factor**: One liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters. Therefore, to convert from milliliters to liters, you will divide the number of milliliters by 1,000.\n\n2. **Use the Conversion Formula**: The formula for converting milliliters to liters is:\n   $$\n   L = \frac{mL}{1000}\n   $$\n   Alternatively, you can also express it as:\n   $$\n   L = mL \times 0.001\n   $$\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation**: Substitute the milliliter value into the formula and perform the calculation. For example, if you want to convert 125 mL to liters:\n   $$\n   L = \frac{125}{1000} = 0.125 \, L\n   $$\n\n4. **Example Calculation**: If you have 18 water bottles, each containing 500 mL, you would first calculate the total volume in milliliters:\n   $$\n   \text{Total mL} = 500 \, mL \times 18 = 9000 \, mL\n   $$\n   Then, convert to liters:\n   $$\n   L = \frac{9000}{1000} = 9 \, L\n   $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily convert any volume from milliliters to liters.
