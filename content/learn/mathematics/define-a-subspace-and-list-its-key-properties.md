    A subspace is a subset of a vector space that maintains the structure of a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication. It must contain the zero vector, be closed under vector addition, and be closed under scalar multiplication, essential for the consistency of linear algebra operations.

    Define a subspace and list its key properties.
answer: >-
    A **subspace** is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. For a subset to qualify as a subspace, it must satisfy three key properties:\n\n1. **Contains the Zero Vector**: The subspace must include the zero vector of the parent vector space. This is essential because the zero vector serves as the additive identity, ensuring that for any vector $ v $ in the subspace, the equation $ v + 0 = v $ holds true.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition**: If $ u $ and $ v $ are any two vectors in the subspace, then their sum $ u + v $ must also be in the subspace. This property ensures that the addition operation remains within the subset.\n\n3. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: If $ u $ is a vector in the subspace and $ c $ is any scalar, then the product $ cu $ must also be in the subspace. This property guarantees that scaling a vector in the subspace does not take it outside the subspace.\n\nThese properties are crucial for maintaining the structure of a vector space within the subset, allowing for consistent mathematical operations and the application of linear algebra concepts. Understanding subspaces is fundamental for exploring more complex topics in linear algebra, such as spanning sets, linear independence, and dimension.
