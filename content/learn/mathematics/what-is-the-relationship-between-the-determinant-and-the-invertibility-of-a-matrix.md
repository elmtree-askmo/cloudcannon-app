    What is the relationship between the determinant and the invertibility of a matrix?
answer: >-
    The relationship between the determinant of a matrix and its invertibility is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. Specifically, a square matrix $ A $ is invertible (or non-singular) if and only if its determinant is non-zero. This can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Determinant and Invertibility**: If the determinant of a matrix $ A $ is non-zero, i.e., \( \text{det}(A) \neq 0 \), then the matrix is invertible, meaning there exists a matrix $ A^{-1} $ such that $ A A^{-1} = I $, where $ I $ is the identity matrix. Conversely, if \( \text{det}(A) = 0 \), the matrix is singular and does not have an inverse.\n\n2. **Geometric Interpretation**: The determinant can be thought of as a measure of the "volume" of the parallelepiped formed by the column vectors of the matrix. A non-zero determinant indicates that the column vectors span an $ n $-dimensional space (for an $ n \times n $ matrix), while a zero determinant implies that the vectors are linearly dependent, thus failing to span the full space.\n\n3. **Eigenvalues and Invertibility**: Another perspective on this relationship involves eigenvalues. A matrix is invertible if none of its eigenvalues are zero. If an eigenvalue is zero, it indicates that the matrix is singular, reinforcing the connection between the determinant and invertibility.\n\n4. **Row Reduction and Determinants**: The process of row reduction can also be linked to the determinant. If during row reduction, a row of zeros is produced, the determinant becomes zero, indicating that the matrix is not invertible.\n\nIn summary, the determinant serves as a crucial indicator of a matrix's invertibility: a non-zero determinant confirms that the matrix is invertible, while a zero determinant indicates that it is singular and lacks an inverse.
