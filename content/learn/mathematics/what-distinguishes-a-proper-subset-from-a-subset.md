    What distinguishes a proper subset from a subset?
answer: >-
    A proper subset and a subset are related concepts in set theory, but they have distinct definitions:\n\n1. **Subset**: A set $ A $ is considered a subset of set $ B $ if every element of $ A $ is also an element of $ B $. This relationship is denoted as $ A \subseteq B $. Importantly, a set can be a subset of itself. For example, if $ A = \{1, 2\} $ and $ B = \{1, 2, 3\} $, then $ A \subseteq B $ is true, and also $ B \subseteq B $ is true.\n\n2. **Proper Subset**: A set $ A $ is a proper subset of set $ B $ if $ A $ is a subset of $ B $ and there exists at least one element in $ B $ that is not in $ A $. This is denoted as $ A \subset B $. Using the same example, since $ A = \{1, 2\} $ and $ B = \{1, 2, 3\} $, $ A $ is a proper subset of $ B $ because $ B $ contains the element $ 3 $, which is not in $ A $.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that a proper subset cannot be identical to the original set, while a subset can be. Thus, every proper subset is a subset, but not every subset is a proper subset.
