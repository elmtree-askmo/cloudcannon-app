    What is the process for simplifying radical expressions with common bases?
answer: >-
    To simplify radical expressions with common bases, you can follow a systematic process that utilizes the properties of exponents and radicals. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Identify the Radical Expression**: A radical expression typically has a radical symbol (√) and a radicand (the expression inside the radical). For example, consider the expression $ \sqrt{a^m \cdot b^n} $.\n\n2. **Use the Product Rule for Radicals**: The product rule states that:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{a \cdot b} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}\n   $$\n   This allows you to separate the radicand into simpler components.\n\n3. **Factor the Radicand**: Look for perfect squares (or cubes, depending on the index of the radical) within the radicand. For example, if you have $ \sqrt{36x^4} $, you can factor it as $ \sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{x^4} $.\n\n4. **Simplify Each Component**: Simplify the square roots (or cube roots) of the factors. For instance:\n   - $ \sqrt{36} = 6 $\n   - $ \sqrt{x^4} = x^2 $\n\n   Therefore, $ \sqrt{36x^4} = 6x^2 $.\n\n5. **Combine Like Terms**: If there are any like terms or common bases, combine them. For example, if you have $ \sqrt{a^m} $, you can simplify it to $ a^{m/2} $.\n\n6. **Apply the Quotient Rule if Necessary**: If your expression involves division, use the quotient rule:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}\n   $$\n   This can help in simplifying expressions where the radical is in the denominator.\n\n7. **Check for Further Simplification**: After simplifying, check if any further simplification is possible. This may involve factoring out additional perfect squares or cubes.\n\n### Example\nLet’s simplify the expression $ \sqrt{50x^6y^2} $:\n\n1. Factor the radicand: $ 50 = 25 \cdot 2 $ and \( x^6 = (x^3)^2 \) and \( y^2 = (y)^2 \).\n2. Apply the product rule:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{50x^6y^2} = \sqrt{25} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{x^6} \cdot \sqrt{y^2}\n   $$\n3. Simplify each component:\n   - $ \sqrt{25} = 5 $\n   - $ \sqrt{x^6} = x^3 $\n   - $ \sqrt{y^2} = y $\n4. Combine the results:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{50x^6y^2} = 5x^3y\sqrt{2}\n   $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively simplify radical expressions with common bases.
