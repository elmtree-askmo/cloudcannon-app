    What are the conditions for a matrix to be diagonalizable?
answer: >-
    A matrix is diagonalizable if it satisfies certain conditions related to its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Here are the key criteria for a matrix $ A $ to be diagonalizable:\n\n1. **Existence of Linearly Independent Eigenvectors**: A matrix $ A $ is diagonalizable if it has enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis for the vector space. Specifically, for an $ n \times n $ matrix, there must be $ n $ linearly independent eigenvectors. This means that the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue must equal its algebraic multiplicity.\n\n2. **Distinct Eigenvalues**: If the characteristic polynomial of the matrix has $ n $ distinct roots (eigenvalues), then the matrix is guaranteed to be diagonalizable. Each distinct eigenvalue corresponds to a unique eigenvector, ensuring a complete basis.\n\n3. **Algebraic and Geometric Multiplicity**: For eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than one, the matrix is diagonalizable if the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue (geometric multiplicity) equals its multiplicity in the characteristic polynomial (algebraic multiplicity).\n\nIn summary, a matrix is diagonalizable if it has $ n $ linearly independent eigenvectors, or if it has distinct eigenvalues, or if the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue matches its algebraic multiplicity.
