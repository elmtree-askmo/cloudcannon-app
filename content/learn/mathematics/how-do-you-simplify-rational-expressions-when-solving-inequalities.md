answer: >-
    To simplify rational expressions when solving inequalities, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the Rational Expression**: Start by moving all terms to one side of the inequality, ensuring that the rational expression is on one side and zero is on the other. For example, if you have an inequality like $\frac{12}{x} \leq -4$, you would rearrange it to $\frac{12}{x} + 4 \leq 0$.\n\n2. **Combine into a Single Fraction**: If necessary, combine the terms into a single rational expression. This often involves finding a common denominator. For instance, in the previous example, you would rewrite it as:\n   $$\n   \frac{12 + 4x}{x} \leq 0\n   $$\n\n3. **Factor the Expression**: Factor both the numerator and the denominator completely. This helps in identifying critical points (where the expression is zero or undefined). For example, if you have $\frac{12 + 4x}{x}$, you can factor the numerator to get:\n   $$\n   \frac{4(3 + x)}{x} \leq 0\n   $$\n\n4. **Identify Critical Points**: Determine the values of $x$ that make the numerator zero (the roots) and the values that make the denominator zero (undefined points). In our example, the critical points would be $x = -3$ (from the numerator) and $x = 0$ (from the denominator).\n\n5. **Test Intervals**: Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals. Choose test points from each interval to determine the sign of the rational expression in that interval. For example, if your critical points are $-3$ and $0$, you would test intervals like $(-\infty, -3)$, $(-3, 0)$, and $(0, \infty)$.\n\n6. **Check Signs**: Substitute the test points back into the simplified rational expression to check whether the expression is positive or negative in each interval. This will help you determine where the inequality holds true.\n\n7. **Write the Solution**: Finally, based on the signs from the test points, write the solution in interval notation, considering whether the inequality is strict (e.g., $<$ or $>$) or inclusive (e.g., $\leq$ or $\geq$).\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively simplify and solve rational inequalities.
