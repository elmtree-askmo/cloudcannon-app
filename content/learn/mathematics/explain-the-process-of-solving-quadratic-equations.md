    To solve quadratic equations, there are several methods available, each suitable for different types of equations. A quadratic equation is typically expressed in the standard form:\n\n$$\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$. Here are the primary methods for solving quadratic equations:\n\n### 1. Factoring\nThis method involves expressing the quadratic equation as a product of two binomials. The steps are as follows:\n\n- **Step 1:** Ensure the equation is in standard form.\n- **Step 2:** Factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the equation.\n- **Step 3:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$.\n\n**Example:**\nSolve $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$.\n\n1. Factor: \((x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\)\n2. Set each factor to zero: \n   - $x - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 2$\n   - $x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$\n\nThus, the solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.\n\n### 2. Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula can be used for any quadratic equation and is given by:\n\n$$\nx = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}\n$$\n\n**Steps:**\n- Identify $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the equation.\n- Substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n- Calculate the discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$) to determine the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n**Example:**\nSolve $2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$.\n\n1. Identify $a = 2$, $b = -4$, $c = -6$.\n2. Calculate the discriminant: \n   - \(b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6) = 16 + 48 = 64\)\n3. Apply the quadratic formula:\n   - $x = \frac{{4 \pm \sqrt{64}}}{{4}} = \frac{{4 \pm 8}}{{4}}$\n   - Solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.\n\n### 3. Completing the Square\nThis method involves rearranging the equation into a perfect square trinomial.\n\n**Steps:**\n- Move the constant term to the other side of the equation.\n- Divide all terms by $a$ (if $a \neq 1$).\n- Add \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) to both sides to complete the square.\n- Factor the left side and solve for $x$.\n\n**Example:**\nSolve $x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0$.\n\n1. Rearrange: $x^2 - 6x = -5$\n2. Complete the square: \n   - Add \((\frac{-6}{2})^2 = 9\) to both sides: \n   - $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 4$\n3. Factor: \((x - 3)^2 = 4\)\n4. Solve: \n   - $x - 3 = \pm 2$\n   - Solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = 1$.\n\n### 4. Graphing\nGraphing the quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ can also provide the solutions. The points where the graph intersects the x-axis represent the roots of the equation.\n\n### Summary\nEach method has its advantages depending on the specific quadratic equation being solved. Factoring is often the quickest if the equation is easily factorable, while the quadratic formula is universally applicable. Completing the square is useful for deriving the vertex form of a quadratic function, and graphing provides a visual representation of the solutions.
