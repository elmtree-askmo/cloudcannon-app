    Define negation and provide its truth table.
answer: >-
    Negation is a fundamental logical operation that reverses the truth value of a proposition. The negation of a proposition $ P $ is denoted as $ \neg P $. This means:\n\n- If $ P $ is true, then $ \neg P $ is false.\n- If $ P $ is false, then $ \neg P $ is true.\n\nNegation is a unary operator, meaning it operates on a single truth value. It allows for the expression of the opposite of a given statement, which is essential in logical reasoning.\n\nHere is the truth table for negation:\n\n| $ P $ | $ \neg P $ |\n|---------|--------------|\n| True    | False        |\n| False   | True         |\n\nFor example, if $ P $ represents the statement "It is raining," then:\n\n- If $ P $ is true (it is indeed raining), $ \neg P $ would be "It is not raining," which is false.\n- If $ P $ is false (it is not raining), $ \neg P $ would be true (it is indeed not raining).\n\nNegation is crucial in propositional logic as it enables more complex logical reasoning and the formulation of logical arguments.
