    A correct application of the inductive step can be illustrated through the proof that the sum of the first $ n $ odd integers is equal to $ n^2 $. \n\n### Statement to Prove\nWe want to prove that for all natural numbers $ n $, the sum of the first $ n $ odd integers is $ n^2 $. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1) = n^2\n$$\n\n### Step 1: Base Case\nFirst, we verify the base case when $ n = 1 $:\n$$\n1 = 1^2\n$$\nThis is true, so the base case holds.\n\n### Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis\nNext, we assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number $ k $. That is, we assume:\n$$\n1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2\n$$\nThis assumption is known as the **induction hypothesis**.\n\n### Step 3: Inductive Step\nNow, we need to show that if the statement holds for $ k $, it must also hold for $ k + 1 $. We need to prove:\n$$\n1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2\n$$\n\nUsing our induction hypothesis, we can rewrite the left-hand side:\n$$\nk^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1\n$$\n\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$\nk^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nSince we have shown that:\n$$\n1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2\n$$\nis true, we conclude that the inductive step holds.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, we conclude that the sum of the first $ n $ odd integers is $ n^2 $ for all natural numbers $ n $. This example effectively demonstrates the correct application of the inductive step in a proof by induction.
