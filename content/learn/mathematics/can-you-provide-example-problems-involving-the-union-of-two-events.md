    Here are some example problems involving the union of two events, illustrating both mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive scenarios:\n\n### Example 1: Mutually Exclusive Events\n**Problem:** In a class of 30 students, 15 students play basketball and 10 students play soccer. If no student plays both sports, what is the probability that a randomly selected student plays either basketball or soccer?\n\n**Solution:**\nLet $ A $ be the event that a student plays basketball, and $ B $ be the event that a student plays soccer. Since the events are mutually exclusive, we can use the formula for the union of two events:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n$$\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n- \( P(A) = \frac{15}{30} = 0.5 \)\n- \( P(B) = \frac{10}{30} = \frac{1}{3} \)\n\nNow, substituting into the formula:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected student plays either basketball or soccer is $ \frac{5}{6} $.\n\n### Example 2: Non-Mutually Exclusive Events\n**Problem:** In a survey of 100 people, 40 like coffee, 30 like tea, and 10 like both coffee and tea. What is the probability that a randomly selected person likes either coffee or tea?\n\n**Solution:**\nLet $ A $ be the event that a person likes coffee, and $ B $ be the event that a person likes tea. Since these events are not mutually exclusive, we use the formula:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\n$$\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n- \( P(A) = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \)\n- \( P(B) = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3 \)\n- \( P(A \cap B) = \frac{10}{100} = 0.1 \)\n\nNow, substituting into the formula:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.6\n$$\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected person likes either coffee or tea is $ 0.6 $.\n\n### Summary\nThese examples illustrate how to calculate the probability of the union of two events, both in cases where the events are mutually exclusive and where they are not. The key takeaway is to remember to subtract the intersection when the events can occur simultaneously.
