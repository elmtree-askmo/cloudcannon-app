    What is the definition of a function in terms of one-to-one mapping and multiple inputs with a single output?
answer: >-
    A function is defined as a specific type of relation where each input (often referred to as the independent variable, denoted as $ x $) corresponds to exactly one output (the dependent variable, denoted as $ y $). This means that for every value of $ x $ in the domain of the function, there is a unique value of $ y $ in the range.\n\nIn terms of one-to-one mapping, a function can have multiple inputs that yield the same output, but it cannot have a single input that produces multiple outputs. For example, in the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), both \( f(2) \) and \( f(-2) \) yield the same output of 4, demonstrating that different inputs can map to the same output. However, if we were to input a single value, such as \( f(2) \), it will always return 4, ensuring that each input has a unique output.\n\nTo summarize, a function is characterized by the following properties:\n- Each input corresponds to exactly one output.\n- Multiple inputs can map to the same output.\n- A single input cannot map to multiple outputs.\n\nThis definition is crucial in understanding the behavior of functions and their graphical representations, as well as in identifying whether a given relation qualifies as a function.
