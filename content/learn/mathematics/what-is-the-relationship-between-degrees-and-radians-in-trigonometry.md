    What is the relationship between degrees and radians in trigonometry?
answer: >-
    In trigonometry, the relationship between degrees and radians is fundamental for measuring angles. Both degrees and radians are units used to express angles, but they do so in different ways.\n\n1. **Definition of Radians**: A radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. This means that if you have a circle of radius $ r $, an angle of $ \theta $ radians corresponds to an arc length $ s $ given by the formula:\n   $$\n   s = r \theta\n   $$\n\n2. **Full Rotation**: One complete rotation around a circle corresponds to $ 360^\circ $ in degrees and $ 2\pi $ radians. Therefore, we can establish the relationship:\n   $$\n   360^\circ = 2\pi \text{ radians}\n   $$\n\n3. **Conversion Formulas**:\n   - To convert degrees to radians, you can use the formula:\n     $$\n     \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}\n     $$\n   - Conversely, to convert radians to degrees, the formula is:\n     $$\n     \text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}\n     $$\n\n4. **Common Angles**: Some common angles and their conversions are:\n   - $ 0^\circ = 0 $ radians\n   - $ 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians\n   - $ 180^\circ = \pi $ radians\n   - $ 270^\circ = \frac{3\pi}{2} $ radians\n   - $ 360^\circ = 2\pi $ radians\n\n5. **Approximate Value**: One radian is approximately equal to $ 57.3^\circ $.\n\nUnderstanding this relationship is crucial for working with trigonometric functions, as many mathematical applications prefer radians due to their direct connection to the unit circle, making calculations more straightforward in calculus and physics.
