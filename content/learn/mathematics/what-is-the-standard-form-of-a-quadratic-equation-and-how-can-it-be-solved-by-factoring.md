    What is the standard form of a quadratic equation, and how can it be solved by factoring?
answer: >-
    The standard form of a quadratic equation is given by:\n\n$$\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \neq 0$. This form is essential for identifying the coefficients needed for various methods of solving the equation, including factoring.\n\nTo solve a quadratic equation by factoring, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the equation in standard form**: Ensure that the equation is set to zero, with all terms on one side. For example, if you have $2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 0$, it is already in standard form.\n\n2. **Factor the quadratic expression**: Look for two numbers that multiply to $ac$ (the product of $a$ and $c$) and add to $b$. For instance, in the equation $2x^2 + 7x + 3$, you need to find two numbers that multiply to $2 \times 3 = 6$ and add to $7$. The numbers $6$ and $1$ work because $6 \times 1 = 6$ and $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\n3. **Rewrite the middle term**: Use the numbers found to split the middle term. The equation becomes:\n   $$\n   2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3 = 0\n   $$\n\n4. **Factor by grouping**: Group the terms into pairs and factor out the common factors:\n   $$\n   2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3) = 0\n   $$\n   This can be factored further as:\n   $$\n   (2x + 1)(x + 3) = 0\n   $$\n\n5. **Use the Zero Product Property**: Set each factor equal to zero:\n   - $2x + 1 = 0$ leads to $x = -\frac{1}{2}$\n   - $x + 3 = 0$ leads to $x = -3$\n\n6. **Check your solutions**: Substitute the values back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThus, the solutions to the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 0$ are $x = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $x = -3$.\n\nThis method of solving quadratic equations by factoring is effective when the quadratic can be factored easily. If the quadratic does not factor neatly, other methods such as completing the square or using the quadratic formula may be necessary.
