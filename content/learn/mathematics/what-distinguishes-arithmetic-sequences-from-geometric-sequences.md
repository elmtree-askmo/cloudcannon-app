    What distinguishes arithmetic sequences from geometric sequences?
answer: >-
    Arithmetic sequences and geometric sequences are two fundamental types of mathematical sequences, each characterized by distinct methods of progression.\n\n### Arithmetic Sequences\nAn arithmetic sequence is defined by a constant difference between consecutive terms. This means that each term is obtained by adding a fixed value, known as the common difference ($d$), to the previous term. The general form of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots\}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $a$ is the first term,\n- $d$ is the common difference.\n\nFor example, the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference $d = 2$.\n\n### Geometric Sequences\nIn contrast, a geometric sequence is characterized by a constant ratio between consecutive terms. Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed value, known as the common ratio ($r$). The general form of a geometric sequence can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\{a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots\}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $a$ is the first term,\n- $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nFor example, the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 is a geometric sequence where the common ratio $r = 2$.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Method of Progression**:\n   - **Arithmetic Sequence**: Progresses by addition (constant difference).\n   - **Geometric Sequence**: Progresses by multiplication (constant ratio).\n\n2. **Growth Pattern**:\n   - **Arithmetic Sequence**: Linear growth; the terms increase by a fixed amount.\n   - **Geometric Sequence**: Exponential growth; the terms increase by a fixed factor, leading to rapid growth.\n\n3. **Formulas**:\n   - The $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n     $$\n     a_n = a + (n-1)d\n     $$\n   - The $n$-th term of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n     $$\n     a_n = ar^{n-1}\n     $$\n\nIn summary, the primary distinction between arithmetic and geometric sequences lies in how the terms are generated: arithmetic sequences rely on a constant addition, while geometric sequences depend on a constant multiplication. This fundamental difference leads to varying growth patterns and applications in mathematics.
