    An example of multiplying two decimal numbers is as follows:\n\nLet's multiply $0.8$ and $0.4$.\n\n1. **Ignore the decimal points** and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers:\n   $$ \n   8 \times 4 = 32 \n   $$\n\n2. **Count the total number of decimal places** in both original numbers. In this case, $0.8$ has 1 decimal place and $0.4$ also has 1 decimal place, giving us a total of 2 decimal places.\n\n3. **Place the decimal point** in the product. Since we have 2 decimal places, we place the decimal point two places from the right in the product:\n   $$ \n   32 \rightarrow 0.32 \n   $$\n\nThus, the product of $0.8$ and $0.4$ is $0.32$. \n\nThis method of multiplying decimals ensures that the final answer reflects the correct placement of the decimal point based on the original numbers.
