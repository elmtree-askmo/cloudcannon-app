    Define parallel vectors and explain how scalar multiples relate to their properties.
answer: >-
    Parallel vectors are defined as two vectors that have the same direction or are scalar multiples of each other. This means that if vector $ \vec{u} $ is parallel to vector $ \vec{v} $, there exists a scalar $ k $ such that:\n\n$$\n\vec{u} = k \cdot \vec{v}\n$$\n\nFor example, if \( \vec{u} = (2, 4) \) and \( \vec{v} = (1, 2) \), then $ \vec{u} $ is parallel to $ \vec{v} $ because $ \vec{u} = 2 \cdot \vec{v} $. \n\nThe relationship between parallel vectors and scalar multiples is crucial. When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, its magnitude changes, but its direction remains the same if the scalar is positive. If the scalar is negative, the direction of the vector is reversed. This property allows us to visualize parallel vectors as arrows that either point in the same direction or in opposite directions, but they will never intersect.\n\nIn practical terms, parallel vectors behave similarly to numbers on a number line. When adding vectors that are parallel and point in the same direction, their magnitudes can be summed. Conversely, if they point in opposite directions, their magnitudes can be subtracted. This behavior is fundamental in vector addition and is essential in various applications, including physics and engineering, where understanding the direction and magnitude of forces is critical. \n\nIn summary, the concept of scalar multiples is integral to the definition of parallel vectors, as it directly relates to their properties of direction and magnitude.
