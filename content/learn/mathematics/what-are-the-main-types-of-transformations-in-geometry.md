    What are the main types of transformations in geometry?
answer: >-
    In geometry, transformations are operations that alter the position, size, or orientation of geometric figures. The main types of transformations include:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation moves every point of a figure a certain distance in a specified direction without changing its shape or orientation. For example, sliding a book across a table represents a translation.\n\n2. **Reflection**: In this transformation, a figure is flipped over a line (the line of reflection), creating a mirror image. For instance, reflecting a point across the x-axis changes the sign of its y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate the same.\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation involves turning a figure around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a certain angle. For example, rotating a triangle 90 degrees around a point will change its orientation while maintaining its shape and size.\n\n4. **Dilation**: Dilation changes the size of a figure while maintaining its shape. The figure can be enlarged or reduced based on a scale factor. For instance, if a triangle is dilated by a factor of 2, each point of the triangle moves away from the center of dilation, resulting in a larger triangle.\n\n5. **Shear**: In a shear transformation, the shape of the figure is distorted, such that the transformation shifts one part of the figure in a specific direction while keeping the other part fixed. This can create a slanted effect.\n\nThese transformations can be combined to create more complex movements and are fundamental in understanding geometric relationships and properties. Each transformation can be represented algebraically using coordinates on the coordinate plane, allowing for precise calculations and visualizations.
