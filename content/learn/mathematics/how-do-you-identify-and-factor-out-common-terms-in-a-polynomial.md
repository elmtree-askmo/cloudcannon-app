    How do you identify and factor out common terms in a polynomial?
answer: >-
    To identify and factor out common terms in a polynomial, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**:\n   - Examine each term of the polynomial to find the GCF. The GCF is the largest expression that divides each term without leaving a remainder. This could be a number, a variable, or a combination of both.\n   - For example, in the polynomial $6x^3 + 9x^2$, the GCF is $3x^2$.\n\n2. **Divide Each Term by the GCF**:\n   - Once you have identified the GCF, divide each term of the polynomial by this factor. This will simplify the polynomial and help you see the remaining structure more clearly.\n   - Continuing with the previous example, dividing each term by $3x^2$ gives:\n     $$\n     \frac{6x^3}{3x^2} + \frac{9x^2}{3x^2} = 2x + 3\n     $$\n\n3. **Express the Polynomial as a Product**:\n   - Rewrite the original polynomial as the product of the GCF and the simplified expression obtained from the division.\n   - Thus, the polynomial $6x^3 + 9x^2$ can be factored as:\n     $$\n     6x^3 + 9x^2 = 3x^2(2x + 3)\n     $$\n\n4. **Check for Further Factoring**:\n   - After factoring out the GCF, check if the remaining polynomial can be factored further. This may involve using other factoring techniques such as factoring by grouping, recognizing special products (like the difference of squares), or factoring trinomials.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - Consider the polynomial $4x^4 - 8x^3 + 12x^2$:\n     - The GCF is $4x^2$.\n     - Dividing each term by $4x^2$ gives:\n       $$\n       \frac{4x^4}{4x^2} - \frac{8x^3}{4x^2} + \frac{12x^2}{4x^2} = x^2 - 2x + 3\n       $$\n     - Therefore, the factored form is:\n       $$\n       4x^2(x^2 - 2x + 3)\n       $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively identify and factor out common terms in a polynomial, simplifying the expression and making it easier to work with.
