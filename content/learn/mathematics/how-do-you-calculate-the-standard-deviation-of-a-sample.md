    To calculate the standard deviation of a sample, you first need to compute the sample variance and then take the square root of that variance. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**: First, find the mean (average) of your sample data set $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $:\n   $$\n   \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n   $$\n   where $ n $ is the number of observations in the sample.\n\n2. **Calculate the Variance**: Next, compute the sample variance $ s^2 $ using the formula:\n   $$\n   s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2\n   $$\n   This formula uses $ n-1 $ (Bessel's correction) in the denominator to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance from a sample.\n\n3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**: Finally, take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation $ s $:\n   $$\n   s = \sqrt{s^2}\n   $$\n\n### Example Calculation\nSuppose you have the following sample data: 4, 8, 6, 5, 3.\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**:\n   $$\n   \bar{x} = \frac{4 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 3}{5} = \frac{26}{5} = 5.2\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate the Variance**:\n   $$\n   s^2 = \frac{1}{5-1} \left((4 - 5.2)^2 + (8 - 5.2)^2 + (6 - 5.2)^2 + (5 - 5.2)^2 + (3 - 5.2)^2\right)\n   $$\n   $$\n   = \frac{1}{4} \left((-1.2)^2 + (2.8)^2 + (0.8)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (-2.2)^2\right)\n   $$\n   $$\n   = \frac{1}{4} \left(1.44 + 7.84 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 4.84\right) = \frac{1}{4} \left(14.8\right) = 3.7\n   $$\n\n3. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**:\n   $$\n   s = \sqrt{3.7} \approx 1.92\n   $$\n\nThus, the standard deviation of the sample is approximately 1.92. This value indicates how much the data points deviate from the mean on average.
