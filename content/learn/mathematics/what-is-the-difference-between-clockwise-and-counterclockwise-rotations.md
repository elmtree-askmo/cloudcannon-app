    What is the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations?
answer: >-
    The difference between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations primarily lies in the direction of the rotation relative to the movement of a clock's hands.\n\n1. **Clockwise Rotation**: This type of rotation follows the same direction as the hands of a clock. When you visualize a clock, the movement starts from the top (12 o'clock), moves to the right (3 o'clock), then down (6 o'clock), and finally to the left (9 o'clock) before returning to the top. In mathematical terms, a clockwise rotation is often considered a negative rotation. For example, if a point \(A(x, y)\) is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin, its new coordinates will be \(A' (y, -x)\).\n\n2. **Counterclockwise Rotation**: In contrast, counterclockwise rotation moves in the opposite direction to the clock's hands. Starting again from the top (12 o'clock), the movement goes to the left (9 o'clock), then down (6 o'clock), to the right (3 o'clock), and back up to the top. This type of rotation is typically considered a positive rotation in mathematics. For instance, if a point \(A(x, y)\) is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin, its new coordinates will be \(A' (-y, x)\).\n\nIn summary, the key differences can be summarized as follows:\n- **Clockwise**: Direction of rotation is the same as the hands of a clock; often represented as negative in mathematical contexts.\n- **Counterclockwise**: Direction of rotation is opposite to the hands of a clock; often represented as positive in mathematical contexts.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial in geometry, particularly when dealing with transformations and rotations of geometric figures on the coordinate plane.
