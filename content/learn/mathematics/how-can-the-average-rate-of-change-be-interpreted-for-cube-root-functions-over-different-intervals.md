    How can the average rate of change be interpreted for cube root functions over different intervals?
answer: >-
    The average rate of change for cube root functions can be interpreted by examining how the function behaves over different intervals. The cube root function is defined as \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) and is characterized by its continuous increase across its entire domain, which includes all real numbers.\n\n### Average Rate of Change Calculation\nThe average rate of change of a function over an interval $[a, b]$ is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nFor example, if we calculate the average rate of change of the cube root function from $ x = 1 $ to $ x = 8 $:\n\n$$\n\frac{f(8) - f(1)}{8 - 1} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{8} - \sqrt[3]{1}}{8 - 1} = \frac{2 - 1}{7} = \frac{1}{7}\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the function increases, but at a decreasing rate as $ x $ increases.\n\n### Behavior Over Specific Intervals\n1. **Interval $[0, 1]$**:\n   - For both the cube root function and the square root function, the average rate of change is positive. However, the square root function has a higher average rate of change compared to the cube root function in this interval.\n\n2. **Interval $[1, 3]$**:\n   - Again, the square root function maintains a higher average rate of change than the cube root function. This trend continues as the square root function's slope decreases more rapidly than that of the cube root function.\n\n### General Observations\n- The cube root function is defined for all real numbers, while the square root function is only defined for non-negative values (domain: \([0, \infty)\)). This difference in domains means that there are intervals where the square root function cannot be evaluated, making direct comparisons impossible in those cases.\n- The range of the cube root function includes both positive and negative values, while the square root function only yields non-negative outputs.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the average rate of change for cube root functions can be calculated and interpreted over various intervals, it is essential to consider the differences in domain and behavior compared to other functions, such as the square root function. The cube root function increases steadily, but its rate of change decreases more gradually than that of the square root function, particularly in the intervals examined.
