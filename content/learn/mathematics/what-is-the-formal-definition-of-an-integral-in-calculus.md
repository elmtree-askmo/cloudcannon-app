    What is the formal definition of an integral in calculus?
answer: >-
    The formal definition of an integral in calculus can be understood through the concept of the definite integral. The definite integral of a function \( f(x) \) over the interval \([a, b]\) is denoted as:\n\n$$\n\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\n$$\n\nThis integral represents the signed area between the curve \( y = f(x) \) and the \( x \)-axis over the interval from \( a \) to \( b \). The integral is defined under the condition that \( a < b \), although it can also be interpreted when \( a > b \) by reversing the limits, which changes the sign of the integral.\n\nTo formally define the definite integral, we consider the limit of a Riemann sum. A Riemann sum approximates the area under the curve by dividing the interval \([a, b]\) into \( n \) subintervals of equal width \( \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \). The sum of the areas of rectangles formed by evaluating the function at specific points within these subintervals leads to the following definition:\n\n$$\n\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\n$$\n\nwhere \( x_i^* \) is a sample point in the \( i \)-th subinterval \([x_{i-1}, x_i]\).\n\nIn summary, the integral is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to calculate areas, volumes, and other quantities by summing infinitesimal pieces of a continuous function. The relationship between integrals and derivatives is encapsulated in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which connects these two core concepts of calculus.
