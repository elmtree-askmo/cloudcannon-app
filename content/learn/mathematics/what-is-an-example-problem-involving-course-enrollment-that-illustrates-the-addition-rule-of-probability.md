    An example problem involving course enrollment that illustrates the Addition Rule of Probability can be framed as follows:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nSuppose a university offers two elective courses: Course A and Course B. The probability that a student enrolls in Course A is \(P(A) = 0.4\), and the probability that a student enrolls in Course B is \(P(B) = 0.3\). Additionally, the probability that a student enrolls in both courses is \(P(A \cap B) = 0.1\). \n\nWe want to find the probability that a student enrolls in either Course A or Course B, which can be calculated using the Addition Rule of Probability.\n\n**Solution:**\nAccording to the General Addition Rule for Probability, the probability of the union of two events is given by:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n$$\nP(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\\nP(A \cup B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.1 \\\nP(A \cup B) = 0.6\n$$\n\nThus, the probability that a student enrolls in either Course A or Course B is $0.6$ or 60%. \n\nThis example effectively illustrates the Addition Rule of Probability by showing how to calculate the likelihood of a student enrolling in at least one of the two courses, taking into account the overlap of students who enroll in both courses.
