    How do you find inverse functions?
answer: >-
    To find the inverse of a function, you can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Start with the Function**: Begin with the function expressed in the form \( y = f(x) \). For example, if you have \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \), rewrite it as \( y = 3x + 2 \).\n\n2. **Swap Variables**: Interchange the roles of \( x \) and \( y \). This means you will replace \( y \) with \( x \) and \( x \) with \( y \). For our example, this gives you:\n   $$ x = 3y + 2 $$\n\n3. **Solve for \( y \)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( y \). Continuing with our example:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides:\n     $$ x - 2 = 3y $$\n   - Divide by 3:\n     $$ y = \frac{x - 2}{3} $$\n\n4. **Express the Inverse**: The inverse function is denoted as \( f^{-1}(x) \). Thus, from our example, we have:\n   $$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 2}{3} $$\n\n5. **Verify the Inverse**: To confirm that you have correctly found the inverse, you can check if \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \). For our example:\n   - Calculate \( f(f^{-1}(x)) \):\n     $$ f\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) = 3\left(\frac{x - 2}{3}\right) + 2 = x - 2 + 2 = x $$\n   - Calculate \( f^{-1}(f(x)) \):\n     $$ f^{-1}(3x + 2) = \frac{(3x + 2) - 2}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} = x $$\n\nBoth checks confirm that the inverse is correct.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- **One-to-One Functions**: For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (bijective), meaning that each output is produced by exactly one input. If a function is not one-to-one, it will not have a unique inverse.\n- **Graphical Representation**: The graph of the inverse function is a reflection of the original function across the line \( y = x \).\n\n### Example:\nLet's find the inverse of a more complex function, such as \( f(x) = \frac{4x + 1}{3x - 2} \):\n1. Start with \( y = \frac{4x + 1}{3x - 2} \).\n2. Swap \( x \) and \( y \):\n   $$ x = \frac{4y + 1}{3y - 2} $$\n3. Solve for \( y \):\n   - Multiply both sides by \( 3y - 2 \):\n     $$ x(3y - 2) = 4y + 1 $$\n   - Distribute:\n     $$ 3xy - 2x = 4y + 1 $$\n   - Rearrange to isolate \( y \):\n     $$ 3xy - 4y = 2x + 1 $$\n     $$ y(3x - 4) = 2x + 1 $$\n     $$ y = \frac{2x + 1}{3x - 4} $$\n4. Thus, the inverse function is:\n   $$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{3x - 4} $$\n\nBy following these steps, you can find the inverse of various types of functions, ensuring to check for one-to-one properties where necessary.
