answer: >-
    The section formula is a mathematical tool used to determine the coordinates of a point that divides a line segment into a specific ratio. This is particularly useful in coordinate geometry when you need to find a point that lies between two given points.\n\nIf a point $ P $ divides the line segment joining points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \) in the ratio $ m:n $, the coordinates of point $ P $ can be calculated using the section formula:\n\n$$\nP(x, y) = \left( \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} \right)\n$$\n\n### Example\nFor instance, consider point $ A $ at coordinates \( (2, 3) \) and point $ B $ at coordinates \( (4, 5) \). If point $ P $ divides the segment $ AB $ in the ratio $ 1:2 $, we can calculate the coordinates of point $ P $ as follows:\n\n1. Substitute the values into the section formula:\n   - $ m = 1 $\n   - $ n = 2 $\n   - $ x_1 = 2 $\n   - $ y_1 = 3 $\n   - $ x_2 = 4 $\n   - $ y_2 = 5 $\n\n2. Calculate the coordinates:\n   $$\n   P(x, y) = \left( \frac{1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 2}{1+2}, \frac{1 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 3}{1+2} \right) = \left( \frac{4 + 4}{3}, \frac{5 + 6}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{8}{3}, \frac{11}{3} \right)\n   $$\n\nThus, point $ P $ is located at \( \left( \frac{8}{3}, \frac{11}{3} \right) \).\n\n### Applications\nThe section formula is widely used in various fields such as computer graphics, engineering, and physics, where it is necessary to find points that divide segments in a specific ratio, whether for interpolation, modeling, or analysis.
