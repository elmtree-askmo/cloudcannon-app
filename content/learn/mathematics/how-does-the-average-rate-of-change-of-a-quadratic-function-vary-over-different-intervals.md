    How does the average rate of change of a quadratic function vary over different intervals?
answer: >-
    The average rate of change of a quadratic function varies significantly over different intervals due to the nature of quadratic functions, which are parabolic in shape. Unlike linear functions that have a constant rate of change (slope), quadratic functions exhibit a variable rate of change that can accelerate or decelerate depending on the interval chosen.\n\n### Definition of Average Rate of Change\nThe average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) over an interval $[a, b]$ is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nThis formula gives the slope of the secant line connecting the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\) on the graph of the function.\n\n### Behavior of Quadratic Functions\nFor a quadratic function of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) (where $ a \neq 0 $), the average rate of change will differ depending on the specific interval selected. This is because the slope of the secant line between two points on a parabola changes as you move along the curve.\n\n1. **Different Intervals**: For example, consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = -16x^2 + 96x \). If we calculate the average rate of change over the intervals $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 3]$:\n   - For the interval $[1, 2]$:\n     - \( f(1) = -16(1)^2 + 96(1) = 80 \)\n     - \( f(2) = -16(2)^2 + 96(2) = 128 \)\n     - Average Rate of Change = $ \frac{128 - 80}{2 - 1} = 48 $\n\n   - For the interval $[2, 3]$:\n     - \( f(2) = 128 \) (as calculated above)\n     - \( f(3) = -16(3)^2 + 96(3) = 144 \)\n     - Average Rate of Change = $ \frac{144 - 128}{3 - 2} = 16 $\n\n   As seen in this example, the average rate of change is different for the two intervals, indicating that the function is not changing at a constant rate.\n\n2. **Implications of Non-Constant Rate**: The varying average rates of change reflect the curvature of the quadratic function. As you move along the parabola, the slope of the tangent line (instantaneous rate of change) also changes, which can be analyzed using derivatives. The derivative of a quadratic function \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = 2ax + b\n$$\n\nThis derivative provides the instantaneous rate of change at any point $ x $ on the curve.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the average rate of change of a quadratic function varies over different intervals due to its non-linear nature. This variability is a key characteristic of quadratic functions, distinguishing them from linear functions, which maintain a constant rate of change. Understanding these differences is crucial for analyzing the behavior of quadratic functions and their applications in mathematical modeling.
