answer: >-
    To convert a quadratic equation from vertex form to standard form, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertex Form**: The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by:\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n   $$\n   where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Expand the Expression**: Start by expanding the squared term. This involves applying the formula \((x - h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2\):\n   $$\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\\n   = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k\n   $$\n\n3. **Distribute $a$**: Multiply $a$ through the expanded expression:\n   $$\n   y = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k\n   $$\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms**: Finally, combine the constant terms to write the equation in standard form:\n   $$\n   y = ax^2 + bx + c\n   $$\n   where $b = -2ah$ and $c = ah^2 + k$.\n\n### Example\nLet's say we have the vertex form:\n$$\ny = 2(x - 3)^2 + 4\n$$\n\n1. **Expand**:\n   $$\n   y = 2(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 4\n   $$\n\n2. **Distribute**:\n   $$\n   y = 2x^2 - 12x + 18 + 4\n   $$\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   $$\n   y = 2x^2 - 12x + 22\n   $$\n\nThus, the standard form of the quadratic equation is:\n$$\ny = 2x^2 - 12x + 22\n$$\n\nBy following these steps, you can convert any quadratic equation from vertex form to standard form effectively.
