    Which quadrant contains points with both positive x and y coordinates?
answer: >-
    The quadrant that contains points with both positive x and y coordinates is **Quadrant I**. In this quadrant, both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are positive, which means any point located here will have coordinates of the form (x, y) where x > 0 and y > 0. \n\nTo summarize the characteristics of all four quadrants in the coordinate plane:\n\n- **Quadrant I:** x > 0, y > 0 (both coordinates are positive)\n- **Quadrant II:** x < 0, y > 0 (x is negative, y is positive)\n- **Quadrant III:** x < 0, y < 0 (both coordinates are negative)\n- **Quadrant IV:** x > 0, y < 0 (x is positive, y is negative)\n\nUnderstanding these quadrants is essential for graphing and interpreting the location of points in the coordinate plane.
