    What are compound inequalities and how are they solved?
answer: >-
    Compound inequalities are mathematical expressions that combine two separate inequalities using the words "and" or "or." The way these inequalities are combined affects the solution set.\n\n1. **Types of Compound Inequalities**:\n   - **Conjunction (AND)**: This type of compound inequality requires that both inequalities must be true simultaneously. The solution set is the intersection of the two individual solution sets. For example, in the compound inequality $x > 1$ AND $x \leq 4$, the solution is $1 < x \leq 4$, which can be represented in interval notation as $(1, 4]$.\n   - **Disjunction (OR)**: In this case, only one of the inequalities needs to be true. The solution set is the union of the two individual solution sets. For example, in the compound inequality $x < 3$ OR $x > 7$, the solution includes all values less than 3 and all values greater than 7, which can be represented in interval notation as \((-\infty, 3) \cup (7, \infty)\).\n\n2. **Solving Compound Inequalities**:\n   - **For AND**: To solve a compound inequality with "and," you solve each inequality separately and then find the overlap of the solutions. For example, to solve $2x < 14$ and $x > -1$:\n     - Solve $2x < 14$ to get $x < 7$.\n     - The solution set is $x > -1$ AND $x < 7$, which gives the final solution $ -1 < x < 7$ or in interval notation \((-1, 7)\).\n   \n   - **For OR**: To solve a compound inequality with "or," you also solve each inequality separately, but you combine all solutions. For example, to solve $x \leq -1$ OR $x > 2$:\n     - The solution set includes all values $x \leq -1$ and $x > 2$, which can be expressed in interval notation as \((-\infty, -1] \cup (2, \infty)\).\n\n3. **Graphing Solutions**: \n   - When graphing compound inequalities, you represent the solution sets on a number line. For "and" inequalities, you shade the region where both conditions overlap. For "or" inequalities, you shade the regions that satisfy either condition.\n\n4. **Example Problems**:\n   - Solve the compound inequality $-2 < 2x - 3 < 5$:\n     - Break it into two parts: \n       1. $-2 < 2x - 3$ leads to $x > \frac{1}{2}$.\n       2. $2x - 3 < 5$ leads to $x < 4$.\n     - The solution is $\frac{1}{2} < x < 4$ or in interval notation \((\frac{1}{2}, 4)\).\n\nIn summary, compound inequalities are a powerful tool in mathematics that allow for the combination of multiple conditions. Understanding how to solve and graph these inequalities is essential for working with more complex mathematical concepts.
