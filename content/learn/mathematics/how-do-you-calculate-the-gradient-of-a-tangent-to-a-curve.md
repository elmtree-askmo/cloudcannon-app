answer: >-
    To calculate the gradient of a tangent to a curve, you follow a systematic process that involves derivatives. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Let the curve be defined by the function \( y = f(x) \).\n\n2. **Find the Derivative**: The first step is to compute the derivative of the function, denoted as \( f'(x) \) or $ \frac{dy}{dx} $. This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point $ x $ on the curve.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Derivative at the Point of Interest**: To find the slope of the tangent line at a specific point \( (x_0, y_0) \), substitute $ x_0 $ into the derivative:\n   $$\n   m = f'(x_0)\n   $$\n   Here, $ m $ is the gradient (slope) of the tangent line at the point \( (x_0, y_0) \).\n\n4. **Determine the Equation of the Tangent Line**: Once you have the gradient, you can find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:\n   $$\n   y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\n   $$\n   where \( (x_0, y_0) \) is the point on the curve and $ m $ is the slope obtained from the derivative.\n\n### Example:\nFor instance, if you have the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and you want to find the gradient of the tangent at the point \( (1, 1) \):\n\n1. **Find the Derivative**:\n   $$ \n   f'(x) = 2x \n   $$\n\n2. **Evaluate the Derivative at $ x = 1 $**:\n   $$\n   m = f'(1) = 2(1) = 2\n   $$\n\n3. **Equation of the Tangent Line**:\n   Using the point-slope form:\n   $$\n   y - 1 = 2(x - 1)\n   $$\n   Simplifying gives:\n   $$\n   y = 2x - 1\n   $$\n\nIn summary, the gradient of a tangent to a curve at a specific point is calculated using the derivative of the function at that point, which provides the slope of the tangent line. A positive gradient indicates the function is increasing at that point, while a negative gradient indicates it is decreasing.
