    How are the kernel and image of a linear transformation defined?
answer: >-
    In linear algebra, the kernel and image of a linear transformation are fundamental concepts that help to understand the properties and behavior of the transformation.\n\n1. **Kernel**: The kernel of a linear transformation $ T: V \to W $ is defined as the set of all vectors in the domain $ V $ that are mapped to the zero vector in the codomain $ W $. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \text{Ker}(T) = \{ v \in V \mid T(v) = 0 \}\n   $$\n   The kernel is a linear subspace of the domain $ V $. It provides insight into the solutions of the equation \( T(v) = 0 \) and indicates the degree of non-injectivity of the transformation.\n\n2. **Image**: The image of a linear transformation, also known as the range, is the set of all vectors in the codomain $ W $ that can be expressed as \( T(v) \) for some vector $ v \in V $. It is defined as:\n   $$\n   \text{Im}(T) = \{ T(v) \mid v \in V \}\n   $$\n   The image is a subspace of the codomain $ W $ and reflects the output of the transformation, indicating how much of the codomain is "covered" by the transformation.\n\nThese two concepts are crucial in understanding the structure of linear transformations, particularly in relation to the rank-nullity theorem, which states that the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image equals the dimension of the domain:\n$$\n\text{dim}(\text{Ker}(T)) + \text{dim}(\text{Im}(T)) = \text{dim}(V)\n$$\n\nIn summary, the kernel and image of a linear transformation provide essential information about the transformation's injectivity and surjectivity, respectively, and are key to many applications in linear algebra, including solving systems of linear equations and analyzing vector spaces.
