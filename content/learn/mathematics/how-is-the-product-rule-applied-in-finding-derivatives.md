    How is the product rule applied in finding derivatives?
answer: >-
    The product rule is a fundamental concept in calculus used to find the derivative of the product of two or more differentiable functions. It is particularly useful when dealing with functions that are multiplied together, allowing for differentiation without the need to expand the product first.\n\n### Definition of the Product Rule\n\nFor two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), the product rule states that the derivative of their product \( P(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x) \) is given by:\n\n$$\nP'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\n$$\n\nIn Leibniz notation, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\n$$\n\n### Steps to Apply the Product Rule\n\n1. **Identify the Functions**: Determine the two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) that are being multiplied.\n2. **Differentiate Each Function**: Compute the derivatives \( f'(x) \) and \( g'(x) \).\n3. **Apply the Product Rule Formula**: Substitute the functions and their derivatives into the product rule formula.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate the application of the product rule. Suppose we want to find the derivative of the function:\n\n$$\nf(x) = (6x^3)(7x^4)\n$$\n\n1. Identify the functions:\n   - \( f(x) = 6x^3 \)\n   - \( g(x) = 7x^4 \)\n\n2. Differentiate each function:\n   - \( f'(x) = 18x^2 \)\n   - \( g'(x) = 28x^3 \)\n\n3. Apply the product rule:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) = (18x^2)(7x^4) + (6x^3)(28x^3)\n   $$\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 126x^6 + 168x^6 = 294x^6\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product rule is a powerful tool in calculus that simplifies the process of finding derivatives of products of functions. It allows for efficient differentiation without the need for expansion, making it particularly useful for complex functions. The rule can also be extended to more than two functions, maintaining the same principle of combining the derivatives appropriately.
