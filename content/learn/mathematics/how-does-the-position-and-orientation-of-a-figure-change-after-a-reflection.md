    How does the position and orientation of a figure change after a reflection?
answer: >-
    The position and orientation of a figure change in specific ways after a reflection across a line of reflection. Here are the key aspects to consider:\n\n1. **Position**: The reflected image is positioned symmetrically relative to the line of reflection. For example, if a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). This means that the distance from the original point to the line of reflection is equal to the distance from the reflected point to the line.\n\n2. **Orientation**: While the size and shape of the figure remain unchanged, the orientation of the reflected image is laterally inverted. This means that the image appears flipped. For instance, if a figure is reflected over the y-axis, any features that were on the left side of the figure will now appear on the right side, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same dimensions and shape. This is a property of isometric transformations, which preserve distances between points.\n\n4. **Examples of Reflections**:\n   - Reflecting a point \( (3, 4) \) over the y-axis results in the new coordinates \( (-3, 4) \).\n   - For a function \( f(x) = x^2 \), reflecting it over the x-axis results in $ y = -x^2 $, which flips the parabola upside down.\n\n5. **Line of Reflection**: The line of reflection acts as a mirror. Common lines of reflection include the x-axis, y-axis, and the line $y = x$. The choice of line affects how the figure is transformed.\n\nIn summary, after a reflection, the figure's position is symmetrically opposite to its original position relative to the line of reflection, and its orientation is reversed, while maintaining congruence in size and shape.
