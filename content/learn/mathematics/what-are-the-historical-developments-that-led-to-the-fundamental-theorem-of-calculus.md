answer: >-
    The historical development of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is a fascinating journey that spans several centuries and involves numerous mathematicians. The theorem itself, which establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, is often attributed to Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who independently formulated it in the late 17th century.\n\n1. **Early Foundations**: The roots of calculus can be traced back to ancient Greek mathematicians who explored concepts of area and volume. They used methods such as the method of exhaustion, which approximated areas by inscribing polygons within figures. This laid the groundwork for later developments in integral calculus.\n\n2. **Medieval Contributions**: During the medieval period, mathematicians like Alhazen and later, in the 17th century, Fermat began to formalize the ideas of tangents and areas, which are central to calculus. Fermat's work on finding maxima and minima of functions contributed to the understanding of derivatives.\n\n3. **The 17th Century**: The significant leap towards the FTC occurred in the 17th century. Newton, in his work on "fluxions" (his term for derivatives), and Leibniz, who developed a notation for calculus, both made substantial contributions. Newton's tract on fluxions, written in 1666, outlined his ideas on the relationship between motion and change, which are foundational to calculus.\n\n4. **Formalization of the Theorem**: The FTC itself was articulated in two parts:\n   - The first part states that if a function is continuous on an interval, then the integral of that function can be computed using its antiderivative.\n   - The second part establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. This connection was crucial for the development of calculus as a unified field.\n\n5. **Recognition and Controversy**: The contributions of Newton and Leibniz led to a famous dispute over priority in the discovery of calculus, which overshadowed the contributions of other mathematicians. However, it is important to recognize that many others, including Torricelli, Mengoli, and Angeli, also played roles in the evolution of these ideas.\n\n6. **Impact on Mathematics and Science**: The FTC has become one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics, linking the concepts of area (integrals) and rate of change (derivatives). Its implications extend beyond mathematics into physics, engineering, and economics, making it a fundamental result in the quantitative language of science.\n\nIn summary, the development of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus was a cumulative effort that built upon the work of many mathematicians over centuries, culminating in the formalization of the theorem by Newton and Leibniz in the late 1600s. This theorem not only unified the concepts of differentiation and integration but also paved the way for the advancement of modern mathematics and its applications.
