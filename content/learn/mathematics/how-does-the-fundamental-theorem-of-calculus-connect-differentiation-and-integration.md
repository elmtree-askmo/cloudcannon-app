    How does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connect differentiation and integration?
answer: >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) establishes a profound connection between differentiation and integration, which are two core concepts in calculus. The theorem is divided into two parts, each highlighting different aspects of this relationship.\n\n1. **First Part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: This part states that if \( f \) is a continuous function on the interval \([a, b]\) and \( F \) is an antiderivative of \( f \) (meaning \( F' = f \)), then the function \( F \) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\). This establishes that the process of integration (finding the area under the curve of \( f \)) can be reversed by differentiation. In essence, it shows that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.\n\n2. **Second Part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: This part provides a method for evaluating definite integrals. It states that if \( f \) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and \( F \) is an antiderivative of \( f \), then:\n   $$\n   \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n   $$\n   This means that to compute the definite integral of \( f \) from \( a \) to \( b \), one can simply evaluate the antiderivative \( F \) at the endpoints \( b \) and \( a \) and subtract the two results. This not only provides a practical computational tool but also reinforces the idea that integration accumulates the values of \( f \) over the interval, while differentiation gives the rate of change of \( F \).\n\nIn summary, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus elegantly connects differentiation and integration by demonstrating that they are inverse processes. This connection is foundational in calculus, allowing mathematicians and scientists to solve complex problems across various fields by switching between these two operations.
