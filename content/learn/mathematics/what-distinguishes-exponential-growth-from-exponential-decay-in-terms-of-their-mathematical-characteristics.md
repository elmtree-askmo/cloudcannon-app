    What distinguishes exponential growth from exponential decay in terms of their mathematical characteristics?
answer: >-
    Exponential growth and exponential decay are two distinct behaviors of exponential functions, characterized primarily by the value of the base $ b $ in the exponential function of the form $ y = a \cdot b^x $.\n\n### Exponential Growth\n- **Definition**: Exponential growth occurs when the base $ b $ is greater than 1 (i.e., $ b > 1 $). This means that as $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ increases rapidly.\n- **Mathematical Characteristics**:\n  - The function increases by a constant multiplicative factor for each unit increase in $ x $. For example, if $ b = 2 $, the function doubles for each increment of 1 in $ x $.\n  - The graph of an exponential growth function rises steeply and approaches a horizontal asymptote (usually the x-axis, $ y = 0 $) as $ x $ approaches negative infinity.\n- **Example**: A population of bacteria that doubles every hour can be modeled by an exponential growth function, such as $ y = 2^x $.\n\n### Exponential Decay\n- **Definition**: Exponential decay occurs when the base $ b $ is between 0 and 1 (i.e., $ 0 < b < 1 $). In this case, as $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ decreases rapidly.\n- **Mathematical Characteristics**:\n  - The function decreases by a constant multiplicative factor for each unit increase in $ x $. For example, if $ b = 0.5 $, the function halves for each increment of 1 in $ x $.\n  - The graph of an exponential decay function also approaches a horizontal asymptote (the x-axis, $ y = 0 $) but from above, as $ x $ increases.\n- **Example**: The amount of a radioactive substance that decays over time can be modeled by an exponential decay function, such as \( y = 10 \cdot (0.5)^x \).\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Base Value**: \n  - Growth: $ b > 1 $\n  - Decay: $ 0 < b < 1 $\n- **Behavior**:\n  - Growth: Rapid increase\n  - Decay: Rapid decrease\n- **Graphical Representation**: Both types of functions approach the x-axis as an asymptote, but growth functions rise steeply while decay functions fall steeply.\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is crucial for modeling real-world phenomena, such as population dynamics and radioactive decay, where the nature of change can significantly impact predictions and analyses.
