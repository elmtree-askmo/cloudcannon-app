    To solve inequalities involving absolute values, students can follow a systematic approach that typically involves breaking the problem down into simpler parts. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Understand the Absolute Value**: The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. For an expression $ |x| $, it can be defined as:\n   - $ x $ if $ x \geq 0 $\n   - $ -x $ if $ x < 0 $\n\n2. **Set Up the Inequality**: When dealing with an absolute value inequality, you need to consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value. For example, if you have an inequality like $ |x + 3| > 1 $, you can break it down into two separate inequalities:\n   - $ x + 3 > 1 $\n   - $ x + 3 < -1 $\n\n3. **Solve Each Case**:\n   - For $ x + 3 > 1 $:\n     - Subtract 3 from both sides: $ x > -2 $\n   - For $ x + 3 < -1 $:\n     - Subtract 3 from both sides: $ x < -4 $\n\n4. **Combine the Solutions**: The solutions from both cases give you the final answer. In this example, the solution set is $ x < -4 $ or $ x > -2 $.\n\n5. **Graph the Solution**: It can be helpful to graph the solution on a number line to visualize the intervals that satisfy the inequality.\n\n6. **Check for Compound Inequalities**: If the absolute value inequality is of the form $ |x| < a $ (where $ a $ is a positive number), it can be rewritten as a compound inequality:\n   - $ -a < x < a $\n\n7. **Consider Special Cases**: If the inequality involves less than or equal to (e.g., $ |x| \leq a $), the solution will include the endpoints:\n   - $ -a \leq x \leq a $\n\n8. **Practice with Examples**: To solidify understanding, students should practice with various examples, such as:\n   - Solve $ |2x - 5| - 3 \geq 6 $\n   - Solve $ |3x + 2| + 6 < 2 $\n\nBy following these steps, students can effectively approach and solve absolute value inequalities, gaining confidence in their problem-solving skills.
