    What is the inter-quartile range and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    The inter-quartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion that quantifies the spread of the middle 50% of a dataset. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1):\n\n$$\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n$$\n\nTo calculate the IQR, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Order the Data**: Arrange the dataset in ascending order.\n2. **Determine Q1 and Q3**:\n   - **Q1 (First Quartile)**: This is the median of the first half of the data (the lower 25%).\n   - **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: This is the median of the second half of the data (the upper 25%).\n3. **Calculate the IQR**: Subtract Q1 from Q3.\n\nFor example, if you have a dataset and find that Q1 is 10 and Q3 is 20, then the IQR would be:\n\n$$\nIQR = 20 - 10 = 10\n$$\n\nThe IQR is particularly useful for identifying outliers in the data, as it provides a measure of variability that is not affected by extreme values. It is often visualized using boxplots, where the box represents the IQR, and the 'whiskers' extend to the minimum and maximum values of the dataset.
