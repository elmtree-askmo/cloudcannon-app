    How do you reflect a point across the x-axis?
answer: >-
    To reflect a point across the x-axis, you follow a simple transformation of its coordinates. The process is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Original Point**: Let the original point be represented as \( P(x, y) \).\n\n2. **Transform the Coordinates**: To reflect this point across the x-axis, you keep the x-coordinate the same and negate the y-coordinate. The new coordinates after reflection will be:\n   $$\n   P'(x, -y)\n   $$\n\n### Example\nIf you have a point \( P(3, 4) \), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new point $ P' $ will be:\n$$\nP'(3, -4)\n$$\n\nThis transformation effectively flips the point vertically over the x-axis, creating a mirror image of the original point with respect to that axis.
