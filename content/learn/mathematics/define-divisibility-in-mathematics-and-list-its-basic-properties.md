    Define divisibility in mathematics and list its basic properties.
answer: >-
    Divisibility in mathematics is a fundamental concept that describes the relationship between two integers. Specifically, if $a$ and $b$ are integers, we say that $a$ divides $b$ (denoted as $a \mid b$) if there exists an integer $q$ such that:\n\n$$\nb = aq\n$$\n\nIn this case, $a$ is referred to as a divisor or factor of $b$, and $b$ is said to be divisible by $a$. If $a$ does not divide $b$, we denote this as $a \nmid b$.\n\n### Basic Properties of Divisibility\n\n1. **Transitivity**: If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$. This means that if $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ must also divide $c$.\n\n2. **Closure under Addition**: If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$, then \(a \mid (b + c)\). This property states that if $a$ divides both $b$ and $c$, then $a$ also divides their sum.\n\n3. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: If $a \mid b$, then for any integer $k$, \(a \mid (kb)\). This means that if $a$ divides $b$, it will also divide any integer multiple of $b$.\n\n4. **Divisibility by Factors**: If $a \mid b$, then $a$ is also divisible by any of its factors. For example, if $48$ is divisible by $12$ (since $48 = 12 \times 4$), then $48$ is also divisible by the factors of $12$ (which are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$ and $12$).\n\n5. **Divisibility by Zero**: The only integer that divides zero is zero itself. For any integer $b$, $0 \mid b$ is not defined unless $b = 0$.\n\n6. **Negative Divisibility**: If $a \mid b$, then $-a \mid b$ as well. This means that if $a$ divides $b$, then the negative of $a$ will also divide $b$.\n\nThese properties form the basis for many mathematical proofs and are essential in number theory, particularly in the study of integers and their relationships. Understanding these properties can help in solving problems related to divisibility and in applying techniques such as proof by induction.
