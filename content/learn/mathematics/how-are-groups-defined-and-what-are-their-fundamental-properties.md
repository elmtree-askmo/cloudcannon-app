    How are groups defined and what are their fundamental properties?
answer: >-
    In mathematics, a group is defined as an ordered pair \((G, *)\) where $G$ is a set and $*$ is a binary operation on $G$ that satisfies four fundamental properties:\n\n1. **Closure**: For every pair of elements $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation $a * b$ is also an element of $G$. This means that performing the operation on elements of the group will not produce an element outside the group.\n\n2. **Associativity**: For all elements $a, b, c \in G$, the equation \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\) holds. This property ensures that the way in which the elements are grouped during the operation does not affect the outcome.\n\n3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for every element $g \in G$, the equation $e * g = g * e = g$ holds. This element $e$ is known as the identity element of the group.\n\n4. **Inverse Element**: For every element $g \in G$, there exists an element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g * g^{-1} = g^{-1} * g = e$. This means that every element in the group has an inverse that, when combined with the original element, yields the identity element.\n\nIf a group also satisfies the commutative property, meaning $a * b = b * a$ for all $a, b \in G$, it is referred to as an **Abelian group** (or commutative group).\n\nExamples of groups include:\n- The set of integers \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\) under addition, where the identity element is $0$ and the inverse of any integer $n$ is $-n$.\n- The set of non-zero rational numbers \((\mathbb{Q}^*, \times)\) under multiplication, where the identity element is $1$ and the inverse of any rational number $q$ is $1/q$.\n\nGroup theory is a fundamental area of abstract algebra and has applications across various fields of mathematics and science.
