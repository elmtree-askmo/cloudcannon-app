    What is the domain and range of a function, and how are they represented in function notation?
answer: >-
    The domain and range of a function are fundamental concepts in mathematics that describe the set of possible input and output values, respectively.\n\n### Domain\nThe **domain** of a function is defined as the set of all possible input values (typically represented as $x$-values) for which the function is defined. To determine the domain, one must consider any mathematical restrictions that could affect the input values. Common restrictions include:\n\n1. **Division by Zero**: If a function involves division, any value that makes the denominator zero is excluded from the domain. For example, in the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}\), the value $x = 2$ is not in the domain, which can be expressed as \((-∞, 2) \cup (2, ∞)\).\n\n2. **Square Roots**: For functions involving square roots, the expression under the square root must be non-negative. For instance, in \(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\), the domain is \([0, ∞)\).\n\n3. **Logarithms**: For logarithmic functions, the argument must be positive. For example, \(f(x) = \log(x)\) has a domain of \((0, ∞)\).\n\n### Range\nThe **range** of a function is the set of all possible output values (typically represented as $y$-values) that the function can produce based on its domain. To determine the range, one typically analyzes the function's behavior, including its maximum and minimum values, and any restrictions that may apply due to the nature of the function.\n\nFor example:\n- For the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\), the range is also \([0, ∞)\) since the output values are always non-negative.\n- For an exponential function of the form \(f(t) = A \cdot B^t\) (where $A > 0$), the range is \((0, ∞)\), meaning the output values are always positive.\n\n### Representation in Function Notation\nIn function notation, the domain and range can be represented as follows:\n\n- **Domain**: If $f: X \to Y$, where $X$ is the domain, it indicates that the function $f$ takes inputs from the set $X$.\n- **Range**: The range can be denoted as the set of values \(f(X)\) that the function can output, often expressed in interval notation.\n\nFor example, if we have a function defined as \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), we can state:\n- Domain: \(x \in (-∞, 0) \cup (0, ∞)\)\n- Range: \(y \in (-∞, 0) \cup (0, ∞)\)\n\nIn summary, the domain and range are crucial for understanding the behavior of functions, and they can be effectively represented in function notation to clarify the valid input and output values.
