    What role do boundary values play in the evaluation of definite integrals?
answer: >-
    Boundary values play a crucial role in the evaluation of definite integrals, as they define the specific interval over which the integral is calculated. A definite integral is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\n$$\n\nwhere \(a\) and \(b\) are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively. These limits determine the range of the function \(f(x)\) that is being integrated, and they are essential for calculating the area under the curve of the function between these two points.\n\n1. **Area Representation**: The definite integral represents the net area between the curve of the function \(f(x)\) and the x-axis from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\). If the function is above the x-axis, the area is positive; if it is below, the area is negative. The boundary values \(a\) and \(b\) thus directly influence the total area calculated by the integral.\n\n2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral can be evaluated using the antiderivative \(F(x)\) of \(f(x)\) as follows:\n\n$$\n\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n$$\n\nThis theorem highlights that the evaluation of the definite integral depends on the values of the antiderivative at the boundaries \(a\) and \(b\).\n\n3. **Existence of the Integral**: For a function to be integrable over the interval \([a, b]\), the limit defining the integral must exist. This is often verified through Riemann sums, which approximate the area under the curve by partitioning the interval into smaller segments. The choice of boundaries \(a\) and \(b\) is critical in determining whether the function meets the criteria for integrability.\n\n4. **Applications**: In practical applications, such as calculating total distance traveled or the area of a region, the boundary values are essential for defining the specific segment of interest. For example, if you want to find the total distance traveled by an object from time \(t = a\) to \(t = b\), the definite integral of the velocity function over that interval will provide the answer.\n\nIn summary, boundary values are fundamental to the evaluation of definite integrals as they define the interval of integration, influence the area calculation, and are integral to the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
