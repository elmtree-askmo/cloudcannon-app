answer: >-
    Complex numbers are defined as numbers of the form $ a + bi $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are real numbers, and $ i $ is the imaginary unit, characterized by the property $ i^2 = -1 $. This definition allows for the extension of the real number system to include solutions to equations that do not have real solutions, such as $ x^2 + 1 = 0 $, which has the complex solutions $ i $ and $ -i $.\n\n### Properties of Complex Numbers\n1. **Addition and Subtraction**:\n   - For two complex numbers $ z_1 = a + bi $ and $ z_2 = c + di $:\n     - **Addition**:\n       $$\n       z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i\n       $$\n     - **Subtraction**:\n       $$\n       z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + (b - d)i\n       $$\n\n2. **Multiplication**:\n   - The multiplication of two complex numbers $ z_1 = a + bi $ and $ z_2 = c + di $ is given by:\n     $$\n     z_1 \cdot z_2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\n     $$\n   - This operation utilizes the property $ i^2 = -1 $.\n\n3. **Division**:\n   - To divide two complex numbers $ z_1 = a + bi $ and $ z_2 = c + di $, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n     $$\n     \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{c^2 + d^2} = \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}\n     $$\n\n4. **Complex Conjugate**:\n   - The conjugate of a complex number $ z = a + bi $ is defined as:\n     $$\n     \overline{z} = a - bi\n     $$\n   - The conjugate is useful in various operations, particularly in division.\n\n5. **Magnitude (Norm)**:\n   - The magnitude (or norm) of a complex number $ z = a + bi $ is given by:\n     $$\n     |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n     $$\n   - This represents the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane.\n\n6. **Polar Form**:\n   - Complex numbers can also be expressed in polar form as:\n     $$\n     z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\n     $$\n   - Here, $ r $ is the magnitude of the complex number, and $ \theta $ is the argument (angle) of the complex number.\n\n### Applications\nComplex numbers are widely used in various fields, including engineering, physics, and applied mathematics, particularly in solving quadratic equations and in the analysis of electrical circuits, signal processing, and control theory.\n\nIn summary, complex numbers extend the real number system and allow for a rich set of operations and properties that are essential in many areas of mathematics and its applications.
