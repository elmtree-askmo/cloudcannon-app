    How can you determine if two lines are parallel based on their slopes?
answer: >-
    To determine if two lines are parallel, you can analyze their slopes, which are derived from their equations. Parallel lines are defined as lines that never intersect and maintain the same slope throughout their length. This characteristic is fundamental in geometry and is crucial for solving various mathematical problems related to angles, distances, and line equations.\n\nIf the lines are expressed in the slope-intercept form, which is given by:\n\n$$\ny = m_1x + b_1\n$$\n\nand \n\n$$\ny = m_2x + b_2,\n$$\n\nthe lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, meaning:\n\n$$\nm_1 = m_2.\n$$\n\nFor example, consider the lines represented by the equations $ y = 2x + 1 $ and $ y = 2x - 3 $. Both lines have a slope of 2, thus confirming that they are parallel.\n\nIn summary, the key characteristics of parallel lines are:\n- They never intersect.\n- They have identical slopes.\n\nThis method of comparing slopes is a straightforward and effective way to determine the relationship between two lines in a coordinate system.
