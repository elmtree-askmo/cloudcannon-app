    What is the definition of a basis in a vector space?
answer: >-
    A basis of a vector space is defined as a set of vectors that satisfies two key conditions: \n\n1. **Spanning**: The set must span the vector space, meaning that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis.\n2. **Linear Independence**: The vectors in the set must be linearly independent, which means that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the basis provides a coordinate system for the vector space, allowing every vector in that space to be uniquely represented as a finite sum of multiples of the basis vectors. \n\nThe number of vectors in a basis is referred to as the dimension of the vector space. For example, in the two-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$, a common basis is the set of vectors $\{(1, 0), (0, 1)\}$, which spans the space and is linearly independent. \n\nIt is important to note that a vector space can have multiple bases. For instance, both $\{(1, 0), (0, 1)\}$ and $\{(1, 1), (1, -1)\}$ are valid bases for $\mathbb{R}^2$, as they both consist of two linearly independent vectors that span the space. \n\nIn summary, a basis is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that allows for the representation and manipulation of vectors within a vector space.
