    What are the key differences in the average rate of change between quadratic and exponential functions over the same interval?
answer: >-
    The average rate of change (ARC) of a function over an interval $[a, b]$ is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nWhen comparing quadratic functions, such as \(f(x) = x^2\), and exponential functions, such as \(g(x) = 2^x\), there are key differences in their average rates of change over the same interval.\n\n### Quadratic Functions\nQuadratic functions are polynomial functions of degree 2, and their graphs are parabolas. The average rate of change for a quadratic function can vary significantly depending on the interval chosen. For example:\n\n- For the function \(f(x) = x^2\), if we calculate the average rate of change from $x=1$ to $x=3$:\n  $$\n  \text{ARC} = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4.\n  $$\n- If we calculate it from $x=0$ to $x=2$:\n  $$\n  \text{ARC} = \frac{f(2) - f(0)}{2 - 0} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2.\n  $$\n\nThis shows that the average rate of change can be different based on the interval, reflecting the parabolic nature of the function where the rate of change increases as $x$ increases.\n\n### Exponential Functions\nExponential functions, on the other hand, grow (or decay) at a rate proportional to their current value. For the function \(g(x) = 2^x\), the average rate of change also varies, but it tends to increase more rapidly than that of quadratic functions as $x$ increases. For example:\n\n- From $x=1$ to $x=3$:\n  $$\n  \text{ARC} = \frac{g(3) - g(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{8 - 2}{2} = 3.\n  $$\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Growth Rate**: Exponential functions generally exhibit a much faster growth rate compared to quadratic functions as $x$ increases. This is evident in the average rates of change calculated over the same intervals.\n  \n2. **Behavior Over Intervals**: The average rate of change for quadratic functions can be relatively stable over smaller intervals but increases as $x$ increases. In contrast, the average rate of change for exponential functions increases more dramatically, reflecting their nature of rapid growth.\n\n3. **Graph Interpretation**: When graphed, the quadratic function will show a parabolic curve, while the exponential function will show a J-shaped curve, indicating that the exponential function will eventually surpass the quadratic function in growth.\n\nIn summary, while both types of functions can be analyzed using the average rate of change, exponential functions typically have a higher and more rapidly increasing average rate of change compared to quadratic functions over the same intervals.
