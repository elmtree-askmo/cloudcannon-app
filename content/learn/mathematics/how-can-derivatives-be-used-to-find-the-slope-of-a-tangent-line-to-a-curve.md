    How can derivatives be used to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve?
answer: >-
    Derivatives are a fundamental concept in calculus that allow us to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at any given point. The slope of the tangent line represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point.\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line to a curve defined by a function \( f(x) \), we use the definition of the derivative. The derivative \( f'(x) \) is defined as:\n\n$$\nf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\n$$\n\nThis formula calculates the average rate of change of the function over an interval of width $ h $ as $ h $ approaches zero. Essentially, it measures how much the function \( f(x) \) changes as we make an infinitesimally small change in $ x $.\n\nFor example, if we have a function \( f(x) = x^2 \), we can find its derivative:\n\n1. Substitute into the derivative formula:\n   $$ \n   f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h} \n   $$\n\n2. Simplify the expression:\n   $$\n   = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h} \n   = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h} \n   = \lim_{h \to 0} (2x + h) \n   = 2x\n   $$\n\nThus, the derivative \( f'(x) = 2x \) indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the curve $ y = x^2 $ at any point $ x $ is $ 2x $. \n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at a specific point, say $ x = 3 $, we simply substitute $ 3 $ into the derivative:\n\n$$\nf'(3) = 2(3) = 6\n$$\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point \( (3, 9) \) (since \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)) is $ 6 $.\n\nIn summary, derivatives provide a powerful tool for determining the slope of tangent lines to curves, which is essential for understanding the behavior of functions in calculus.
