    What is the general form of a cube root function?
answer: >-
    The general form of a cube root function is given by:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}\n$$\n\nThis function is defined for all real numbers, meaning its domain and range are both \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This characteristic distinguishes cube root functions from square root functions, which are only defined for non-negative numbers.\n\n### Key Features of Cube Root Functions:\n1. **Continuity**: Cube root functions are continuous across their entire domain.\n2. **Graph Shape**: The graph of \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \) passes through the origin (0,0) and has a characteristic S-shape, increasing steadily as $ x $ moves from negative to positive values.\n3. **No Maximum or Minimum**: The function does not have any maximum or minimum values, as it extends infinitely in both the positive and negative directions.\n\n### Graphing Techniques:\nTo graph a cube root function, you can create a table of values using perfect cubes (e.g., $-27, -8, -1, 0, 1, 8, 27$) to find corresponding $ y $-values. Plotting these points and connecting them with a smooth curve will yield the graph of the function.\n\n### Comparison with Square Root Functions:\nCube root functions differ from square root functions in that they are defined for all real numbers, while square root functions are only defined for non-negative inputs. This leads to different behaviors and characteristics in their graphs.\n\nIn summary, the general form of a cube root function is \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} \), and it exhibits unique properties that make it an important function in mathematics.
