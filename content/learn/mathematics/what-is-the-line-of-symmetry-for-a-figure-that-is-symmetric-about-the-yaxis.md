    The line of symmetry for a figure symmetric about the Y-axis is the Y-axis itself, represented by the equation x=0. This property indicates that each point on the figure has a corresponding point on the opposite side of the Y-axis.

    What is the line of symmetry for a figure that is symmetric about the Y-axis?
answer: >-
    The line of symmetry for a figure that is symmetric about the Y-axis is the Y-axis itself. This means that for any point \((x, y)\) on the figure, there exists a corresponding point \((-x, y)\) that is also on the figure. This property indicates that the figure is mirrored across the Y-axis.\n\nFor example, consider the function $y = x^2$. The graph of this function is a parabola that opens upwards and is symmetric about the Y-axis. If you take a point on the graph, such as \((2, 4)\), you will find that the point \((-2, 4)\) is also on the graph, confirming the symmetry about the Y-axis.\n\nIn general, any figure that exhibits symmetry about the Y-axis will have the line of symmetry defined by the equation $x = 0$, which represents the Y-axis in the coordinate plane. This concept is particularly useful in graphing, as it allows for the reduction of the number of points that need to be plotted by reflecting points across the Y-axis.
