answer: >-
    To calculate the number of subsets of a set, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Number of Subsets} = 2^n\n$$\n\nwhere $ n $ is the number of elements in the set. This formula accounts for all possible combinations of the elements, including the empty set and the set itself.\n\nFor example, if you have a set $ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $, which contains 3 elements, the number of subsets of $ A $ would be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{Number of Subsets} = 2^3 = 8\n$$\n\nThis means that the set $ A $ has 8 subsets, which include:\n\n1. The empty set: $ \emptyset $\n2. $ \{1\} $\n3. $ \{2\} $\n4. $ \{3\} $\n5. $ \{1, 2\} $\n6. $ \{1, 3\} $\n7. $ \{2, 3\} $\n8. The set itself: $ \{1, 2, 3\} $\n\nThus, the formula $ 2^n $ is a fundamental concept in set theory for determining the number of subsets.
