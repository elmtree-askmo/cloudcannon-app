    What is an inverse function, and how can it be graphically represented?
answer: >-
    An inverse function is a function that reverses the effect of the original function. If we have a function \( f(x) \), its inverse is denoted as \( f^{-1}(x) \). The defining property of inverse functions is that applying the function and then its inverse returns the original input: \n\n$$\nf(f^{-1}(x)) = x\n$$\n\nFor example, if we consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) (restricted to non-negative values), its inverse is the principal square root function \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \).\n\n### Graphical Representation of Inverse Functions\n\nGraphically, the relationship between a function and its inverse can be represented by their symmetry with respect to the line $ y = x $. This means that if you take a point \( (a, b) \) on the graph of the function $ f $, the corresponding point \( (b, a) \) will be on the graph of the inverse function $ f^{-1} $.\n\n#### Example\n\n1. **Function**: \( f(x) = x^2 \) (for $ x \geq 0 $)\n2. **Inverse Function**: \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \)\n\nWhen graphed, the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) produces a parabola that opens upwards, while the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \) resembles half of that parabola, starting from the origin and extending to the right.\n\n### Key Features of Graphing Inverse Functions\n\n- **Symmetry**: The graphs of \( f(x) \) and \( f^{-1}(x) \) are symmetric about the line $ y = x $.\n- **Domain and Range**: The domain of the original function becomes the range of the inverse function and vice versa. For the example above:\n  - Domain of \( f(x) = x^2 \): $ x \geq 0 $\n  - Range of \( f(x) = x^2 \): $ y \geq 0 $\n  - Domain of \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \): $ x \geq 0 $\n  - Range of \( f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x} \): $ y \geq 0 $\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding inverse functions is crucial in algebra, particularly in relation to function transformations and symmetry in graphs. The graphical representation not only helps in visualizing the relationship between a function and its inverse but also reinforces the concept of inverse operations in mathematics.
