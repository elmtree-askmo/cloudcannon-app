    The tangent addition formula allows for the calculation of the tangent of the sum of two angles, expressed as tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). This article provides an explanation of the formula and a detailed example with the angles 45° and 30°.

answer: >-
    The tangent addition formula is a fundamental identity in trigonometry that allows us to calculate the tangent of the sum of two angles. The formula is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\n$$\n\nThis formula is particularly useful when you need to find the tangent of an angle that is the sum of two other angles, especially when those angles are known or can be easily calculated.\n\n### Explanation of the Formula\n\n- **$\tan A$** and **$\tan B$** are the tangents of angles **A** and **B**, respectively.\n- The formula states that the tangent of the sum of two angles is equal to the sum of their tangents divided by one minus the product of their tangents.\n\n### Example of Use\n\nLet's use the tangent addition formula to find the value of $\tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ)$.\n\n1. **Identify the angles**: Here, $ A = 45^\circ $ and $ B = 30^\circ $.\n2. **Calculate the tangents**:\n   - \( \tan(45^\circ) = 1 \)\n   - \( \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \)\n\n3. **Substitute into the formula**:\n   $$\n   \tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{\tan(45^\circ) + \tan(30^\circ)}{1 - \tan(45^\circ) \tan(30^\circ)}\n   $$\n   $$\n   = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{1 - 1 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}\n   $$\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - The numerator becomes:\n     $$\n     1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3}}\n     $$\n   - The denominator becomes:\n     $$\n     1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\n     $$\n\n5. **Combine the results**:\n   $$\n   \tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\n   $$\n\n6. **Rationalize the denominator** (if needed):\n   $$\n   = \frac{(\sqrt{3} + 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{3} + 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{4 + 2\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 + \sqrt{3}\n   $$\n\nThus, the value of \( \tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) \) is $ 2 + \sqrt{3} $.\n\nThis example illustrates how the tangent addition formula can be applied to find the tangent of the sum of two angles effectively.
