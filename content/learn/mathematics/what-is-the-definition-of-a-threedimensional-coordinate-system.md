    What is the definition of a three-dimensional coordinate system?
answer: >-
    A three-dimensional coordinate system is a mathematical framework used to determine the position of points in three-dimensional space. It consists of three mutually perpendicular axes: the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the $z$-axis. Each axis represents a number line that includes all real numbers, and together they form a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, often denoted as $ℝ^3$.\n\nIn this system, any point in space can be represented by an ordered triplet of coordinates \((x, y, z)\), where:\n- $x$ indicates the distance from the origin along the $x$-axis,\n- $y$ indicates the distance along the $y$-axis, and\n- $z$ indicates the distance along the $z$-axis.\n\nThe point of intersection of these three axes is known as the origin, denoted as $O$. This coordinate system allows for the visualization and representation of points, lines, and surfaces in three-dimensional space, facilitating various applications in fields such as physics and engineering.
