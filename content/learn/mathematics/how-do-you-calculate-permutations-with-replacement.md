    How do you calculate permutations with replacement?
answer: >-
    To calculate permutations with replacement, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\nP(n, r) = n^r\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ n $ is the number of distinct objects in the set,\n- $ r $ is the number of objects to be arranged.\n\nThis formula reflects the fact that for each of the $ r $ positions in the arrangement, you can choose any of the $ n $ objects. Since replacements are allowed, the same object can be chosen multiple times.\n\n### Example Calculation\nSuppose you have a set of 3 colors: red, green, and blue, and you want to arrange these colors in groups of 2 (with replacement). Here, $ n = 3 $ and $ r = 2 $.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n$$\nP(3, 2) = 3^2 = 9\n$$\n\nThis means there are 9 possible arrangements, which are:\n1. Red, Red\n2. Red, Green\n3. Red, Blue\n4. Green, Red\n5. Green, Green\n6. Green, Blue\n7. Blue, Red\n8. Blue, Green\n9. Blue, Blue\n\nThis method is widely applicable in probability theory and combinatorics, making it a fundamental concept in counting principles.
