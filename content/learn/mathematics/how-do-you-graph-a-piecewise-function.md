    How do you graph a piecewise function?
answer: >-
    To graph a piecewise function, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: A piecewise function is defined by different expressions for different intervals of the independent variable (usually $x$). Each piece of the function applies to a specific interval.\n\n2. **Identify the Intervals**: Look at the function's definition to determine the intervals for which each piece applies. For example, a piecewise function might be defined as:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \n   \begin{cases} \n   3x + 5 & \text{if } -4 \leq x \leq -1 \\ \n   2 & \text{if } -1 < x < 3 \\ \n   -x + 2 & \text{if } 3 \leq x \leq 4 \n   \end{cases}\n   $$\n\n3. **Plot Each Piece**: For each interval, plot the corresponding function. Pay attention to whether the endpoints are included (closed circle) or excluded (open circle). For example, if the interval is inclusive, use a closed dot at the endpoint; if it is exclusive, use an open dot.\n\n4. **Draw the Graph**: Connect the points for each piece of the function according to the defined intervals. Ensure that you accurately represent the behavior of the function in each interval.\n\n5. **Conduct the Vertical Line Test**: After plotting the function, use the vertical line test to confirm that the graph represents a function. If a vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, it is not a function.\n\n6. **Check Continuity**: If required, check if the function is continuous at the boundaries of the intervals. This means that the endpoints of the pieces should meet without any gaps.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively graph a piecewise function and visualize its behavior across different intervals.
