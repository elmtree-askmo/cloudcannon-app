    Describe the process of expressing cube roots in exponential form.
answer: >-
    To express cube roots in exponential form, you can utilize the concept of fractional exponents. The cube root of a number $ x $, denoted as $ \sqrt[3]{x} $, can be rewritten using a fractional exponent as follows:\n\n$$\n\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}\n$$\n\nThis means that the cube root of $ x $ is equivalent to raising $ x $ to the power of $ \frac{1}{3} $. This transformation allows for easier manipulation of expressions involving cube roots, especially when combined with other operations.\n\n### Example:\nFor instance, if you want to express the cube root of 64 in exponential form, you would write:\n\n$$\n\sqrt[3]{64} = 64^{1/3}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this, you can find the cube root of 64, which is 4, since $ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64 $. Therefore:\n\n$$\n64^{1/3} = 4\n$$\n\n### Further Application:\nYou can also combine this with other operations. For example, if you have $ 64^{2/3} $, this expression means you first take the cube root of 64 and then square the result:\n\n1. Find the cube root of 64: $ 64^{1/3} = 4 $\n2. Square the result: $ 4^2 = 16 $\n\nThus, $ 64^{2/3} = 16 $.\n\nThis method of expressing cube roots in exponential form is particularly useful in algebraic manipulations, allowing for the application of various algebraic rules and simplifications.
