    How do sample spaces relate to probability theory?
answer: >-
    In probability theory, the sample space is a fundamental concept that represents the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment or trial. It is denoted typically by the symbol $S$ and is crucial for determining the likelihood of various events occurring within that experiment.\n\nThe relationship between sample spaces and probability theory can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition of Sample Space**: The sample space is the complete collection of all possible outcomes. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the sample space can be represented as $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Each element in this set corresponds to a potential outcome of the die roll.\n\n2. **Probability Assignment**: Each outcome in the sample space can be assigned a probability, which quantifies the likelihood of that outcome occurring. The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space must equal 1. For instance, in the case of a fair die, each outcome has a probability of $ \frac{1}{6} $, leading to a total probability of $1$.\n\n3. **Events and Subsets**: Events are defined as subsets of the sample space. For example, if we define an event $A$ as rolling an even number, then $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$. The probability of event $A$ can be calculated by summing the probabilities of the outcomes that comprise $A$.\n\n4. **Uniform and Non-Uniform Distributions**: While some sample spaces may have equally likely outcomes (uniform distribution), others may not. In cases where outcomes are not equally likely, it is still essential to define the sample space to facilitate the calculation of probabilities, even if the probabilities are not uniform.\n\n5. **Importance in Probability Theory**: Understanding the sample space is critical for mastering probability and statistical theory. It serves as the foundation for more complex concepts such as random variables, probability distributions, and the calculation of expectation and variance.\n\nIn summary, the sample space is integral to probability theory as it lays the groundwork for defining events, assigning probabilities, and conducting probabilistic analysis. It encapsulates all possible outcomes, allowing for a structured approach to understanding randomness and uncertainty in various experiments.
