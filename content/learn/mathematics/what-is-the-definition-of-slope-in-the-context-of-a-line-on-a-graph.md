    What is the definition of slope in the context of a line on a graph?
answer: >-
    In the context of a line on a graph, the slope is a measure of the steepness and direction of the line. It is defined as the ratio of the vertical change (often referred to as "rise") to the horizontal change (referred to as "run") between two points on the line. Mathematically, the slope $ m $ can be expressed using the formula:\n\n$$\nm = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nHere, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are two distinct points on the line. The slope indicates how much the dependent variable $ y $ changes for a unit change in the independent variable $ x $. \n\nFor example, if the slope of a line is 0.6, it means that for every additional unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by 0.6 units. This concept is crucial in understanding linear relationships, where the slope represents a constant rate of change. In practical applications, such as in cost calculations, the slope can represent a cost per unit, as seen in the gathered information where a slope of 0.25 indicates a cost of 25 cents per mile. \n\nOverall, the slope is a fundamental concept in linear equations and mathematical modeling, providing insight into the relationship between variables.
