answer: >-
    Negative exponents are a way to express the reciprocal of a base raised to a positive exponent. The rule for simplifying negative exponents states that if you have a base $ B $ raised to a negative exponent $ -n $, it can be rewritten as the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent $ n $. The formula for this is:\n\n$$\nB^{-n} = \frac{1}{B^n} \quad \text{(for } B \neq 0\text{)}\n$$\n\n### Example of Simplifying Negative Exponents\n\nLet's consider the expression $ x^{-4} $:\n\n1. **Identify the negative exponent**: Here, the base is $ x $ and the exponent is $ -4 $.\n2. **Apply the negative exponent rule**: According to the rule, we can rewrite $ x^{-4} $ as:\n   $$\n   x^{-4} = \frac{1}{x^4}\n   $$\n\n### Additional Example in a More Complex Expression\n\nConsider the expression $ \frac{2x^{-3}}{y^2} $:\n\n1. **Identify the negative exponent**: The term $ x^{-3} $ has a negative exponent.\n2. **Convert the negative exponent**: Rewrite $ x^{-3} $ as $ \frac{1}{x^3} $:\n   $$\n   \frac{2x^{-3}}{y^2} = \frac{2}{x^3 y^2}\n   $$\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, to simplify expressions with negative exponents, you convert them to positive exponents by taking the reciprocal of the base. This process is essential for simplifying algebraic expressions and making them easier to work with.
