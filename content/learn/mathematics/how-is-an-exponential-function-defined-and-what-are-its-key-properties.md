    How is an exponential function defined and what are its key properties?
answer: >-
    An exponential function is a mathematical function defined in the form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = ab^x\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ a $ is a constant known as the coefficient,\n- $ b $ is the base of the exponential function, which is a positive constant,\n- $ x $ is the exponent, which can be any real number.\n\n### Key Properties of Exponential Functions:\n\n1. **Growth and Decay**: \n   - If $ b > 1 $, the function represents exponential growth, meaning it increases rapidly as $ x $ increases.\n   - If $ 0 < b < 1 $, the function represents exponential decay, meaning it decreases rapidly as $ x $ increases.\n\n2. **Graph Characteristics**:\n   - The graph of an exponential function always passes through the point (0, 1), which is known as the initial value when $ a = 1 $.\n   - The domain of an exponential function is all real numbers, \( (-\infty, \infty) \).\n   - The range of an exponential function is all positive real numbers, \( (0, \infty) \).\n\n3. **End Behavior**:\n   - As $ x $ approaches positive infinity, \( f(x) \) approaches infinity if $ b > 1 $ (growth).\n   - As $ x $ approaches negative infinity, \( f(x) \) approaches 0, but never actually reaches it.\n\n4. **Intercepts**:\n   - The y-intercept occurs at \( (0, a) \).\n   - There are no x-intercepts since the function never touches the x-axis.\n\n5. **Transformations**:\n   - Exponential functions can be transformed through vertical and horizontal shifts, reflections, and stretches/compressions.\n\nThese properties make exponential functions particularly useful in various applications, including finance (e.g., compound interest), biology (e.g., population growth), and physics (e.g., radioactive decay).
