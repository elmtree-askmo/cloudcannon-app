    How do you determine the placement of the decimal point when multiplying two decimal numbers?
answer: >-
    To determine the placement of the decimal point when multiplying two decimal numbers, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the Total Decimal Places**: First, count the total number of decimal places in both of the numbers you are multiplying. For example, if you are multiplying 3.24 (which has 2 decimal places) and 1.2 (which has 1 decimal place), the total number of decimal places is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n2. **Multiply the Numbers as Whole Numbers**: Next, multiply the two numbers as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal points. For instance, if you multiply 324 and 12, you would perform the multiplication normally.\n\n3. **Place the Decimal Point**: After obtaining the product from the multiplication, you will need to place the decimal point in the result. The decimal point should be placed such that there are as many digits to the right of the decimal point in the final answer as the total number of decimal places counted in step 1. In our example, since we counted 3 decimal places, you would place the decimal point three places from the right in the product.\n\nFor example, if the product of 324 and 12 is 3888, you would place the decimal point to get 3.888.\n\nIn summary, the final answer will have the same number of decimal places as the total number of decimal places in the factors being multiplied. This method ensures that the decimal point is correctly positioned in the product.
