    The mean (arithmetic mean) of a data set can be calculated using the formula: \( \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \), which involves summing all values and dividing by the total number of observations.

    What is the formula for calculating the mean of a data set?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the mean (arithmetic mean) of a data set is given by:\n\n$$\n\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\bar{x}$ is the mean,\n- $x_i$ represents each value in the data set,\n- $n$ is the total number of observations in the data set,\n- $\sum$ denotes the summation of all values from $i=1$ to $n$.\n\nTo calculate the mean, you simply add together all the values in the data set and then divide by the number of values. For example, if you have a data set of values: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, the mean would be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Sum the values: $3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 72$.\n2. Count the number of values: $n = 9$.\n3. Divide the sum by the number of values: $\bar{x} = \frac{72}{9} = 8$.\n\nThus, the mean of this data set is 8.
