    What is the process for simplifying square roots, cube roots, and higher order roots?

    The process for simplifying square roots, cube roots, and higher order roots involves several key steps and techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### 1. Understanding Roots and Exponents\n- **Roots**: A root of a number is a value that, when raised to a certain power, gives that number. For example, the square root of $A$ is a number $B$ such that $B^2 = A$.\n- **Exponents**: Roots can also be expressed using fractional exponents. For instance, the square root of $A$ can be written as $A^{1/2}$, and the cube root as $A^{1/3}$.\n\n### 2. Simplifying Square Roots\nTo simplify square roots, follow these steps:\n- **Factor the Radicand**: Break down the number under the square root (the radicand) into its prime factors. For example, to simplify $\sqrt{72}$:\n  - Factor $72$ into $36 \times 2$ (where $36$ is a perfect square).\n  - Rewrite: $\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = \sqrt{36} \times \sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}$.\n\n- **Use Known Squares**: Recognize and use perfect squares (like $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, \ldots$) to simplify the expression.\n\n### 3. Simplifying Cube Roots and Higher Order Roots\nThe process is similar for cube roots and higher order roots:\n- **Factor the Radicand**: For example, to simplify $\sqrt[3]{54}$:\n  - Factor $54$ into $27 \times 2$ (where $27$ is a perfect cube).\n  - Rewrite: $\sqrt[3]{54} = \sqrt[3]{27 \times 2} = \sqrt[3]{27} \times \sqrt[3]{2} = 3\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n\n### 4. Combining Roots\nWhen adding or subtracting roots:\n- **Same Radicand**: Ensure that the radicands are the same. For example, $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$.\n- **Simplify First**: Always simplify each root before combining.\n\n### 5. Rationalizing Denominators\nWhen a root appears in the denominator, it is often necessary to rationalize it:\n- **Multiply by the Conjugate**: For example, to rationalize $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$:\n  - $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, simplifying roots involves factoring the radicand into perfect squares or cubes, using known values to simplify, and combining like terms when possible. Rationalizing denominators is also an important step when dealing with roots in fractions. By following these techniques, you can effectively simplify square roots, cube roots, and higher order roots.
