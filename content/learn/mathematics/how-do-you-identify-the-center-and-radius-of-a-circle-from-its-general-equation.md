    How do you identify the center and radius of a circle from its general equation?
answer: >-
    To identify the center and radius of a circle from its general equation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the General Equation**: The general form of the equation of a circle is given by:\n   $$\n   x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n   $$\n   where $D$, $E$, and $F$ are constants.\n\n2. **Calculate the Center**: The center \((h, k)\) of the circle can be determined using the formulas:\n   $$\n   h = -\frac{D}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad k = -\frac{E}{2}\n   $$\n\n3. **Calculate the Radius**: The radius $r$ can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   r = \sqrt{h^2 + k^2 - F}\n   $$\n\n### Example\nFor the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 8y + 13 = 0$:\n\n- Identify $D = 4$, $E = -8$, and $F = 13$.\n- Calculate the center:\n  $$\n  h = -\frac{4}{2} = -2, \quad k = -\frac{-8}{2} = 4\n  $$\n  Thus, the center is \((-2, 4)\).\n\n- Calculate the radius:\n  $$\n  r = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (4)^2 - 13} = \sqrt{4 + 16 - 13} = \sqrt{7}\n  $$\n\nTherefore, the center of the circle is \((-2, 4)\) and the radius is $\sqrt{7}$. \n\nThis method allows you to easily extract the center and radius from the general equation of a circle.
