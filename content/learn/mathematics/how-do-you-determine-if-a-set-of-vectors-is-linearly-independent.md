answer: >-
    To determine if a set of vectors is linearly independent, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Equation**: Consider a set of vectors $ \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \ldots, \mathbf{v_n} $. You need to check if the equation \n\n   $$\n   c_1 \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 \mathbf{v_2} + \ldots + c_n \mathbf{v_n} = \mathbf{0}\n   $$\n\n   has only the trivial solution, where $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n $ are scalars.\n\n2. **Form the Matrix**: Construct a matrix $ A $ where each column corresponds to one of the vectors in your set. For example, if you have vectors in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $:\n\n   $$\n   A = \begin{bmatrix}\n   | & | & & | \\\n   \mathbf{v_1} & \mathbf{v_2} & \ldots & \mathbf{v_n} \\\n   | & | & & |\n   \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n3. **Row Reduction**: Perform row reduction (Gaussian elimination) on the matrix $ A $ to bring it to its row echelon form or reduced row echelon form.\n\n4. **Check for Pivot Columns**: After row reduction, check the number of pivot columns (columns that contain leading 1s). If the number of pivot columns is equal to the number of vectors $ n $, then the vectors are linearly independent. If there are fewer pivot columns than vectors, then at least one vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, indicating linear dependence.\n\n5. **Alternative Method - Determinant**: If the vectors are in $ \mathbb{R}^n $ and you have $ n $ vectors, you can also compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors. If the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent. If it is zero, they are linearly dependent.\n\n### Example\nConsider the vectors \( \mathbf{v_1} = (1, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{v_2} = (0, 1) \) in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $:\n\n1. Set up the equation: \n   $$ c_1 (1, 0) + c_2 (0, 1) = (0, 0) $$\n\n2. Form the matrix:\n   $$\n   A = \begin{bmatrix}\n   1 & 0 \\\n   0 & 1\n   \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n3. Row reduction shows that this matrix is already in reduced row echelon form.\n\n4. There are 2 pivot columns (both columns), which equals the number of vectors (2), indicating that $ \mathbf{v_1} $ and $ \mathbf{v_2} $ are linearly independent.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively determine the linear independence of a set of vectors.
