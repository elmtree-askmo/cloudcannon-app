    What is the formula for calculating the volume of a right rectangular prism?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating the volume of a right rectangular prism is given by:\n\n$$\nV = l \times w \times h\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ V $ is the volume,\n- $ l $ is the length,\n- $ w $ is the width, and\n- $ h $ is the height of the prism.\n\nThis formula indicates that the volume is the product of the three dimensions of the prism. For example, if a right rectangular prism has a length of 6 units, a width of 8 units, and a height of 10 units, the volume can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nV = 6 \times 8 \times 10 = 480 \text{ cubic units}\n$$\n\nIt's important to ensure that all dimensions are in the same units before performing the calculation, as the resulting volume will be in cubic units (e.g., cubic inches, cubic meters).
