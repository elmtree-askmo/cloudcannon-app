    To add and subtract fractions, you can follow these basic steps, which vary depending on whether the fractions have the same or different denominators.\n\n### Adding and Subtracting Fractions with the Same Denominator\n1. **Identify the Denominator**: Ensure that both fractions have the same denominator.\n2. **Add or Subtract the Numerators**: If you are adding, sum the numerators. If you are subtracting, subtract the second numerator from the first.\n3. **Keep the Denominator**: The denominator remains the same in the result.\n4. **Simplify if Necessary**: If the resulting fraction can be simplified, do so.\n\n**Example**: \nFor $ \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} $:\n- Add the numerators: $ 2 + 3 = 5 $\n- Keep the denominator: $ \frac{5}{5} = 1 $\n\n### Adding and Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators\n1. **Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)**: Determine the smallest number that both denominators can divide into evenly.\n2. **Convert to Equivalent Fractions**: Rewrite each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the new denominator.\n3. **Add or Subtract the Numerators**: Once the fractions have the same denominator, proceed to add or subtract the numerators.\n4. **Keep the Denominator**: The denominator remains the same in the result.\n5. **Simplify if Necessary**: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\n**Example**: \nFor $ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} $:\n- The LCD of 4 and 6 is 12.\n- Convert: $ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} $ and $ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{12} $.\n- Add the numerators: $ 3 + 2 = 5 $.\n- Result: $ \frac{5}{12} $.\n\n### Adding and Subtracting Mixed Numbers\n1. **Convert to Improper Fractions**: If you are working with mixed numbers, convert them to improper fractions.\n2. **Follow the Steps Above**: Use the same steps as above for adding or subtracting fractions, whether they have the same or different denominators.\n3. **Convert Back if Necessary**: If the result is an improper fraction and you need a mixed number, convert it back.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively add and subtract fractions in various forms.
