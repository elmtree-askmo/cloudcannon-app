    What defines a square matrix and why is it important in matrix powers?
answer: >-
    A square matrix is defined as a matrix that has the same number of rows and columns, denoted as $ n \times n $. For example, a 2x2 square matrix can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSquare matrices are important in various mathematical contexts, particularly in linear algebra, for several reasons:\n\n1. **Determinants**: Only square matrices have determinants, which are scalar values that provide important information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible.\n\n2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Square matrices can have eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are fundamental in understanding linear transformations and systems of linear equations.\n\n3. **Matrix Powers**: The concept of matrix powers is applicable only to square matrices. If $ A $ is a square matrix and $ k $ is a positive integer, then $ A^k $ denotes the matrix $ A $ multiplied by itself $ k $ times. For example, if $ A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} $, then:\n\n$$\nA^2 = A \cdot A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1*1 + 2*3 & 1*2 + 2*4 \\ 3*1 + 4*3 & 3*2 + 4*4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & 10 \\ 15 & 22 \end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n4. **Linear Transformations**: Square matrices represent linear transformations in a way that preserves the dimensionality of the space, making them essential in various applications, including computer graphics and systems of equations.\n\nIn summary, square matrices are crucial in linear algebra due to their unique properties and the operations that can be performed on them, such as calculating powers, determinants, and eigenvalues.
