    What are the effects of horizontal compression and stretching on a graph?
answer: >-
    Horizontal compression and stretching are transformations that affect the width of a graph by altering the input variable (x-values) of a function. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:\n\n### Horizontal Compression\n- **Definition**: A horizontal compression occurs when the x-values of a function are multiplied by a factor greater than 1. This transformation effectively "squeezes" the graph towards the y-axis, making it narrower.\n- **Mathematical Representation**: If you have a function \( y = f(x) \), a horizontal compression can be represented as \( y = f(bx) \) where $ b > 1 $. For example, if \( f(x) = x^2 \), then \( f(2x) = (2x)^2 = 4x^2 \) compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\n### Horizontal Stretch\n- **Definition**: A horizontal stretch occurs when the x-values of a function are multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1. This transformation makes the graph wider, effectively "stretching" it away from the y-axis.\n- **Mathematical Representation**: This can be represented as \( y = f(bx) \) where $ 0 < b < 1 $. For instance, if \( f(x) = x^2 \), then \( f(0.5x) = (0.5x)^2 = 0.25x^2 \) stretches the graph horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\n### Summary of Effects\n- **Horizontal Compression**: Makes the graph narrower; points on the graph move closer to the y-axis.\n- **Horizontal Stretch**: Makes the graph wider; points on the graph move further away from the y-axis.\n\n### Visual Representation\nTo visualize these transformations, consider the parent function \( y = f(x) \). The transformations can be observed as follows:\n- For horizontal compression, the graph of \( y = f(2x) \) will appear more "squeezed" compared to \( y = f(x) \).\n- For horizontal stretching, the graph of \( y = f(0.5x) \) will appear more "stretched out" compared to \( y = f(x) \).\n\nUnderstanding these transformations is crucial for graphing functions accurately and interpreting their behavior under various modifications.
