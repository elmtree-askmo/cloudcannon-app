    How is integration used as the inverse of differentiation in algebraic functions?
answer: >-
    Integration is fundamentally linked to differentiation in calculus, serving as its inverse operation. This relationship is encapsulated in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which establishes that differentiation and integration are two sides of the same coin.\n\n### How Integration Works as the Inverse of Differentiation\n\n1. **Definition of Differentiation**: Differentiation involves calculating the derivative of a function, which represents the instantaneous rate of change of that function at a given point. For an algebraic function \( f(x) \), the derivative is denoted as \( f'(x) \). For example, if \( f(x) = x^2 \), then the derivative is:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 2x.\n   $$\n\n2. **Definition of Integration**: Integration, on the other hand, is the process of finding the integral of a function, which represents the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under the curve of the function over a specified interval. The integral of a function \( f(x) \) is denoted by \( \int f(x) \, dx \). For instance, the integral of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from 0 to 1 is calculated as:\n   $$\n   \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}.\n   $$\n\n3. **Inverse Relationship**: The key aspect of the inverse relationship is that if you differentiate a function and then integrate the result, you return to the original function (up to a constant). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \int f'(x) \, dx = f(x) + C,\n   $$\n   where $ C $ is the constant of integration. Conversely, if you integrate a function and then differentiate the result, you also return to the original function:\n   $$\n   \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int f(x) \, dx \right) = f(x).\n   $$\n\n4. **Application in Algebraic Functions**: For algebraic functions, the rules of differentiation (like the power rule) and integration (like the power rule for integrals) are straightforward. For example, if \( f(x) = ax^n \), then:\n   - The derivative is \( f'(x) = n \cdot ax^{n-1} \).\n   - The integral is $ \int ax^n \, dx = \frac{a}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C $ (for $ n \neq -1 $).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, integration serves as the inverse of differentiation by allowing us to recover the original function from its derivative, while also providing a means to calculate total changes over intervals. This interplay is crucial in solving various mathematical problems, particularly in the context of algebraic functions, where both differentiation and integration can be applied using established rules.
