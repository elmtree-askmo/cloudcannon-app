    Matrix and vector multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that allows us to apply linear transformations to vectors. Understanding the process and the importance of matrix dimensions is crucial for correctly performing these operations.\n\n### Matrix Dimensions\n\n1. **Definition**: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The dimensions of a matrix are denoted as $ m \times n $, where $ m $ is the number of rows and $ n $ is the number of columns.\n\n2. **Importance of Dimensions**: The dimensions of matrices dictate how they can be multiplied. Specifically, for two matrices $ A $ and $ B $:\n   - The number of columns in matrix $ A $ must equal the number of rows in matrix $ B $ for the multiplication $ AB $ to be defined.\n   - If $ A $ is of size $ m \times n $ and $ B $ is of size $ n \times p $, the resulting matrix $ C = AB $ will have dimensions $ m \times p $.\n\n### Process of Matrix and Vector Multiplication\n\n1. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: When multiplying a matrix $ A $ by a vector $ x $, the vector must have a compatible dimension. If $ A $ is an $ m \times n $ matrix, then $ x $ must be an $ n \times 1 $ column vector. The multiplication is performed as follows:\n   - Each entry of the resulting vector is computed as the dot product of the corresponding row of the matrix and the vector.\n\n   For example, if:\n   $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}, \quad x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} $$\n   The product $ Ax $ is calculated as:\n   $$\n   Ax = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 \\ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 \end{pmatrix}\n   $$\n\n2. **Matrix-Matrix Multiplication**: When multiplying two matrices $ A $ and $ B $, the process is similar but involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix with columns from the second matrix. If $ A $ is $ m \times n $ and $ B $ is $ n \times p $, the resulting matrix $ C = AB $ will have dimensions $ m \times p $.\n\n   The entry $ c_{ij} $ in the resulting matrix $ C $ is computed as:\n   $$\n   c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} b_{kj}\n   $$\n\n### Importance of Matrix Multiplication in Linear Transformations\n\nMatrix multiplication is essential for representing linear transformations. A linear transformation $ T $ can be expressed as:\n$$\nT(x) = Ax\n$$\nwhere $ A $ is the matrix representing the transformation and $ x $ is the vector being transformed. This relationship shows how matrix multiplication applies to transforming vectors in a vector space.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, understanding the process of matrix and vector multiplication, along with the importance of matrix dimensions, is crucial for effectively applying linear transformations and solving matrix equations. The ability to manipulate matrices and vectors is foundational in various applications, including computer graphics, engineering, and data science.
