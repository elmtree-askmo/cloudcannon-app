    Define an inner product and list its key properties.
answer: >-
    An **inner product** is a mathematical function that takes two vectors from a vector space and returns a scalar (a real or complex number). It is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and functional analysis, as it allows for the definition of geometric notions such as length (or norm) and angle between vectors.\n\n### Key Properties of Inner Products\n\n1. **Linearity**: The inner product is linear in its first argument. This means that for any vectors $ x, y, z $ and any scalars $ a, b $:\n   $$\n   \langle ax + by, z \rangle = a\langle x, z \rangle + b\langle y, z \rangle\n   $$\n\n2. **Conjugate Symmetry**: For any vectors $ x $ and $ y $, the inner product satisfies:\n   $$\n   \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}\n   $$\n   This means that the inner product of $ x $ and $ y $ is the complex conjugate of the inner product of $ y $ and $ x $.\n\n3. **Positive Definiteness**: For any vector $ x $, the inner product of $ x $ with itself is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if $ x $ is the zero vector:\n   $$\n   \langle x, x \rangle \geq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \langle x, x \rangle = 0 \iff x = 0\n   $$\n\nThese properties ensure that the inner product can be used to define norms and angles in vector spaces, facilitating the study of orthogonality and orthonormality among vectors. \n\nIn summary, the inner product is a crucial tool in understanding the structure of vector spaces, enabling various applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
