    Why is interval selection important when applying the rate of change formula to non-linear functions?
answer: >-
    Interval selection is crucial when applying the rate of change formula to non-linear functions due to the inherent variability in the slope of these functions across different intervals. Unlike linear functions, where the slope remains constant throughout the entire domain, non-linear functions exhibit changes in their rate of change depending on the specific points chosen for analysis.\n\n### Key Reasons for Importance of Interval Selection:\n\n1. **Variable Slope**: Non-linear functions, such as quadratic, exponential, and piecewise functions, have slopes that can change significantly over different intervals. For example, in a quadratic function like \(f(x) = x^2\), the average rate of change between two points can yield different results depending on the interval selected. If we calculate the average rate of change between $x = 1$ and $x = 3$ versus $x = 1$ and $x = 2$, we will find different average rates of change, reflecting the curvature of the graph.\n\n2. **Understanding Function Behavior**: By selecting different intervals, we can gain insights into the behavior of the function. For instance, analyzing shorter intervals may reveal more about the local behavior of the function, while longer intervals can provide a broader perspective on its overall trend. This is particularly important in applications such as optimization, where understanding how a function behaves over specific ranges can inform decision-making.\n\n3. **Approximation of Instantaneous Rate of Change**: The average rate of change over a small interval can serve as an approximation for the instantaneous rate of change at a point. As the interval shrinks, the average rate of change approaches the derivative of the function at that point. Therefore, careful selection of intervals can lead to more accurate approximations of the function's behavior at specific points.\n\n4. **Graph Interpretation**: When interpreting graphs of non-linear functions, the slope at various points can indicate different characteristics of the function, such as concavity and inflection points. By selecting appropriate intervals, one can better understand these features and how they relate to the overall shape of the graph.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, interval selection is vital when applying the rate of change formula to non-linear functions because it directly influences the calculated average rate of change, provides insights into the function's behavior, and aids in approximating instantaneous rates of change. Understanding how the slope varies across different intervals is essential for effective function analysis and mathematical modeling.
