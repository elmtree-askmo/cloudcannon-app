    What is the domain of a function, and how is it different from the range?
answer: >-
    The domain of a function refers to the complete set of possible values of the independent variable (often denoted as $ x $) that can be input into the function. In simpler terms, it represents all the values that $ x $ can take without causing any mathematical issues, such as division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.\n\nFor example, consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). The domain of this function includes all real numbers except $ x = 0 $, since division by zero is undefined. Therefore, we can express the domain in interval notation as \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \).\n\nOn the other hand, the range of a function is the complete set of possible values of the dependent variable (denoted as $ y $), which can be output from the function. Continuing with the same example, the range of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) is also all real numbers except $ y = 0 $, as the function never actually reaches zero. This can also be expressed in interval notation as \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \).\n\nIn summary, the key difference between the domain and the range is:\n- **Domain**: Set of all possible $ x $-values (inputs).\n- **Range**: Set of all possible $ y $-values (outputs).\n\nUnderstanding the domain and range is crucial for analyzing the behavior of functions and ensuring that inputs lead to valid outputs.
