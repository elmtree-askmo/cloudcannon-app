answer: >-
    The basic properties of square roots are essential for understanding how to manipulate and simplify expressions involving square roots. Here are the key properties and their applications to product and quotient rules:\n\n### Basic Properties of Square Roots\n\n1. **Non-negativity**: The square root of a non-negative number is always non-negative. For any $ x \geq 0 $:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{x} \geq 0\n   $$\n\n2. **Square Root of Zero**: The square root of zero is zero:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{0} = 0\n   $$\n\n3. **Product Rule**: The square root of a product of two non-negative numbers is equal to the product of their square roots:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{a \cdot b} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} \quad \text{for } a \geq 0, b \geq 0\n   $$\n\n4. **Quotient Rule**: The square root of a quotient of two non-negative numbers is equal to the quotient of their square roots:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} \quad \text{for } a \geq 0, b > 0\n   $$\n\n5. **Subadditive Property**: For any non-negative real numbers $ a $ and $ b $:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{a + b} \leq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\n   $$\n\n### Applications of Product and Quotient Rules\n\n- **Product Rule Application**: When simplifying expressions, you can use the product rule to combine square roots. For example, to simplify $ \sqrt{12} $:\n  $$\n  \sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}\n  $$\n\n- **Quotient Rule Application**: The quotient rule is particularly useful for rationalizing denominators. For example, to simplify $ \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}} $:\n  $$\n  \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{60}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{15}}{5}\n  $$\n\nThese properties and rules are fundamental in algebra for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and performing calculations involving square roots. Understanding these concepts allows for more efficient manipulation of mathematical expressions and aids in solving more complex problems.
