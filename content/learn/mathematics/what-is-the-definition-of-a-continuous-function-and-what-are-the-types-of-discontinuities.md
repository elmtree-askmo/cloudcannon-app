    What is the definition of a continuous function and what are the types of discontinuities?
answer: >-
    A continuous function is defined as a function that does not have any breaks, jumps, or holes in its graph. Formally, a function $ f $ is continuous at a point $ c $ if the following condition holds:\n\n$$\n\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)\n$$\n\nThis means that as $ x $ approaches $ c $, the value of \( f(x) \) approaches \( f(c) \). A classic example of a continuous function is \( f(x) = x^2 \), which is continuous everywhere on the real number line.\n\n### Types of Discontinuities\n\nDiscontinuities in functions can be classified into several types:\n\n1. **Point Discontinuity (Removable Discontinuity)**: This occurs when a function is not defined at a point, but the limit exists. For example, if \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \) for $ x \neq 1 $, the function has a removable discontinuity at $ x = 1 $ because the limit as $ x $ approaches 1 exists, but \( f(1) \) is not defined.\n\n2. **Jump Discontinuity**: This occurs when the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at a point exist but are not equal. For instance, the function defined as:\n   - \( f(x) = 1 \) for $ x < 0 $\n   - \( f(x) = 2 \) for $ x \geq 0 $\n   has a jump discontinuity at $ x = 0 $.\n\n3. **Infinite Discontinuity**: This occurs when the function approaches infinity (or negative infinity) as $ x $ approaches a certain value. An example is the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), which has an infinite discontinuity at $ x = 0 $.\n\n4. **Essential Discontinuity**: This type of discontinuity occurs when the limits do not exist at all. An example is the function \( f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \) as $ x $ approaches 0, where the function oscillates infinitely without settling at any value.\n\nUnderstanding these types of discontinuities is crucial in calculus, especially when analyzing the behavior of functions and their limits.
