    What is the value of the prefix 'kilo' in the metric system?
answer: >-
    The prefix 'kilo' in the metric system denotes a factor of one thousand, or $10^3$. This prefix is widely used in various measurements, such as:\n\n- **Kilometers (km)**: 1 kilometer equals 1,000 meters.\n- **Kilograms (kg)**: 1 kilogram equals 1,000 grams.\n- **Kiloliters (kL)**: 1 kiloliter equals 1,000 liters.\n\nThe use of the prefix kilo- simplifies the expression of large quantities, making it easier to communicate and perform calculations involving these measurements. Understanding this prefix is essential for converting between different metric units and for grasping the scale of measurements in the metric system.
