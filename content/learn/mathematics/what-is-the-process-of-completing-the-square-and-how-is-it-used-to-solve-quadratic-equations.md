    Completing the square is a method used to solve quadratic equations by transforming the equation into a perfect square trinomial. This technique is particularly useful when the quadratic equation is not easily factorable. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process for completing the square and how it is used to solve quadratic equations:\n\n### Steps to Complete the Square\n\n1. **Ensure the Coefficient of $x^2$ is 1**: If the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is not 1, divide the entire equation by that coefficient.\n\n2. **Rearrange the Equation**: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. For example, for the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, you would rewrite it as:\n   $$\n   ax^2 + bx = -c\n   $$\n\n3. **Add the Square of Half the Coefficient of $x$**: Take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (which is $b$), square it, and add it to both sides of the equation. This transforms the left side into a perfect square trinomial. The formula for this step is:\n   $$\n   \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n4. **Rewrite the Left Side as a Square**: The left side can now be factored as:\n   $$\n   (x + \frac{b}{2})^2\n   $$\n\n5. **Solve for $x$**: After rewriting the equation, use the square root property to solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   x + \frac{b}{2} = \pm \sqrt{\text{(right side)}}\n   $$\n   Finally, isolate $x$ to find the solutions.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$ using completing the square:\n\n1. **Rearrange**: Move the constant to the other side:\n   $$\n   x^2 + 6x = -5\n   $$\n\n2. **Add the Square of Half the Coefficient of $x$**: Half of 6 is 3, and squaring it gives 9. Add 9 to both sides:\n   $$\n   x^2 + 6x + 9 = 4\n   $$\n\n3. **Rewrite as a Square**: The left side factors to:\n   $$\n   (x + 3)^2 = 4\n   $$\n\n4. **Solve for $x$**: Apply the square root property:\n   $$\n   x + 3 = \pm 2\n   $$\n   This gives two equations:\n   $$\n   x + 3 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -2\n   $$\n   Solving these yields:\n   $$\n   x = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -5\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCompleting the square is a powerful method for solving quadratic equations, especially when factoring is not straightforward. It also leads to the derivation of the quadratic formula, which is given by:\n$$\nx = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nThis formula can be used to find the roots of any quadratic equation, providing a reliable alternative to completing the square or factoring.
