    How do you handle the decimal point when multiplying decimals with whole numbers?
answer: >-
    When multiplying decimals with whole numbers, the process involves a few straightforward steps to ensure the correct placement of the decimal point in the final product. Hereâ€™s how to handle the decimal point effectively:\n\n1. **Ignore the Decimal Point**: Start by treating the decimal number as if it were a whole number. This means you temporarily ignore the decimal point to simplify the multiplication process.\n\n2. **Multiply Normally**: Perform the multiplication as you would with whole numbers. For example, if you are multiplying 3.6 by 4, you would calculate it as if you were multiplying 36 by 4.\n\n3. **Count Decimal Places**: After completing the multiplication, count the total number of decimal places in the original decimal number. In the case of 3.6, there is one decimal place.\n\n4. **Reinsert the Decimal Point**: Place the decimal point in the product so that it has the same number of decimal places as the total counted in the previous step. For example, if the product of 36 and 4 is 144, you would place the decimal point to get 14.4 (since there was one decimal place in 3.6).\n\n### Example\nLet's say you want to multiply 4.52 by 3:\n- Ignore the decimal: Multiply 452 by 3 to get 1356.\n- Count the decimal places: 4.52 has two decimal places.\n- Place the decimal: The final answer is 13.56.\n\n### Summary\nThe key steps are to ignore the decimal point during multiplication, perform the multiplication, count the decimal places, and then place the decimal point back in the product accordingly. This method ensures accuracy in your calculations when dealing with decimals and whole numbers.
