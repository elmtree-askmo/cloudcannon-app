    The power rule in derivatives is a fundamental principle used for differentiating functions of the form f(x) = x^n, stating that the derivative is given by d/dx x^n = n x^(n-1). This rule simplifies the process of finding derivatives for polynomial functions.

answer: >-
    The power rule in derivatives is a fundamental principle used to differentiate functions of the form \( f(x) = x^n \), where $ n $ is any real number. The power rule states that:\n\n$$\n\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}\n$$\n\nThis means that to find the derivative of $ x^n $, you multiply by the exponent $ n $ and then decrease the exponent by 1.\n\n### Application of the Power Rule\n\nTo apply the power rule, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the function**: Determine if the function is in the form \( f(x) = x^n \).\n2. **Differentiate**: Use the power rule to find the derivative.\n3. **Simplify**: If necessary, simplify the resulting expression.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's consider the function \( f(x) = x^3 \).\n\n1. **Identify the function**: Here, $ n = 3 $.\n2. **Differentiate**: Applying the power rule:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 3 x^{3-1} = 3 x^2\n   $$\n3. **Result**: The derivative of \( f(x) = x^3 \) is \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \).\n\n### Additional Example\n\nFor a more complex function, such as \( f(x) = 5x^4 - 2x^2 + 7 \):\n\n1. Differentiate each term using the power rule:\n   - The derivative of $ 5x^4 $ is $ 20x^3 $ (since $ 4 \times 5 = 20 $ and $ 4 - 1 = 3 $).\n   - The derivative of $ -2x^2 $ is $ -4x $ (since $ 2 \times -2 = -4 $ and $ 2 - 1 = 1 $).\n   - The derivative of the constant $ 7 $ is $ 0 $.\n\n2. Combine the results:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 20x^3 - 4x\n   $$\n\nIn summary, the power rule is a straightforward and powerful tool for finding derivatives of polynomial functions, making it essential for calculus and mathematical analysis.
