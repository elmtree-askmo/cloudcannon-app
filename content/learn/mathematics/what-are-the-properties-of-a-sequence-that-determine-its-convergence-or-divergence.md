    What are the properties of a sequence that determine its convergence or divergence?
answer: >-
    The convergence or divergence of a sequence is determined by several key properties. Here are the main properties that influence whether a sequence converges:\n\n1. **Boundedness**: A sequence must be bounded to converge. This means there exists a real number $ M $ such that for all terms $ a_n $ in the sequence, $ |a_n| \leq M $. If a sequence is unbounded, it cannot converge.\n\n2. **Monotonicity**: A sequence that is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing can converge. Specifically:\n   - A monotonically increasing sequence satisfies $ a_{n+1} \geq a_n $ for all $ n $.\n   - A monotonically decreasing sequence satisfies $ a_{n+1} \leq a_n $ for all $ n $.\n   If a sequence is both bounded and monotonic, it will converge.\n\n3. **Limit Existence**: For a sequence $ a_n $ to converge to a limit $ L $, it must approach $ L $ as $ n $ approaches infinity. Formally, this means that for every $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists a natural number $ N $ such that for all $ n > N $, $ |a_n - L| < \epsilon $. This indicates that the terms of the sequence can be made arbitrarily close to $ L $ by taking sufficiently large $ n $.\n\n4. **Cauchy Criterion**: A sequence converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. This means that for every $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists a natural number $ N $ such that for all $ m, n > N $, $ |a_m - a_n| < \epsilon $. This criterion is particularly useful in metric spaces and provides a way to determine convergence without needing to know the limit.\n\n5. **Linear Recurrence Relations**: For sequences defined by linear recurrence relations, specific conditions on the coefficients can determine convergence. For example, if a sequence is defined by $ u_{n+1} = au_n + b $ with $ -1 < a < 1 $, the sequence will converge to a limit as $ n \to \infty $.\n\nIn summary, for a sequence to converge, it must be bounded, potentially monotonic, and must approach a specific limit as the index increases. Additionally, sequences defined by linear recurrence relations can converge under certain conditions on their parameters.
