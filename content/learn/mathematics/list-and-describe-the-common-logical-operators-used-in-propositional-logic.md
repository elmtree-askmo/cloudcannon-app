    List and describe the common logical operators used in propositional logic.

    In propositional logic, several common logical operators are used to form compound propositions from atomic propositions. Here are the primary logical operators along with their descriptions:\n\n1. **Negation (¬)**:\n   - The negation operator takes a single proposition and reverses its truth value. If a proposition $ P $ is true, then $ ¬P $ (not $ P $) is false, and vice versa.\n   - Example: If $ P $ represents "It is raining," then $ ¬P $ represents "It is not raining."\n\n2. **Conjunction (∧)**:\n   - The conjunction operator combines two propositions and is true only if both propositions are true. It is often represented by the symbol $ \land $.\n   - Example: If $ P $ is "It is raining" and $ Q $ is "It is cold," then $ P ∧ Q $ means "It is raining and it is cold."\n\n3. **Disjunction (∨)**:\n   - The disjunction operator combines two propositions and is true if at least one of the propositions is true. It is represented by the symbol $ \lor $.\n   - Example: For $ P $ as "It is raining" and $ Q $ as "It is sunny," $ P ∨ Q $ means "It is raining or it is sunny."\n\n4. **Exclusive-or (⊕)**:\n   - The exclusive-or operator is true if exactly one of the propositions is true, but not both. It is represented by the symbol $ \oplus $.\n   - Example: If $ P $ is "I will go to the party" and $ Q $ is "I will stay home," then $ P ⊕ Q $ means "I will either go to the party or stay home, but not both."\n\n5. **Implication (→)**:\n   - The implication operator indicates that if the first proposition (antecedent) is true, then the second proposition (consequent) must also be true. It is represented by the symbol $ \rightarrow $.\n   - Example: If $ P $ is "It is raining" and $ Q $ is "The ground is wet," then $ P → Q $ means "If it is raining, then the ground is wet."\n\n6. **Bi-implication (↔)**:\n   - The bi-implication operator indicates that both propositions are equivalent; that is, both are true or both are false. It is represented by the symbol $ \leftrightarrow $.\n   - Example: If $ P $ is "You will pass the exam" and $ Q $ is "You studied," then $ P ↔ Q $ means "You will pass the exam if and only if you studied."\n\nThese logical operators are fundamental in constructing logical expressions and understanding the relationships between different propositions in propositional logic. They help in forming truth tables, determining logical equivalencies, and resolving logical statements.
