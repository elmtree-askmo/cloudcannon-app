    How do you use row operations to solve a matrix equation?
answer: >-
    To solve a matrix equation using row operations, you typically follow a systematic approach that involves transforming the augmented matrix of the system into either Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Augmented Matrix\nStart by converting the system of linear equations into an augmented matrix. For a system of equations of the form:\n\n$$\n\begin{align*}\na_1x + b_1y + c_1z &= d_1 \\\na_2x + b_2y + c_2z &= d_2 \\\na_3x + b_3y + c_3z &= d_3\n\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding augmented matrix is:\n\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\na_1 & b_1 & c_1 & | & d_1 \\\na_2 & b_2 & c_2 & | & d_2 \\\na_3 & b_3 & c_3 & | & d_3\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Apply Elementary Row Operations\nUse elementary row operations to simplify the augmented matrix. The three types of row operations are:\n\n1. **Row swapping**: Interchanging two rows.\n2. **Row scaling**: Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.\n3. **Row addition**: Adding or subtracting a multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe goal is to manipulate the matrix into REF or RREF.\n\n### Step 3: Achieve Row Echelon Form (REF)\nIn REF, the following conditions must be satisfied:\n- All non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros.\n- The leading entry (pivot) of each non-zero row is to the right of the leading entry of the previous row.\n- All entries in a column below a pivot are zeros.\n\n### Step 4: Achieve Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)\nTo convert the matrix into RREF, ensure that:\n- The leading entry in each non-zero row is 1 (this is called a leading 1).\n- Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column.\n\n### Step 5: Identify Solutions\nOnce the matrix is in RREF, you can easily identify the solutions:\n- If there is a row that corresponds to an equation of the form $0 = k$ (where $k$ is a non-zero constant), the system is inconsistent and has no solution.\n- If there are free variables (columns without pivots), the system has infinitely many solutions, which can be expressed in parametric vector form.\n- If every variable is a basic variable (there are no free variables), the system has a unique solution.\n\n### Example\nConsider the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 5 \\\n4x + 6y &= 10 \\\nx - y &= 1\n\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & | & 5 \\\n4 & 6 & | & 10 \\\n1 & -1 & | & 1\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nUsing row operations, you can simplify this matrix to RREF, leading to a clearer understanding of the solution set.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps and applying row operations effectively, you can solve matrix equations and determine the nature of the solutions (unique, infinitely many, or no solution). Mastery of these techniques is essential for working with linear systems in linear algebra.
