    The variance of the sum of a constant and a random variable is equal to the variance of the random variable itself. Adding a constant does not affect the variability.

    What is the formula for the variance of a sum of a constant and a random variable?
answer: >-
    The formula for the variance of a sum of a constant and a random variable is straightforward. If you have a random variable $X$ and a constant $a$, the variance of the sum $a + X$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\mathrm{Var}(a + X) = \mathrm{Var}(X)\n$$\n\nThis is because the variance of a constant is zero, and adding a constant does not affect the variability of the random variable. Therefore, the variance remains the same as that of the random variable $X$.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n- The variance of a constant is zero.\n- Adding a constant to a random variable does not change its variance. \n\nThus, the variance of $a + X$ is simply the variance of $X$.
