    How do you multiply a monomial with a polynomial?
answer: >-
    To multiply a monomial by a polynomial, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Monomial and Polynomial**: A monomial is a single term that consists of a coefficient and a variable (e.g., $3x$), while a polynomial is a sum of multiple terms (e.g., $2x^2 + 4x - 5$).\n\n2. **Apply the Distributive Property**: Multiply the monomial by each term in the polynomial individually. This means you will distribute the monomial across all terms of the polynomial.\n\n3. **Multiply Coefficients and Variables**: For each term in the polynomial, multiply the coefficient of the monomial with the coefficient of the polynomial term, and then multiply the variables together. If the variables are the same, you can add their exponents.\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms**: After performing the multiplication for each term, combine any like terms if necessary.\n\n### Example\nLet's multiply the monomial $5x$ by the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x - 4$:\n\n1. **Distribute**:\n   - $5x \cdot 3x^2 = 15x^3$\n   - $5x \cdot 2x = 10x^2$\n   - \(5x \cdot (-4) = -20x\)\n\n2. **Combine the results**:\n   - The resulting polynomial is $15x^3 + 10x^2 - 20x$.\n\nThus, the product of the monomial $5x$ and the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x - 4$ is $15x^3 + 10x^2 - 20x$.\n\nThis method can be applied to any monomial and polynomial multiplication, ensuring that you carefully multiply each term and simplify as needed.
