    How do transformations affect the positions of vertices in a figure?
answer: >-
    Transformations significantly affect the positions of vertices in a geometric figure by altering their coordinates based on the type of transformation applied. Here are the main types of transformations and their effects on the positions of vertices:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation moves every point of a figure a certain distance in a specified direction without changing its shape or orientation. For example, if a vertex at coordinates \((x, y)\) is translated by a vector \((a, b)\), the new position of the vertex will be \((x + a, y + b)\).\n\n2. **Reflection**: A reflection flips a figure over a line (the line of reflection). For instance, if a vertex is reflected over the y-axis, the x-coordinate changes sign, resulting in a new position of \((-x, y)\). The orientation of the figure is reversed, but the shape remains congruent.\n\n3. **Rotation**: This transformation turns a figure around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation. The new position of a vertex after a rotation depends on the angle of rotation and the coordinates of the center. For example, rotating a point \((x, y)\) by an angle $\theta$ around the origin can be calculated using the formulas:\n   $$\n   x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\\n   y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)\n   $$\n   The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged, but the orientation may change.\n\n4. **Dilation**: This transformation changes the size of a figure while maintaining its shape. A vertex at \((x, y)\) dilated from a center point \((c_x, c_y)\) by a scale factor $k$ will have its new coordinates calculated as:\n   $$\n   x' = c_x + k(x - c_x) \\\n   y' = c_y + k(y - c_y)\n   $$\n   Depending on the scale factor, the figure can be enlarged (if $k > 1$) or reduced (if $0 < k < 1$).\n\n5. **Shear**: This transformation shifts one part of a figure in a specific direction while keeping the other part fixed. The effect on the vertices depends on the shear factor and the direction of the shear.\n\nIn summary, transformations can be combined to create complex movements and changes in figures, affecting the positions of vertices in a systematic way. Understanding these transformations is crucial in various fields, including geometry, physics, and computer graphics, as they help model and analyze the movement and alteration of shapes in space.
