    The x-intercept is where a graph crosses the x-axis (y=0), while the y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis (x=0). Understanding these intercepts is crucial for graphing functions and analyzing equations.

    What is the difference between an x-intercept and a y-intercept on a graph?
answer: >-
    The difference between an x-intercept and a y-intercept on a graph is primarily based on the values of the coordinates at which the graph intersects the respective axes.\n\n1. **X-Intercept**:\n   - The x-intercept is the point on the graph where the value of $ y $ is zero. This means that at the x-intercept, the graph crosses the x-axis.\n   - To find the x-intercept(s) of a function, you set $ y = 0 $ in the equation and solve for $ x $. The resulting values of $ x $ will give you the x-intercept(s), which can be expressed as points in the form \( (x, 0) \).\n\n   **Example**: For the equation $ y = 3x - 1 $:\n   - Set $ y = 0 $:\n     $$\n     0 = 3x - 1 \\\n     3x = 1 \\\n     x = \frac{1}{3}\n     $$\n   - Thus, the x-intercept is \( \left(\frac{1}{3}, 0\right) \).\n\n2. **Y-Intercept**:\n   - The y-intercept is the point on the graph where the value of $ x $ is zero. This means that at the y-intercept, the graph crosses the y-axis.\n   - To find the y-intercept(s), you set $ x = 0 $ in the equation and solve for $ y $. The resulting values of $ y $ will give you the y-intercept(s), which can be expressed as points in the form \( (0, y) \).\n\n   **Example**: For the same equation $ y = 3x - 1 $:\n   - Set $ x = 0 $:\n     $$\n     y = 3(0) - 1 = -1\n     $$\n   - Thus, the y-intercept is \( (0, -1) \).\n\n### Summary:\n- **X-Intercept**: Found by setting $ y = 0 $ and solving for $ x $. It indicates where the graph crosses the x-axis.\n- **Y-Intercept**: Found by setting $ x = 0 $ and solving for $ y $. It indicates where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n\nThese intercepts are essential for graphing functions, as they provide key points that help define the shape and position of the graph on the Cartesian plane.
