    How do you plot a point with coordinates (3, -2) on the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    To plot the point with coordinates (3, -2) on the coordinate plane, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start at the Origin**: Begin at the origin, which is the point (0, 0) where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.\n\n2. **Move Along the X-Axis**: Since the x-coordinate is 3, move 3 units to the right along the x-axis. This is because positive x-coordinates indicate movement to the right.\n\n3. **Move Along the Y-Axis**: Next, look at the y-coordinate, which is -2. From the point you reached after moving along the x-axis, move 2 units down along the y-axis. Negative y-coordinates indicate movement downward.\n\n4. **Mark the Point**: After moving to the position (3, -2), draw a point and label it accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the steps to plot the point (3, -2) are:\n- Start at (0, 0).\n- Move right 3 units to (3, 0).\n- Move down 2 units to (3, -2).\n- Mark and label the point.\n\nThis process utilizes the understanding of the coordinate plane, where the x-axis runs horizontally and the y-axis runs vertically.
