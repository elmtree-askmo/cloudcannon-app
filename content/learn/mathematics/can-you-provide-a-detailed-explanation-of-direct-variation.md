answer: >-
    Direct variation, also known as direct proportion, is a mathematical relationship between two variables, typically denoted as $x$ and $y$, where the ratio of the two variables remains constant. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:\n\n$$\ny = kx\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is a nonzero constant known as the constant of variation. In this context, we say that $y$ varies directly with $x$.\n\n### Characteristics of Direct Variation\n\n1. **Proportional Relationship**: In direct variation, if one variable increases, the other variable also increases proportionally. Conversely, if one variable decreases, the other variable decreases as well. This means that the ratio $ \frac{y}{x} $ is constant.\n\n2. **Linear Equation**: The equation $y = kx$ represents a straight line that passes through the origin (0,0) when graphed. The slope of this line is equal to the constant $k$.\n\n3. **Examples**:\n   - If $y = 6$ when $x = 2$, we can find the constant of variation $k$ as follows:\n     $$\n     k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\n     $$\n     Thus, the direct variation equation is $y = 3x$.\n   - Another example is if 12 workers can make 80 baskets in a day, we can set up a direct variation relationship to find how many workers are needed to make 100 baskets. If $w$ represents the number of workers and $b$ represents the number of baskets, we have:\n     $$\n     \frac{w_1}{b_1} = \frac{w_2}{b_2}\n     $$\n     where $w_1 = 12$, $b_1 = 80$, $b_2 = 100$, and we need to find $w_2$.\n\n### Practical Applications\n\nDirect variation is used in various fields, including physics, economics, and engineering, to describe relationships where changes in one quantity lead to proportional changes in another. For instance, the circumference $C$ of a circle varies directly with its diameter $d$, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nC = k \cdot d\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is a constant (specifically, $k = \pi$ for circles).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding direct variation is crucial for solving problems involving proportional relationships in mathematics. It provides a foundation for more complex mathematical concepts and is essential for preparing for final exams in mathematics.
