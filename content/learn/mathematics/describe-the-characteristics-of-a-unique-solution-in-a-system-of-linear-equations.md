    Describe the characteristics of a unique solution in a system of linear equations.
answer: >-
    A unique solution in a system of linear equations is characterized by several key features:\n\n1. **Existence of a Single Solution**: A unique solution means that there is exactly one set of values for the variables that satisfies all the equations in the system. This can be mathematically represented as a point in the solution space.\n\n2. **Geometric Interpretation**: Geometrically, a unique solution corresponds to the point of intersection of two or more lines (or planes in higher dimensions). For example, in a two-dimensional space, if you have two linear equations, they will intersect at a single point, which represents the unique solution.\n\n3. **Consistent and Independent System**: For a system to have a unique solution, it must be consistent (meaning there is at least one solution) and the equations must be independent. This implies that no equation can be derived from the others, ensuring that they represent distinct constraints on the variables.\n\n4. **Matrix Representation**: In terms of matrix algebra, if we represent the system of equations as $ A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} $, where $ A $ is the coefficient matrix, $ \mathbf{x} $ is the vector of variables, and $ \mathbf{b} $ is the constant vector, the system has a unique solution if:\n   - The matrix $ A $ has full rank, meaning the rank of $ A $ equals the number of variables (columns).\n   - The augmented matrix $ [A | \mathbf{b}] $ has the same rank as $ A $.\n\n5. **Example**: Consider the following system of equations:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   x + y &= 2 \\\n   2x - y &= 1\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n   This system has a unique solution, which can be found by solving the equations simultaneously. The lines represented by these equations intersect at a single point in the coordinate plane.\n\nIn summary, a unique solution in a system of linear equations is defined by the existence of exactly one solution, the geometric intersection of lines, the independence of the equations, and specific conditions in matrix representation.
