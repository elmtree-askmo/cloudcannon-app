    Define a proposition and provide an example.
answer: >-
    A proposition is a declarative statement that can be classified as either true (T) or false (F), but not both. Propositions are fundamental components in propositional logic, which studies the logical relationships between these statements and how they can be combined using logical connectives.\n\n### Example of a Proposition:\nConsider the statement: "The sky is blue." This statement is a proposition because it can be evaluated as either true or false depending on the conditions (e.g., during a clear day, it is true; during a storm, it may be false).\n\n### Additional Examples:\n1. "2 + 2 = 4" - This is a true proposition.\n2. "The Earth is flat" - This is a false proposition.\n3. "It is raining" - This is a proposition that can be true or false depending on the weather conditions.\n\nIn summary, propositions are essential in logic as they form the basis for constructing logical arguments and evaluating their truth values.
