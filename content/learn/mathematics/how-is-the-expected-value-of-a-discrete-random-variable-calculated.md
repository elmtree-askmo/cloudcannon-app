    How is the expected value of a discrete random variable calculated?
answer: >-
    The expected value of a discrete random variable is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics, representing the average outcome of a random variable over a large number of trials. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\nE(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \cdot P(x_i)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \( E(X) \) is the expected value of the random variable \( X \).\n- \( x_i \) represents each possible value of the discrete random variable.\n- \( P(x_i) \) is the probability of each corresponding value \( x_i \).\n- The summation runs over all possible values \( n \) of the random variable.\n\nTo compute the expected value, you multiply each value of the random variable by its probability and then sum all these products. This process effectively weighs each outcome by how likely it is to occur, providing a measure of the central tendency of the random variable.\n\n### Example Calculation\nFor instance, consider a game where you can win $100 with a probability of 0.05, win $0 with a probability of 0.50, and lose $20 with a probability of 0.45. The expected value can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nE(X) = (0.05 \cdot 100) + (0.50 \cdot 0) + (0.45 \cdot -20) = 5 + 0 - 9 = -4\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that, on average, you would expect to lose $4 if you played this game an infinite number of times.\n\n### Key Points\n- The expected value provides a long-term average outcome of a random variable.\n- It incorporates all possible outcomes and their probabilities, making it a comprehensive measure.\n- The sum of all probabilities in a probability distribution must equal 1, ensuring that the expected value is a valid calculation.\n\nUnderstanding the expected value is crucial for making informed decisions in various fields, including economics, finance, and risk assessment.
