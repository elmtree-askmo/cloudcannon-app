    What happens to a point's coordinates when it is reflected across the y-axis?
answer: >-
    When a point is reflected across the y-axis, its coordinates undergo a specific transformation. For a point $ P $ with coordinates \( (x, y) \), the reflection across the y-axis results in new coordinates $ P' $ given by:\n\n$$\nP' = (-x, y)\n$$\n\nThis means that the x-coordinate of the point is negated, while the y-coordinate remains unchanged. \n\n### Example:\nIf you have a point \( P(3, 5) \), after reflecting it across the y-axis, the new coordinates will be:\n\n$$\nP' = (-3, 5)\n$$\n\n### Summary:\n- **Original Point**: \( P(x, y) \)\n- **Reflected Point**: \( P'(-x, y) \)\n\nThis transformation is a type of rigid motion, meaning that the distance between points is preserved, and the shape and size of geometric figures remain unchanged. The orientation of the figure, however, may change depending on the axis of reflection. In this case, the orientation is flipped horizontally.
