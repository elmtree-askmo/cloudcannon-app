    What is meant by rigid motion in the context of reflections?
answer: >-
    In the context of reflections, **rigid motion** refers to transformations that preserve the shape and size of geometric figures. Specifically, rigid motions include translations, rotations, and reflections. When a figure undergoes a rigid motion, its position may change, but its dimensions and angles remain unchanged, meaning the figure retains its congruence with the original.\n\nFor reflections, this means that when a geometric figure is reflected across a line (the line of reflection), the resulting image is congruent to the original figure. The reflection effectively "flips" the figure over the line, creating a mirror image. The properties of rigid motion in reflections can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Preservation of Distance**: The distance between any two points in the original figure is the same as the distance between their corresponding points in the reflected image.\n\n2. **Congruence**: The original figure and its reflection are congruent, meaning they have the same shape and size.\n\n3. **Orientation Change**: While the shape and size remain unchanged, the orientation of the figure may be altered. For example, if the original figure is oriented in a certain direction, its reflection will be oriented in the opposite direction.\n\n4. **Coordinate Transformation**: In a coordinate system, reflecting a point across the x-axis changes its y-coordinate to its negative, while reflecting across the y-axis changes its x-coordinate to its negative. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   - Reflection across the x-axis: If a point is represented as $(x, y)$, its reflection is $(x, -y)$.\n   - Reflection across the y-axis: If a point is represented as $(x, y)$, its reflection is $(-x, y)$.\n\nIn summary, rigid motion in the context of reflections ensures that the geometric properties of figures are preserved, allowing for the analysis of symmetry and congruence in various applications, including geometry, physics, and computer graphics.
