    What defines a consistent system of linear equations?
answer: >-
    A consistent system of linear equations is defined as a system that has at least one solution. This can manifest in two forms: a unique solution or infinitely many solutions. \n\nTo elaborate, consider the following characteristics of a consistent system:\n\n1. **Existence of Solutions**: A consistent system must have at least one point of intersection among the equations represented. This means that the equations do not contradict each other and can be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n2. **Types of Solutions**:\n   - **Unique Solution**: This occurs when there is exactly one set of values for the variables that satisfies all equations in the system. For example, the system:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   x + y &= 1 \\\n   x - y &= 0\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n   has a unique solution at the point (0.5, 0.5).\n   - **Infinitely Many Solutions**: This situation arises when the equations are dependent, meaning they represent the same line or plane in geometric terms. For instance, the system:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   2x + 2y &= 2 \\\n   x + y &= 1\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n   has infinitely many solutions since the first equation is simply a multiple of the second.\n\n3. **Matrix Representation**: In terms of matrix representation, a system can be expressed as $ A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} $, where $ A $ is the coefficient matrix, $ \mathbf{x} $ is the vector of variables, and $ \mathbf{b} $ is the constant vector. For the system to be consistent:\n   - The rank of the augmented matrix $ [A | \mathbf{b}] $ must equal the rank of the coefficient matrix $ A $. This ensures that the equations are not contradictory.\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation**: Geometrically, a consistent system can be visualized as lines (in two dimensions) or planes (in three dimensions) that intersect at least at one point. If the lines or planes do not intersect at all, the system is inconsistent.\n\nIn summary, a consistent system of linear equations is characterized by the presence of at least one solution, which can either be unique or infinite, and is represented by the conditions of the equations being non-contradictory.
