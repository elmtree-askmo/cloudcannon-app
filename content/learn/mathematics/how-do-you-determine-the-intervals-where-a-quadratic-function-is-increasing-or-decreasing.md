    To determine the intervals where a quadratic function is increasing or decreasing, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Quadratic Function**: A quadratic function is typically in the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants.\n\n2. **Find the Vertex**: The vertex of the quadratic function can be found using the formula:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   This x-coordinate of the vertex is crucial because it represents the point where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.\n\n3. **Determine the Sign of $ a $**: The coefficient $ a $ indicates the direction of the parabola:\n   - If $ a > 0 $, the parabola opens upwards, and the function decreases on the interval \( (-\infty, x_v) \) and increases on the interval \( (x_v, \infty) \).\n   - If $ a < 0 $, the parabola opens downwards, and the function increases on the interval \( (-\infty, x_v) \) and decreases on the interval \( (x_v, \infty) \).\n\n4. **Calculate the Derivative**: To confirm the intervals of increase and decrease, you can also calculate the first derivative of the function:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 2ax + b\n   $$\n   Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n   $$\n   2ax + b = 0 \implies x = -\frac{b}{2a}\n   $$\n   This critical point will help you determine where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.\n\n5. **Test Intervals**: Choose test points in the intervals determined by the critical point:\n   - For $ x < -\frac{b}{2a} $, substitute a value into \( f'(x) \) to see if it is positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing).\n   - For $ x > -\frac{b}{2a} $, do the same.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the sign of the derivative in each interval, you can conclude where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\n### Example\nConsider the quadratic function \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1 \):\n- Here, $ a = 2 $, $ b = -4 $, and $ c = 1 $.\n- The vertex is at $ x = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 2} = 1 $.\n- Since $ a > 0 $, the function decreases on \( (-\infty, 1) \) and increases on \( (1, \infty) \).\n\nIn summary, the intervals of increase and decrease for a quadratic function can be determined by analyzing the vertex, the sign of the leading coefficient, and the first derivative.
