    How is division performed and what are its fundamental rules?
answer: >-
    Division is one of the four basic arithmetic operations, alongside addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It can be defined as the process of splitting a larger group into smaller, equal parts. The fundamental concept of division involves distributing a total quantity (the dividend) into a specified number of equal parts (the divisor), resulting in a quotient.\n\n### Fundamental Rules of Division\n\n1. **Division Formula**: The division can be expressed using the division algorithm, which states:\n   $$ \n   \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \n   $$\n   Here, the dividend is the number being divided, the divisor is the number by which the dividend is divided, the quotient is the result of the division, and the remainder is what is left over after division.\n\n2. **Inverse Operation**: Division is the inverse of multiplication. For example, if $ a = \frac{c}{b} $, then it can be rewritten as $ a \times b = c $, provided that $ b $ is not zero.\n\n3. **Non-Commutative**: Division is not commutative, meaning that $ a / b $ is not necessarily equal to $ b / a $. For instance, $ 10 / 2 = 5 $ is not the same as $ 2 / 10 = 0.2 $.\n\n4. **Non-Associative**: Division is also not associative. This means that the grouping of numbers affects the result. For example:\n   $$\n   (24 / 6) / 2 = 2 \quad \text{but} \quad 24 / (6 / 2) = 8\n   $$\n\n5. **Steps to Perform Division**: The process of performing division can be broken down into several steps:\n   - **Step 1**: Identify the dividend and divisor.\n   - **Step 2**: Multiply the divisor by a suitable number to get close to the dividend.\n   - **Step 3**: Subtract the result from the dividend.\n   - **Step 4**: Bring down the next digit (if applicable) and repeat the process until all digits have been processed.\n\n6. **Divisibility Rules**: There are specific rules that can help determine if one number is divisible by another without performing the actual division. For example, a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.\n\nUnderstanding these fundamental rules and concepts is essential for performing division accurately and effectively in various mathematical contexts.
