    What are confidence intervals and how are they calculated?
answer: >-
    A confidence interval (CI) is a statistical range that estimates where a population parameter, such as a mean or proportion, is likely to fall based on sample data. It provides a measure of uncertainty around a sample estimate, allowing researchers to make informed conclusions about the data. The confidence level, often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% or 99%), indicates the probability that the interval will contain the true population parameter.\n\n### Calculation of Confidence Intervals\n\nTo calculate a confidence interval for a population mean, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$)**: This is the average of your sample data.\n2. **Calculate the Standard Error (SE)**: The standard error is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\n   $$\n   where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size. If the population standard deviation is unknown, the sample standard deviation ($s$) can be used instead.\n\n3. **Find the Z-score (or t-score)**: Depending on the confidence level and whether the population standard deviation is known, you will use a Z-score (for large samples) or a t-score (for small samples). For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\n4. **Calculate the Margin of Error (ME)**: The margin of error is calculated as:\n   $$\n   ME = SE \times Z\n   $$\n   where $Z$ is the Z-score corresponding to your desired confidence level.\n\n5. **Determine the Confidence Interval**: Finally, the confidence interval is calculated using the following formulas:\n   - Lower Bound: $\bar{x} - ME$\n   - Upper Bound: $\bar{x} + ME$\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a sample mean of 100, a population standard deviation of 15, and a sample size of 36. To calculate a 95% confidence interval:\n\n1. **Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$)**: 100\n2. **Standard Error (SE)**:\n   $$\n   SE = \frac{15}{\sqrt{36}} = \frac{15}{6} = 2.5\n   $$\n3. **Z-score for 95% CI**: 1.96\n4. **Margin of Error (ME)**:\n   $$\n   ME = 2.5 \times 1.96 = 4.9\n   $$\n5. **Confidence Interval**:\n   - Lower Bound: $100 - 4.9 = 95.1$\n   - Upper Bound: $100 + 4.9 = 104.9$\n\nThus, the 95% confidence interval is (95.1, 104.9), meaning we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within this range.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nIt is important to note that a confidence interval does not imply that 95% of the sample data falls within the calculated range. Instead, it means that if we were to take many samples and construct confidence intervals for each, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\n\nConfidence intervals are widely used in various fields, including biology, business, finance, and polling, to provide estimates and assess the reliability of sample statistics.
