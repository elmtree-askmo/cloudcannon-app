    To graphically represent an absolute value function, you need to understand its unique characteristics and how to construct the graph step by step. Here’s a detailed guide on how to do this:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Absolute Value Function\n\nThe absolute value function is defined as:\n\n$$\ny = |x|\n$$\n\nThis function outputs the non-negative value of $ x $, meaning it reflects any negative input to its positive counterpart. For example, $ |-3| = 3 $ and $ |3| = 3 $. The graph of this function has a distinct 'V' shape.\n\n### 2. Key Characteristics of the Graph\n\n- **Vertex**: The vertex of the parent function $ y = |x| $ is at the origin (0,0). This point is the minimum of the graph since it opens upwards.\n- **Symmetry**: The graph is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that for every point \((x, y)\) on the graph, there is a corresponding point \((-x, y)\).\n- **Intercepts**: The graph intersects the y-axis at (0,0). It may or may not intersect the x-axis depending on transformations applied to the function.\n\n### 3. Constructing a Table of Values\n\nTo graph an absolute value function effectively, you can create a table of values. Here’s how:\n\n1. **Identify the Function**: Start with the function you want to graph, such as the parent function $ y = |x| $ or a transformed version like $ y = |x - 2| $.\n\n2. **Choose x-values**: Select a range of x-values that will help illustrate the shape of the graph. Include both negative and positive values, as well as zero. For example, you might choose:\n   - $ x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 $\n\n3. **Calculate Corresponding y-values**: For each x-value, calculate the y-value using the function. For $ y = |x| $:\n   - $ x = -2 $ → $ y = 2 $\n   - $ x = -1 $ → $ y = 1 $\n   - $ x = 0 $ → $ y = 0 $\n   - $ x = 1 $ → $ y = 1 $\n   - $ x = 2 $ → $ y = 2 $\n\n### 4. Plotting the Points\n\nUsing the table of values, plot the points on a coordinate plane:\n\n- Points to plot: (-2, 2), (-1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)\n\n### 5. Drawing the Graph\n\nConnect the plotted points with straight lines to form the 'V' shape of the graph. The graph will look like this:\n\n```\n   |\n  2|      *\n   |     * *\n  1|    *   *\n   |   *     *\n  0|--*-------*-------\n   | -2 -1  0  1  2\n```\n\n### 6. Transformations\n\nIf the function is transformed, such as $ y = |x - 2| $ or $ y = -|x| $, the vertex and shape will change accordingly:\n\n- **Horizontal Shift**: $ y = |x - h| $ shifts the graph horizontally by $ h $ units.\n- **Vertical Shift**: $ y = |x| + k $ shifts the graph vertically by $ k $ units.\n- **Reflection**: $ y = -|x| $ reflects the graph over the x-axis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you can graph any absolute value function accurately. Understanding the characteristics of the graph, constructing a table of values, and applying transformations will help you represent absolute value functions effectively.
