    How do horizontal and vertical shifts affect the graph of a function?
answer: >-
    Horizontal and vertical shifts are fundamental transformations that affect the graph of a function in specific ways.\n\n### Vertical Shifts\nA vertical shift occurs when a constant is added to or subtracted from the output of a function. This transformation affects the \(y\)-axis values of the graph. The general form for a vertical shift can be expressed as:\n\n- For a function \(y = f(x) + d\), where \(d\) is a positive constant, the graph shifts **up** by \(d\) units.\n- For a function \(y = f(x) - d\), where \(d\) is a positive constant, the graph shifts **down** by \(d\) units.\n\nThis means that every point on the graph of the function is moved vertically by the same amount, either up or down, depending on the sign of \(d\).\n\n### Horizontal Shifts\nA horizontal shift occurs when a constant is added to or subtracted from the input of a function. This transformation affects the \(x\)-axis values of the graph. The general form for a horizontal shift can be expressed as:\n\n- For a function \(y = f(x - c)\), where \(c\) is a positive constant, the graph shifts **right** by \(c\) units.\n- For a function \(y = f(x + c)\), where \(c\) is a positive constant, the graph shifts **left** by \(c\) units.\n\nIn this case, the entire graph moves horizontally, with each point being displaced left or right based on the value of \(c\).\n\n### Combining Shifts\nWhen both vertical and horizontal shifts are applied to a function, the graph will shift both up or down and left or right simultaneously. For example, if you have a function transformed as follows:\n\n$$\ny = f(x - c) + d\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the graph of \(f(x)\) is shifted right by \(c\) units and up by \(d\) units. Conversely, if \(d\) is negative, the graph shifts down, and if \(c\) is negative, the graph shifts left.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, vertical shifts affect the output values and move the graph up or down, while horizontal shifts affect the input values and move the graph left or right. Understanding these transformations is crucial for graphing functions and analyzing their behavior.
