    What distinguishes a reduced row echelon form from a row echelon form?
answer: >-
    The distinction between reduced row echelon form (RREF) and row echelon form (REF) lies in the additional constraints imposed on the leading entries and the structure of the matrix.\n\n### Row Echelon Form (REF)\nA matrix is in row echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1. All non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros.\n2. The leading entry (also known as a pivot) of each non-zero row is to the right of the leading entry of the previous row, creating a staircase pattern.\n3. All entries below each leading entry are zero.\n\nAn example of a matrix in row echelon form is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & -1 & 4 \\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 2\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)\nA matrix is in reduced row echelon form if it meets all the criteria of row echelon form, along with additional requirements:\n1. Each leading entry is 1.\n2. Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column, meaning all entries above and below each leading 1 must be zero.\n\nAn example of a matrix in reduced row echelon form is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Leading Entries:** In RREF, leading entries must be 1, while in REF, they can be any non-zero number.\n- **Column Entries:** In RREF, all entries in the column of a leading 1 must be zero except for the leading 1 itself. In REF, there are no restrictions on the entries above the leading entries.\n\nThese distinctions make RREF particularly useful for directly identifying solutions to systems of linear equations, as it provides a clearer representation of the relationships between variables.
