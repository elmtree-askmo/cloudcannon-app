    How do you reflect a point algebraically in terms of coordinate changes?
answer: >-
    To reflect a point algebraically in terms of coordinate changes, you need to know the line of reflection. The most common lines of reflection are the x-axis and y-axis. Hereâ€™s how to perform reflections across these axes:\n\n### Reflection Across the X-Axis\nWhen reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the x-axis, the y-coordinate changes sign while the x-coordinate remains the same. The transformation can be expressed as:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)\n$$\n**Example:** If you have a point \(P(2, 3)\), after reflecting it across the x-axis, the new point $P'$ will be:\n$$\nP'(2, -3)\n$$\n\n### Reflection Across the Y-Axis\nWhen reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the y-axis, the x-coordinate changes sign while the y-coordinate remains the same. The transformation can be expressed as:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, y)\n$$\n**Example:** If you have a point \(P(3, 4)\), after reflecting it across the y-axis, the new point $P'$ will be:\n$$\nP'(-3, 4)\n$$\n\n### Reflection Across the Origin\nWhen reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the origin, both coordinates change sign. The transformation can be expressed as:\n$$\n(x, y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n$$\n**Example:** If you have a point \(P(1, -2)\), after reflecting it across the origin, the new point $P'$ will be:\n$$\nP'(-1, 2)\n$$\n\n### General Reflection Across a Line\nFor reflections across a line that is not one of the axes, the algebraic representation can be more complex and typically involves finding the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of reflection and then determining the corresponding point on the opposite side of the line.\n\nIn summary, the algebraic changes in coordinates for reflections are straightforward when dealing with the x-axis, y-axis, or the origin. For other lines of reflection, the process involves more geometric considerations.
