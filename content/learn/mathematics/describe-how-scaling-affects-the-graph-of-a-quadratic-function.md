    Describe how scaling affects the graph of a quadratic function.
answer: >-
    Scaling a quadratic function affects the graph in several significant ways, primarily through vertical and horizontal transformations. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how scaling impacts the graph of a quadratic function:\n\n### 1. Vertical Scaling\nVertical scaling involves multiplying the function by a constant factor, which alters the height of the parabola. If we take a basic quadratic function in vertex form:\n\n$$\nf(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the coefficient that determines the vertical scaling:\n\n- **If $ |a| > 1 $**: The graph is vertically stretched. This means that the parabola becomes narrower, and the points on the graph move further away from the x-axis.\n- **If $ 0 < |a| < 1 $**: The graph is vertically compressed. The parabola becomes wider, and the points on the graph move closer to the x-axis.\n- **If $ a < 0 $**: The parabola opens downwards instead of upwards, and the same stretching or compressing effects apply.\n\nFor example, comparing \(f(x) = x^2\) and \(g(x) = 2x^2\):\n- The graph of \(g(x)\) will be narrower than that of \(f(x)\) because it is stretched vertically by a factor of 2.\n\n### 2. Horizontal Scaling\nHorizontal scaling is less common but can be achieved by manipulating the input variable $x$. This is done by changing the function to:\n\n$$\nf(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \quad \text{to} \quad f(x) = a\left(\frac{x}{b}\right)^2 + k\n$$\n\nwhere $b$ is a constant that affects the horizontal scaling:\n\n- **If $ |b| > 1 $**: The graph is horizontally compressed, making the parabola narrower.\n- **If $ 0 < |b| < 1 $**: The graph is horizontally stretched, making the parabola wider.\n\nFor instance, comparing \(f(x) = x^2\) and \(g(x) = (0.5x)^2\):\n- The graph of \(g(x)\) will be wider than that of \(f(x)\) because it is stretched horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\n### 3. Summary of Effects\n- **Vertical Scaling**: Changes the width and direction of the parabola based on the value of $a$.\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Alters the width of the parabola based on the value of $b$.\n\n### 4. Graphical Representation\nWhen graphing these transformations, it is essential to start with the parent function \(f(x) = x^2\) and apply the scaling factors to observe the changes visually. This can be done using graphing software or interactive tools that allow for real-time manipulation of the coefficients.\n\nIn conclusion, scaling a quadratic function significantly impacts its graph, affecting both its width and orientation. Understanding these transformations is crucial for analyzing and graphing quadratic functions effectively.
