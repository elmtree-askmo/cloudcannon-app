    What are the common operators used in regular expressions and their functions?
answer: >-
    Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used for searching, matching, and manipulating patterns within strings. They utilize a variety of special characters, each serving a specific function. Here are some of the most common operators used in regular expressions along with their functions:\n\n### Common Operators in Regular Expressions\n\n1. **Dot (`.`)**: \n   - Matches any single character except newline characters.\n   - Example: `a.b` matches `acb`, `a1b`, but not `ab` or `a\nb`.\n\n2. **Asterisk (`*`)**: \n   - Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n   - Example: `a*` matches `""` (empty string), `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc.\n\n3. **Plus (`+`)**: \n   - Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n   - Example: `a+` matches `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, but not `""`.\n\n4. **Question Mark (`?`)**: \n   - Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.\n   - Example: `a?` matches `""` or `a`.\n\n5. **Caret (`^`)**: \n   - Asserts the position at the start of a string.\n   - Example: `^abc` matches `abc` at the beginning of a string.\n\n6. **Dollar Sign (`$`)**: \n   - Asserts the position at the end of a string.\n   - Example: `abc$` matches `abc` at the end of a string.\n\n7. **Square Brackets (`[]`)**: \n   - Denotes a character class, allowing you to specify a set of characters to match.\n   - Example: `[abc]` matches `a`, `b`, or `c`.\n\n8. **Parentheses (`()`)**: \n   - Used to group parts of a regex and create capture groups, which allow you to extract specific parts of the matched text.\n   - Example: `(abc)+` matches `abc`, `abcabc`, etc.\n\n9. **Curly Braces (`{}`)**: \n   - Specifies the exact number of occurrences of the preceding element.\n   - Example: `a{2}` matches `aa`, while `a{2,4}` matches `aa`, `aaa`, or `aaaa`.\n\n10. **Backslash (`\`)**: \n    - Used to escape special characters, allowing you to match them literally.\n    - Example: `\.` matches a literal period.\n\n### Summary\nThese operators can be combined to create complex patterns for searching and manipulating text. Understanding how to use these special characters effectively is crucial for leveraging the full power of regular expressions in programming and text processing tasks. Regular expressions are widely used in various programming languages and tools for tasks such as validation, searching, and text manipulation.
