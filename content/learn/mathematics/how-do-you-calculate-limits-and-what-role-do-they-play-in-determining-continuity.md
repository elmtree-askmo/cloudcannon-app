    How do you calculate limits and what role do they play in determining continuity?
answer: >-
    To calculate limits, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Direct Substitution**: Start by substituting the value that $ x $ approaches into the function \( f(x) \). If \( f(c) \) is defined and finite, then:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)\n   $$\n\n2. **Factoring**: If direct substitution results in an indeterminate form (like $ \frac{0}{0} $), try factoring the expression to simplify it. For example, for the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \), you can factor the numerator:\n   $$\n   f(x) = \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1}\n   $$\n   After canceling \( (x - 1) \), you can substitute $ x = 1 $ into \( f(x) = x + 1 \), yielding:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = 2\n   $$\n\n3. **Rationalization**: For functions involving square roots, you can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate to eliminate the square root.\n\n4. **L'HÃ´pital's Rule**: If you encounter an indeterminate form like $ \frac{0}{0} $ or $ \frac{\infty}{\infty} $, you can differentiate the numerator and denominator separately and then take the limit again:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n   $$\n\n5. **One-Sided Limits**: Sometimes, it is useful to evaluate the limit from one side (left or right) to determine the behavior of the function as it approaches the point.\n\n### Role of Limits in Determining Continuity\n\nLimits play a crucial role in determining the continuity of a function at a point $ c $. A function \( f(x) \) is continuous at $ x = c $ if the following three conditions are met:\n\n1. **Defined at the Point**: \( f(c) \) must be defined.\n2. **Limit Exists**: The limit \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \) must exist.\n3. **Equality of Limit and Function Value**: The limit must equal the function value:\n   $$\n   \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)\n   $$\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the function is not continuous at that point. For example, in the case of the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \) at $ x = 1 $, the function is undefined at that point, even though the limit exists and equals 2. Therefore, \( f(x) \) is not continuous at $ x = 1 $.\n\nIn summary, limits are essential for understanding the behavior of functions near specific points and are foundational in defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals in calculus.
