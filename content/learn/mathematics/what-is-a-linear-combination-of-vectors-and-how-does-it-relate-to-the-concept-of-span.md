    What is a linear combination of vectors, and how does it relate to the concept of span?
answer: >-
    A **linear combination** of vectors is an expression formed by multiplying each vector by a scalar and then adding the results. Specifically, if you have a set of vectors $ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k $ and corresponding scalars $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k $, a linear combination can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Linear Combination} = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \ldots + c_kv_k.\n$$\n\n### Components of a Linear Combination\n\n1. **Vectors**: The vectors $ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k $ are the elements being combined. These vectors can exist in any vector space, such as $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, $ \mathbb{R}^3 $, or higher-dimensional spaces.\n\n2. **Scalars**: The scalars $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k $ are real numbers (or elements from any field) that multiply the corresponding vectors. These scalars can be positive, negative, or zero.\n\n### Relationship to Span\n\nThe concept of **span** is closely related to linear combinations. The span of a set of vectors $ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k $ is defined as the collection of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{span}(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) = \{c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \ldots + c_kv_k : c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k \in \mathbb{R}\}.\n$$\n\nThis means that any vector in the span can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the set, where $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k $ are scalars (real numbers).\n\n### Importance of Span\n\nThe span of a set of vectors forms a **subspace** of the vector space in which the vectors reside. A subspace must satisfy three key properties:\n\n1. It contains the zero vector.\n2. It is closed under vector addition (the sum of any two vectors in the subspace is also in the subspace).\n3. It is closed under scalar multiplication (multiplying any vector in the subspace by a scalar results in another vector in the subspace).\n\nUnderstanding the span is crucial for exploring more complex topics in linear algebra, such as linear independence, basis, and dimension. In summary, linear combinations are foundational in linear algebra, and the span of a set of vectors is the set of all linear combinations of those vectors, forming a subspace of the vector space.
