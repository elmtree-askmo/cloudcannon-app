    How do you identify basic and free variables in a system of equations?
answer: >-
    To identify basic and free variables in a system of equations, you typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Formulate the Augmented Matrix**: Start by writing the system of equations in augmented matrix form. This matrix includes the coefficients of the variables and the constants from the right-hand side of the equations.\n\n2. **Transform to Row Echelon Form (REF)**: Use elementary row operations (such as row swapping, scaling rows, and adding multiples of rows) to transform the augmented matrix into row echelon form. In REF, all non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros, and the leading coefficient (pivot) of a non-zero row is to the right of the leading coefficient of the previous row.\n\n3. **Identify Pivot Positions**: In the REF, look for the leading entries (the first non-zero number from the left in a non-zero row). These entries are called pivot positions. The columns that contain these pivot positions correspond to basic variables.\n\n4. **Determine Free Variables**: Any variable that does not correspond to a pivot column is considered a free variable. Free variables can take on any value, which allows for the expression of infinitely many solutions in the case of underdetermined systems.\n\n### Example\nConsider the following system of equations:\n1. $ x + 2y + 3z = 1 $\n2. $ 2y + 5z = 2 $\n3. $ z = 3 $\n\nThe augmented matrix for this system is:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & | & 1 \\\n0 & 2 & 5 & | & 2 \\\n0 & 0 & 1 & | & 3\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nAfter applying row operations, you can identify the pivot positions:\n- The first column (for $ x $) is a pivot column.\n- The second column (for $ y $) is a pivot column.\n- The third column (for $ z $) is also a pivot column.\n\nIn this case, all variables $ x, y, z $ are basic variables since there are no free variables. If there were any columns without pivots, those would correspond to free variables.\n\n### Summary\n- **Basic Variables**: Correspond to pivot columns in the REF.\n- **Free Variables**: Correspond to non-pivot columns, indicating that they can take arbitrary values.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between basic and free variables is crucial for solving linear systems and determining the nature of their solutions, whether unique, infinitely many, or no solution.
