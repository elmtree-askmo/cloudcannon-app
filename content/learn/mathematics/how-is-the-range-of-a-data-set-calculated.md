    How is the range of a data set calculated?
answer: >-
    The range of a data set is a simple measure of dispersion that quantifies the spread between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Range} = \text{Max} - \text{Min}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- **Max** is the highest value in the dataset.\n- **Min** is the lowest value in the dataset.\n\nFor example, if you have a dataset consisting of the values [3, 7, 2, 9, 5], the maximum value is 9 and the minimum value is 2. Therefore, the range would be calculated as:\n\n$$\n\text{Range} = 9 - 2 = 7\n$$\n\nThe range provides a quick sense of the variability in the data, but it is sensitive to outliers, as a single extreme value can significantly affect the range.
