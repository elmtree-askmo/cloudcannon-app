    How are the vertices of a triangle transformed during a geometric transformation?
answer: >-
    The transformation of the vertices of a triangle during a geometric transformation can occur through various types of transformations, including translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations. Each type of transformation affects the vertices in specific ways:\n\n1. **Translation**: This transformation involves shifting the entire triangle in a specific direction without altering its shape or orientation. If the vertices of a triangle are given by coordinates \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(x_2, y_2)\), and \(C(x_3, y_3)\), and the triangle is translated by a vector \((a, b)\), the new coordinates of the vertices will be:\n   - \(A'(x_1 + a, y_1 + b)\)\n   - \(B'(x_2 + a, y_2 + b)\)\n   - \(C'(x_3 + a, y_3 + b)\)\n\n2. **Rotation**: This transformation involves turning the triangle around a fixed point (the center of rotation) by a certain angle. For example, if a triangle is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the origin, the new coordinates of the vertices can be calculated using the rotation formulas:\n   - For a point \(P(x, y)\) rotated by an angle $\theta$:\n     - \(P'(x', y')\) where:\n     $$\n     x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta) \\\n     y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)\n     $$\n\n3. **Reflection**: This transformation creates a mirror image of the triangle across a specified line (e.g., the x-axis, y-axis, or any line). For example, reflecting a triangle across the y-axis will change the coordinates of the vertices as follows:\n   - \(A'(-x_1, y_1)\)\n   - \(B'(-x_2, y_2)\)\n   - \(C'(-x_3, y_3)\)\n\n4. **Dilation**: This transformation changes the size of the triangle while maintaining its shape. If a triangle is dilated from a center point \(O(x_0, y_0)\) by a scale factor $k$, the new coordinates of the vertices will be:\n   - \(A' = O + k(A - O)\)\n   - \(B' = O + k(B - O)\)\n   - \(C' = O + k(C - O)\)\n\n   In terms of coordinates, if \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(x_2, y_2)\), and \(C(x_3, y_3)\) are the original vertices, the new coordinates after dilation will be:\n   $$\n   A' = \left( x_0 + k(x_1 - x_0), y_0 + k(y_1 - y_0) \right) \\\n   B' = \left( x_0 + k(x_2 - x_0), y_0 + k(y_2 - y_0) \right) \\\n   C' = \left( x_0 + k(x_3 - x_0), y_0 + k(y_3 - y_0) \right)\n   $$\n\nIn summary, the transformation of the vertices of a triangle depends on the type of geometric transformation applied, and each transformation alters the coordinates of the vertices in a specific manner while preserving certain properties such as shape and orientation (in the case of translation and rotation).
