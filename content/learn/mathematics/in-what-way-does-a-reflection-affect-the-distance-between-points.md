    In what way does a reflection affect the distance between points?
answer: >-
    A reflection is a geometric transformation that flips a figure across a specific line, known as the line of reflection. One of the key properties of reflections is that they are classified as isometric transformations. This means that the distance between points is preserved during the reflection process.\n\nWhen a point \(P(x, y)\) is reflected over a line, the distance from the original point to the line of reflection is equal to the distance from the reflected point to the line. For example, if a point is reflected over the y-axis, its new coordinates will be \((-x, y)\). The distance from the original point to the y-axis remains the same as the distance from the reflected point to the y-axis.\n\nThis preservation of distance ensures that the original figure and its reflected image are congruent, meaning they have the same size and shape. Therefore, the reflection does not alter the distances between any two points in the figure; it merely changes their positions while maintaining the overall geometric properties.\n\nIn summary, a reflection affects the distance between points by preserving it, ensuring that the original figure and its reflection are congruent and maintain the same dimensions and shape.
