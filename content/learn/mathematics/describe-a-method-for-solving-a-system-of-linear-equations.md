    Describe a method for solving a system of linear equations.
answer: >-
    To solve a system of linear equations, several methods can be employed, with Gaussian elimination and Cramer's Rule being two of the most common techniques. Below, I will describe both methods in detail.\n\n### 1. Gaussian Elimination\n\nGaussian elimination is a systematic method for solving systems of linear equations. The process involves transforming the system into an equivalent upper triangular form, which makes it easier to solve for the variables through back substitution. Here are the steps involved:\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Form the Augmented Matrix**: Write the system of equations in matrix form, creating an augmented matrix that includes the coefficients and the constants.\n   \n   For example, for the system:\n   $$\n   \begin{align*}\n   2x + 3y &= 5 \\\n   4x + y &= 11\n   \end{align*}\n   $$\n   The augmented matrix is:\n   $$\n   \begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 3 & | & 5 \\\n   4 & 1 & | & 11\n   \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n2. **Row Operations**: Use a series of row operations to transform the matrix into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF). The operations include:\n   - Swapping two rows.\n   - Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.\n   - Adding or subtracting a multiple of one row from another row.\n\n3. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in upper triangular form, solve for the variables starting from the last row and moving upwards.\n\n#### Example:\nContinuing with the previous example, after applying Gaussian elimination, you might arrive at:\n$$\n\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \frac{3}{2} & | & \frac{5}{2} \\\n0 & 1 & | & 7\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this, you can back substitute to find the values of $ x $ and $ y $.\n\n### 2. Cramer's Rule\n\nCramer's Rule is applicable for solving a system of linear equations when the coefficient matrix is square and non-singular (i.e., it has a non-zero determinant). It expresses the solution in terms of determinants.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Set Up the System**: Write the system in the form $ Ax = b $, where $ A $ is the coefficient matrix, $ x $ is the vector of variables, and $ b $ is the vector of constants.\n\n2. **Calculate the Determinant**: Compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix $ A $, denoted as \( \text{det}(A) \).\n\n3. **Form New Matrices**: For each variable $ x_i $, create a new matrix $ A_i $ by replacing the $ i $-th column of $ A $ with the vector $ b $.\n\n4. **Apply Cramer’s Rule**: The solution for each variable $ x_i $ is given by:\n   $$\n   x_i = \frac{\text{det}(A_i)}{\text{det}(A)}\n   $$\n\n#### Example:\nFor the same system:\n$$\n\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 5 \\\n4x + y &= 11\n\end{align*}\n$$\nThe coefficient matrix $ A $ is:\n$$\nA = \begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\n4 & 1\n\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the determinants and applying Cramer’s Rule will yield the values of $ x $ and $ y $.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Gaussian elimination and Cramer's Rule are effective methods for solving systems of linear equations. Gaussian elimination is generally more versatile and can handle larger systems, while Cramer's Rule is straightforward but limited to systems where the number of equations equals the number of unknowns and the determinant is non-zero. Understanding these methods is crucial for applications in various fields, including engineering, physics, and computer science.
