    How are negative exponents used in expressing small numbers in scientific notation?
answer: >-
    Negative exponents are a fundamental aspect of scientific notation, particularly when expressing very small numbers. This notation allows for a more compact and manageable representation of values that would otherwise be cumbersome to write out in full.\n\n### Understanding Scientific Notation with Negative Exponents\n\nIn scientific notation, a number is expressed in the form:\n\n$$\nN = a \times 10^n\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ a $ is the coefficient, which is a number between 1 and 10 (i.e., $ 1 \leq a < 10 $),\n- $ n $ is a negative integer when representing small numbers.\n\n#### Example of Small Numbers\n\nFor example, the small number 0.000007568 can be expressed in scientific notation as:\n\n$$\n7.568 \times 10^{-6}\n$$\n\nIn this case, the negative exponent (-6) indicates that the decimal point in the coefficient (7.568) is moved six places to the left, resulting in the original small number.\n\n### Practical Applications\n\nUsing scientific notation with negative exponents is particularly beneficial in various scientific fields, such as physics, chemistry, and engineering, where measurements can often be extremely small. For instance, the size of atoms, the concentration of solutions, or the wavelength of light can all be expressed more conveniently using this notation. It simplifies calculations and makes it easier to compare and manipulate these values without dealing with numerous zeros.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, negative exponents in scientific notation provide a clear and efficient way to express and work with small numbers. This enhances clarity and precision in scientific communication, allowing for easier interpretation and manipulation of data.
