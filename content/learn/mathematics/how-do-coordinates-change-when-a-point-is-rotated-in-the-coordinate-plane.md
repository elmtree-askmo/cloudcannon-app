    How do coordinates change when a point is rotated in the coordinate plane?
answer: >-
    When a point is rotated in the coordinate plane, its coordinates change according to specific rotation rules based on the angle of rotation and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). The following outlines how to calculate the new coordinates of a point after rotation about the origin:\n\n1. **Rotation by 90 degrees**:\n   - **Counterclockwise**: The transformation rule is given by:\n     $$\n     (x, y) \rightarrow (-y, x)\n     $$\n   - **Clockwise**: The transformation rule is:\n     $$\n     (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n     $$\n\n2. **Rotation by 180 degrees**:\n   - The transformation is the same for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations:\n     $$\n     (x, y) \rightarrow (-x, -y)\n     $$\n\n3. **Rotation by 270 degrees**:\n   - **Counterclockwise**: The transformation rule is:\n     $$\n     (x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)\n     $$\n   - **Clockwise**: The transformation rule is:\n     $$\n     (x, y) \rightarrow (-y, x)\n     $$\n\n### Example Calculation\nTo illustrate, let's consider rotating the point \( (3, 4) \) by 90 degrees clockwise:\n- Using the clockwise rotation rule:\n  $$\n  (3, 4) \rightarrow (4, -3)\n  $$\nThus, the new coordinates after a 90-degree clockwise rotation are \( (4, -3) \).\n\n### General Formula for Rotation\nFor a rotation by an angle $ \theta $ (in radians) about the origin, the new coordinates \( (x', y') \) can be calculated using the following formulas:\n$$\nx' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta)\n$$\n$$\ny' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)\n$$\n\n### Summary\nThe coordinates of a point change based on the angle and direction of rotation. The transformation rules for common angles (90°, 180°, and 270°) provide a straightforward way to determine the new coordinates after rotation.
