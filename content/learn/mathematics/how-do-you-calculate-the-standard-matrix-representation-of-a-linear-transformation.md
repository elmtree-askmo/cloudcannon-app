    To calculate the standard matrix representation of a linear transformation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Linear Transformation**: Let $ T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m $ be the linear transformation you want to represent with a matrix.\n\n2. **Determine the Standard Basis**: The standard basis for $ \mathbb{R}^n $ consists of the vectors $ \vec{e_1}, \vec{e_2}, \ldots, \vec{e_n} $, where each $ \vec{e_i} $ has a 1 in the $ i $-th position and 0s elsewhere. For example, in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $, the standard basis vectors are:\n   - $ \vec{e_1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $\n   - $ \vec{e_2} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $\n   - $ \vec{e_3} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation**: Compute the image of each standard basis vector under the transformation $ T $:\n   - \( T(\vec{e_1}) \)\n   - \( T(\vec{e_2}) \)\n   - \( T(\vec{e_n}) \)\n\n4. **Form the Standard Matrix**: The standard matrix $ A $ is constructed by taking the images of the standard basis vectors as columns. Specifically, if \( T(\vec{e_i}) = \vec{v_i} \) for $ i = 1, 2, \ldots, n $, then the standard matrix $ A $ is given by:\n   $$\n   A = \begin{bmatrix} | & | & & | \\ T(\vec{e_1}) & T(\vec{e_2}) & \cdots & T(\vec{e_n}) \\ | & | & & | \end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n\n5. **Use the Matrix**: Once you have the standard matrix $ A $, you can use it to compute the transformation of any vector $ x \in \mathbb{R}^n $ by simply multiplying:\n   $$\n   T(x) = Ax\n   $$\n\nThis process allows you to represent the linear transformation in a matrix form, facilitating calculations and applications in various fields such as computer graphics, engineering, and more.
