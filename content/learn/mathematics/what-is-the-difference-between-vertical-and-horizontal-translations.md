    What is the difference between vertical and horizontal translations?
answer: >-
    The difference between vertical and horizontal translations lies in the direction in which the graph of a function is shifted and how this is mathematically represented.\n\n1. **Vertical Translations**:\n   - A vertical translation moves the graph of a function up or down along the y-axis. This is achieved by adding or subtracting a constant to the function's output. \n   - For a function \(y = f(x)\), a vertical translation can be represented as:\n     - \(g(x) = f(x) + k\) (where $k > 0$ moves the graph up, and $k < 0$ moves it down).\n   - For example, if \(f(x) = x^2\), then \(g(x) = x^2 + 3\) translates the graph of \(f(x)\) upwards by 3 units.\n\n2. **Horizontal Translations**:\n   - A horizontal translation shifts the graph of a function left or right along the x-axis. This is done by adding or subtracting a constant to the function's input.\n   - For a function \(y = f(x)\), a horizontal translation can be represented as:\n     - \(g(x) = f(x - h)\) (where $h > 0$ moves the graph to the right, and $h < 0$ moves it to the left).\n   - For example, if \(f(x) = x^2\), then \(g(x) = f(x - 2) = (x - 2)^2\) translates the graph of \(f(x)\) to the right by 2 units.\n\nIn summary, vertical translations affect the output of the function (y-values), while horizontal translations affect the input (x-values). This distinction is crucial for understanding how to manipulate and graph functions in the coordinate plane.
