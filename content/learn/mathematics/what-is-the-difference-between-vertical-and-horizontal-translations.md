    What is the difference between vertical and horizontal translations?
answer: >-
    The difference between vertical and horizontal translations lies in the direction in which the graph of a function is moved on the coordinate plane.\n\n1. **Vertical Translations**: \n   - A vertical translation moves the graph of a function up or down. This is represented mathematically by adding or subtracting a constant $ k $ to the function. For example, if you have a function \( f(x) \), a vertical translation can be expressed as:\n     - \( f(x) + k \) (moves the graph up by $ k $ units if $ k > 0 $)\n     - \( f(x) - k \) (moves the graph down by $ k $ units if $ k > 0 $)\n   - Each point on the graph is shifted vertically by the same amount, maintaining the shape and orientation of the graph.\n\n2. **Horizontal Translations**: \n   - A horizontal translation moves the graph of a function left or right. This is represented by modifying the input of the function. For example, a horizontal translation can be expressed as:\n     - \( f(x + h) \) (moves the graph left by $ h $ units if $ h > 0 $)\n     - \( f(x - h) \) (moves the graph right by $ h $ units if $ h > 0 $)\n   - Similar to vertical translations, each point on the graph is shifted horizontally by the same amount, preserving the graph's shape and orientation.\n\nIn summary, vertical translations affect the $ y $-coordinates of the points on the graph, while horizontal translations affect the $ x $-coordinates. Both types of translations result in congruent graphs, meaning the shape and orientation of the graph remain unchanged, only the position changes.
