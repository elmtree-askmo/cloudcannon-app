    What are opposite coordinates in the context of reflections?
answer: >-
    In the context of reflections in geometry, "opposite coordinates" refer to the transformation of the coordinates of a point when it is reflected across a specific line, such as the x-axis or y-axis.\n\n1. **Reflection across the x-axis**: When a point \( P(x, y) \) is reflected over the x-axis, the x-coordinate remains unchanged, while the y-coordinate takes on its opposite sign. Therefore, the reflected point $ P' $ will have coordinates \( P'(x, -y) \). For example, if the original point is \( (3, 5) \), its reflection across the x-axis would be \( (3, -5) \).\n\n2. **Reflection across the y-axis**: In this case, the y-coordinate remains the same, while the x-coordinate changes to its opposite sign. Thus, the reflected point $ P' $ will have coordinates \( P'(-x, y) \). For instance, reflecting the point \( (4, 2) \) across the y-axis results in the point \( (-4, 2) \).\n\n3. **Reflection across the line $ y = x $**: Here, the coordinates are swapped, meaning the x-coordinate becomes the y-coordinate and vice versa. The reflected point $ P' $ will have coordinates \( P'(y, x) \). For example, reflecting the point \( (2, 3) \) across the line $ y = x $ gives \( (3, 2) \).\n\nIn summary, opposite coordinates in the context of reflections refer to the changes in the signs of the coordinates or their positions relative to the line of reflection, resulting in a mirrored image of the original point or figure.
