    What is the process of completing the square in a quadratic equation?
answer: >-
    Completing the square is a method used to rewrite a quadratic equation of the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ into a perfect square form, specifically \( (x - p)^2 = q \). This technique is particularly useful for solving quadratic equations and converting them into vertex form, which is \( a(x - h)^2 + k \).\n\nHere is a step-by-step process for completing the square:\n\n1. **Start with the Standard Form**: Begin with the quadratic equation in standard form:\n   $$\n   ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n   $$\n\n2. **Divide by the Leading Coefficient**: If the coefficient $ a $ is not equal to 1, divide the entire equation by $ a $ to normalize the coefficient of $ x^2 $ to 1:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0\n   $$\n\n3. **Rearrange the Equation**: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}\n   $$\n\n4. **Find the Completing Term**: Take half of the coefficient of $ x $ (which is $ \frac{b}{a} $), square it, and add it to both sides of the equation. The completing term is:\n   $$\n   \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n5. **Add the Completing Term**: Add this term to both sides:\n   $$\n   x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n6. **Factor the Left Side**: The left side of the equation can now be factored as a perfect square:\n   $$\n   \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\n   $$\n\n7. **Simplify the Right Side**: Simplify the right side to obtain the completed square form.\n\n8. **Solve for $ x $**: Finally, take the square root of both sides and solve for $ x $:\n   $$\n   x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}\n   $$\n   Rearranging gives:\n   $$\n   x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}\n   $$\n\nThis method not only helps in solving quadratic equations but also provides a way to graph parabolas by identifying the vertex and the direction of opening. Completing the square is a fundamental technique in algebra that enhances understanding of quadratic functions and their properties.
