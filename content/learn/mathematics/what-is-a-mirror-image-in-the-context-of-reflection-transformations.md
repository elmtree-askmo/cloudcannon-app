    What is a mirror image in the context of reflection transformations?
answer: >-
    In the context of reflection transformations, a mirror image refers to the result of flipping a geometric figure across a specific line known as the line of reflection. This transformation creates a new figure that is congruent to the original, meaning it retains the same size and shape but appears reversed or mirrored.\n\n### Key Aspects of Mirror Images in Reflection Transformations:\n\n1. **Line of Reflection**: The line that acts as the "mirror" for the reflection. Common lines of reflection include:\n   - The x-axis\n   - The y-axis\n   - The line $y = x$\n\n2. **Isometric Transformation**: Reflection is classified as an isometric transformation, which means that the distances between points in the original figure and the reflected figure remain unchanged. The original figure and its mirror image are congruent.\n\n3. **Orientation**: While the size and shape are preserved, the orientation of the figure is inverted. For example, if a shape is facing to the right before reflection, its mirror image will face to the left.\n\n4. **Applications**: Mirror images are commonly observed in everyday life, such as when looking into a mirror. In mathematics, they are used in various geometric proofs and constructions.\n\n5. **Coordinates**: When reflecting a point across a line, the coordinates of the point change according to the position of the line of reflection. For instance, reflecting a point \((x, y)\) across the y-axis results in the point \((-x, y)\).\n\nIn summary, a mirror image in reflection transformations is the result of flipping a geometric figure across a line of reflection, producing a congruent figure that is laterally inverted. This concept is fundamental in understanding symmetry and geometric transformations in mathematics.
