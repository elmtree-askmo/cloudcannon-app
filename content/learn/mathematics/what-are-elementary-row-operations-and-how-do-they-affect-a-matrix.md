    What are elementary row operations and how do they affect a matrix?
answer: >-
    Elementary row operations are fundamental manipulations that can be performed on the rows of a matrix to facilitate the process of solving systems of linear equations, particularly through methods like Gaussian elimination. There are three primary types of elementary row operations:\n\n1. **Row Interchange (Switching Rows)**: This operation involves swapping two rows of the matrix. For example, if you have rows $ R_i $ and $ R_j $, you can perform the operation $ R_i \leftrightarrow R_j $. This operation changes the order of the rows but does not affect the solutions of the system represented by the matrix.\n\n2. **Row Scaling (Multiplying a Row by a Non-Zero Constant)**: This operation involves multiplying all entries in a row by a non-zero scalar $ c $. For instance, if you multiply row $ R_i $ by $ c $, the operation is denoted as $ R_i \rightarrow cR_i $. This operation scales the row but does not change the solution set of the system.\n\n3. **Row Replacement (Adding a Multiple of One Row to Another)**: This operation involves replacing one row with the sum of itself and a multiple of another row. For example, if you want to replace row $ R_i $ with $ R_i + cR_j $ (where $ c $ is a scalar), you perform the operation $ R_i \rightarrow R_i + cR_j $. This operation is particularly useful for creating zeros in specific positions of the matrix.\n\nThese elementary row operations are crucial in transforming a matrix into row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, which are forms that make it easier to identify solutions to the corresponding system of equations. \n\nThe effects of these operations on the matrix are significant:\n- They maintain the equivalence of the system of equations represented by the matrix.\n- They can change the determinant of the matrix, with specific effects for each operation:\n  - Interchanging two rows changes the sign of the determinant.\n  - Scaling a row by a non-zero constant multiplies the determinant by that constant.\n  - Adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the determinant.\n\nIn summary, elementary row operations are essential tools in linear algebra for manipulating matrices and solving systems of equations, allowing for systematic approaches to finding solutions.
