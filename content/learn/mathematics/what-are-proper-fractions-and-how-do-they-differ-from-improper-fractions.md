answer: >-
    Proper fractions and improper fractions are two distinct types of fractions that differ primarily in the relationship between their numerators and denominators.\n\n1. **Proper Fractions**: A proper fraction is defined as a fraction where the numerator (the top number) is less than the denominator (the bottom number). This means that the value of a proper fraction is always less than 1. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ are proper fractions because 1 is less than 2, and 3 is less than 4.\n\n2. **Improper Fractions**: In contrast, an improper fraction is one where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator. This indicates that the value of an improper fraction is greater than or equal to 1. Examples of improper fractions include $\frac{4}{3}$ and $\frac{11}{4}$, where 4 is greater than 3, and 11 is greater than 4.\n\n3. **Mixed Numbers**: Additionally, an improper fraction can be expressed as a mixed number, which combines a whole number and a proper fraction. For instance, the improper fraction $\frac{7}{4}$ can be written as the mixed number $1 \frac{3}{4}$.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the relationship between the numerator and denominator: proper fractions are always less than 1, while improper fractions are equal to or greater than 1. Understanding this distinction is crucial for mastering basic mathematical concepts involving fractions.
