    To calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified interval, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\n$$\n\nwhere \( f(x) \) is the function, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the endpoints of the interval.\n\nHere are a few examples to illustrate how to calculate the average rate of change:\n\n### Example 1: Quadratic Function\n**Function:** \( f(x) = x^2 \)  \n**Interval:** From \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \)\n\n1. Calculate \( f(1) \) and \( f(3) \):\n   - \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \)\n   - \( f(3) = 3^2 = 9 \)\n\n2. Apply the average rate of change formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{9 - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{8}{2} = 4\n   $$\n\n### Example 2: Linear Function\n**Function:** \( f(x) = 2x + 10 \)  \n**Interval:** From \( x = 3 \) to \( x = 7 \)\n\n1. Calculate \( f(3) \) and \( f(7) \):\n   - \( f(3) = 2(3) + 10 = 6 + 10 = 16 \)\n   - \( f(7) = 2(7) + 10 = 14 + 10 = 24 \)\n\n2. Apply the average rate of change formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(7) - f(3)}{7 - 3} = \frac{24 - 16}{7 - 3} = \frac{8}{4} = 2\n   $$\n\n### Example 3: Another Quadratic Function\n**Function:** \( f(x) = x^2 + 3x \)  \n**Interval:** From \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \)\n\n1. Calculate \( f(1) \) and \( f(3) \):\n   - \( f(1) = 1^2 + 3(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)\n   - \( f(3) = 3^2 + 3(3) = 9 + 9 = 18 \)\n\n2. Apply the average rate of change formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{18 - 4}{3 - 1} = \frac{14}{2} = 7\n   $$\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to compute the average rate of change for different types of functions over specified intervals. The average rate of change provides insight into how the function behaves between two points, effectively representing the slope of the secant line connecting those points on the graph of the function.
