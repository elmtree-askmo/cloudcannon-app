    How does increasing the number of harmonics affect the Fourier Series representation?
answer: >-
    Increasing the number of harmonics in a Fourier Series representation significantly affects the accuracy and fidelity of the approximation of a periodic function. The Fourier Series allows us to express any periodic waveform as a sum of sine and cosine functions, each corresponding to different harmonic frequencies.\n\n1. **Improved Approximation**: As more harmonics are added, the Fourier Series can more closely approximate the original waveform. This is particularly important for non-sinusoidal waveforms, such as square waves, which contain sharp transitions. For example, a square wave can be represented as:\n   $$\n   e = \frac{4E_{m}}{\pi} \left[ \sin(\omega t) + \frac{\sin(3\omega t)}{3} + \frac{\sin(5\omega t)}{5} + \frac{\sin(7\omega t)}{7} + \ldots \right]\n   $$\n   Here, the fundamental frequency and its odd harmonics contribute to the shape of the square wave. Adding more terms allows for a better representation of the waveform's sharp edges.\n\n2. **Diminishing Amplitudes**: It is important to note that the amplitudes of the harmonic components decrease as the harmonic frequency increases. For instance, the amplitude of the third harmonic is $\frac{4E_{m}}{3\pi}$, the fifth harmonic is $\frac{4E_{m}}{5\pi}$, and so on. This trend continues, leading to smaller contributions from higher harmonics:\n   - Fundamental: $E_{m1} = \frac{4E_{m}}{\pi}$\n   - Third Harmonic: $E_{m3} = \frac{4E_{m}}{3\pi}$\n   - Fifth Harmonic: $E_{m5} = \frac{4E_{m}}{5\pi}$\n   - Seventh Harmonic: $E_{m7} = \frac{4E_{m}}{7\pi}$\n\n3. **Convergence**: The series converges to the original function as the number of harmonics approaches infinity. However, in practical applications, a finite number of harmonics is often used, which can lead to phenomena such as Gibbs phenomenon, where overshoots occur near discontinuities.\n\n4. **Visualization**: When visualizing the Fourier Series, increasing the number of harmonics results in a waveform that increasingly resembles the original function. This can be illustrated through plots that show the original waveform alongside its Fourier Series approximation with varying numbers of harmonics.\n\nIn summary, increasing the number of harmonics in a Fourier Series representation enhances the approximation of periodic functions, particularly those with sharp transitions, while the amplitudes of higher harmonics diminish, contributing less to the overall shape of the waveform.
