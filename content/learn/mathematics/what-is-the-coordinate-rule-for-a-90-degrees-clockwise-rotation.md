    What is the coordinate rule for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation?
answer: >-
    The coordinate rule for a 90 degrees clockwise rotation about the origin is given by the transformation:\n\n$$(x, y) \rightarrow (y, -x)$$\n\nThis means that if you have a point with coordinates \((x, y)\), after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, the new coordinates will be \((y, -x)\).\n\nFor example, if you have a point \(M(3, 4)\), after applying the 90 degrees clockwise rotation rule, the new coordinates will be:\n\n$$\nM' = (4, -3)\n$$\n\nThis transformation is useful in various geometric applications, including rotating shapes and analyzing their properties on the coordinate plane.
