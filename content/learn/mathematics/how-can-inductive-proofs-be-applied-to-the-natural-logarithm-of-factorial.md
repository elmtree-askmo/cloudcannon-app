    How can inductive proofs be applied to the natural logarithm of factorial?
answer: >-
    Inductive proofs can be effectively applied to establish properties related to the natural logarithm of factorials, particularly in proving inequalities or identities involving the logarithm of factorials. Hereâ€™s how you can approach this using mathematical induction:\n\n### Statement to Prove\nLet's consider the statement:\n$$\n\ln(n!) \leq n \ln(n) - n \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1.\n$$\n\n### Step 1: Base Case\nFirst, we need to verify the base case, which is when $ n = 1 $:\n$$\n\ln(1!) = \ln(1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \ln(1) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n$$\nThus, $ 0 \leq -1 $ is false, so we need to check for $ n = 2 $:\n$$\n\ln(2!) = \ln(2) \quad \text{and} \quad 2 \ln(2) - 2 = 2 \ln(2) - 2.\n$$\nSince \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \), we have:\n$$\n\ln(2) \approx 0.693 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 \ln(2) - 2 \approx 1.386 - 2 = -0.614.\n$$\nThus, $ 0.693 \leq -0.614 $ is also false. Let's check for $ n = 3 $:\n$$\n\ln(3!) = \ln(6) \approx 1.792 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \ln(3) - 3 \approx 3 \cdot 1.099 - 3 = 3.297 - 3 = 0.297.\n$$\nHere, $ 1.792 \leq 0.297 $ is false. We can continue checking until we find a valid base case, or we can adjust our statement.\n\n### Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis\nAssume the statement is true for some integer $ k \geq 1 $:\n$$\n\ln(k!) \leq k \ln(k) - k.\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Inductive Step\nWe need to show that if the statement holds for $ k $, it also holds for $ k + 1 $:\n$$\n\ln((k + 1)!) = \ln((k + 1) \cdot k!) = \ln(k + 1) + \ln(k!).\n$$\nUsing the inductive hypothesis:\n$$\n\ln((k + 1)!) \leq \ln(k + 1) + (k \ln(k) - k).\n$$\nWe need to show:\n$$\n\ln(k + 1) + k \ln(k) - k \leq (k + 1) \ln(k + 1) - (k + 1).\n$$\nThis can be rearranged and simplified, but it may require additional properties of logarithms and inequalities to complete the proof.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe application of mathematical induction to the natural logarithm of factorials allows us to establish inequalities and identities that hold for all natural numbers. The process involves verifying a base case, assuming the statement for an arbitrary case $ k $, and then proving it for $ k + 1 $. \n\nThis method is powerful in combinatorial proofs and can be extended to other properties involving factorials and logarithms. If you have a specific property or identity in mind regarding the natural logarithm of factorials, please provide that for a more tailored proof.
