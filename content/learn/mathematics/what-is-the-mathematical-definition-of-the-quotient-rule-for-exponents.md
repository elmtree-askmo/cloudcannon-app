answer: >-
    The Quotient Rule for Exponents is a fundamental principle in algebra that simplifies the division of two exponential expressions with the same base. The rule states that when dividing two numbers (or expressions) that have the same base, you can subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\n$$\n\nwhere $ a $ is the base, and $ m $ and $ n $ are the exponents. This rule is applicable only when the bases are identical.\n\nFor example, if you have the expression $ \frac{y^9}{y^5} $, you can apply the Quotient Rule as follows:\n\n$$\n\frac{y^9}{y^5} = y^{9-5} = y^4\n$$\n\nIt is important to note that the Quotient Rule can only be used when the bases in the numerator and denominator are the same. If the bases differ, the rule cannot be applied directly, and you would need to manipulate the expression to make the bases the same before applying the rule.
