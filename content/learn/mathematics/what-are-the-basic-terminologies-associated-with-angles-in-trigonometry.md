    What are the basic terminologies associated with angles in trigonometry?
answer: >-
    In trigonometry, several basic terminologies are essential for understanding angles and their properties. Here are some key terms associated with angles:\n\n1. **Angle**: An angle is defined as a measure of the space between two rays that share a common endpoint, known as the vertex. \n\n2. **Vertex**: The vertex of an angle is the point where the two rays meet.\n\n3. **Initial Side and Terminal Side**: An angle is formed by rotating a ray (the initial side) around the vertex to a new position (the terminal side). The orientation of the angle can be clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n4. **Positive and Negative Angles**: A positive angle is formed by a counterclockwise rotation from the initial side, while a negative angle is formed by a clockwise rotation.\n\n5. **Degree and Radian**: Angles can be measured in degrees or radians. A full circle is divided into 360 degrees or $2\pi$ radians. \n\n6. **Acute Angle**: An angle that measures less than 90 degrees (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians).\n\n7. **Right Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 90 degrees (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians).\n\n8. **Obtuse Angle**: An angle that measures more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees (or between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\pi$ radians).\n\n9. **Straight Angle**: An angle that measures exactly 180 degrees (or $\pi$ radians).\n\n10. **Reflex Angle**: An angle that measures more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees (or between $\pi$ and $2\pi$ radians).\n\n11. **Special Angles**: Certain angles, such as 30° (or $\frac{\pi}{6}$), 45° (or $\frac{\pi}{4}$), and 60° (or $\frac{\pi}{3}$), are commonly used in trigonometry due to their specific sine, cosine, and tangent values.\n\nUnderstanding these basic terminologies is crucial for students studying trigonometry, as they form the foundation for more complex concepts and applications in geometry and mathematics.
