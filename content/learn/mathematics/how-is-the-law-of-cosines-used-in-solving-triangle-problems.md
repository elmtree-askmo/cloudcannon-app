    How is the Law of Cosines used in solving triangle problems?
answer: >-
    The Law of Cosines is a fundamental theorem in trigonometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. It is particularly useful in solving triangle problems when certain conditions are met. The Law of Cosines can be expressed with the following formulas:\n\n1. For a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively, the Law of Cosines states:\n   $$\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C)\n   $$\n   Similarly, the other two forms are:\n   $$\n   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \cos(A)\n   $$\n   $$\n   b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cdot \cos(B)\n   $$\n\nThe Law of Cosines is particularly applicable in two main scenarios:\n\n1. **When two sides and the included angle (SAS) are known**: If you know the lengths of two sides of a triangle and the measure of the included angle, you can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side. For example, if $a = 8$, $b = 6$, and $C = 60^\circ$, you can calculate $c$ using:\n   $$\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C)\n   $$\n\n2. **When all three sides (SSS) are known**: If you know the lengths of all three sides of a triangle, you can use the Law of Cosines to find the measures of any of the angles. For instance, to find angle $C$, you can rearrange the formula:\n   $$\n   \cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\n   $$\n\nThe Law of Cosines is essential for solving triangles that are not right-angled, as it provides a method to determine unknown lengths and angles. It is also a powerful tool in various applications, including geometry, physics, and engineering, where precise measurements and calculations are required.
