    Ambiguity in language is a common phenomenon where sentences can be interpreted in multiple ways due to their structure or wording. Here are some common examples of ambiguity:\n\n1. **Lexical Ambiguity**: This occurs when a word has multiple meanings. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.\n\n2. **Syntactic Ambiguity**: This arises from the structure of a sentence. For instance, the sentence "I saw the man with the telescope" can mean that the speaker used a telescope to see the man or that the man had a telescope.\n\n3. **Scope Ambiguity**: This happens when it is unclear how far a quantifier applies. For example, "All students passed the exam" can be interpreted as every student passed or that there is a group of students who passed.\n\n4. **Pronoun Ambiguity**: This occurs when it is unclear to whom a pronoun refers. For example, in the sentence "John told Bill that he was going to win," it is ambiguous whether "he" refers to John or Bill.\n\nLogic can help resolve these ambiguities by providing a structured framework for translating statements into precise logical propositions. By using logical operators, we can create unambiguous representations of complex statements. For example:\n\n- **Negation (¬)**: Clarifies what is not the case.\n- **Conjunction (∧)**: Combines two statements, both of which must be true.\n- **Disjunction (∨)**: Indicates that at least one of the statements is true.\n- **Exclusive-or (⊕)**: Specifies that exactly one of the statements is true.\n- **Implication (→)**: Establishes a conditional relationship between statements.\n- **Equivalence (↔)**: Indicates that two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nBy translating ambiguous sentences into logical forms using these operators, we can eliminate confusion and clarify meanings, thus resolving ambiguities inherent in human language. For instance, the ambiguous sentence "I saw the man with the telescope" could be translated into logical propositions that specify the intended meaning, thereby providing clarity.
