    What is the Fundamental Counting Principle?
answer: >-
    The Fundamental Counting Principle (FCP) is a foundational concept in combinatorics and probability that provides a systematic way to count the total number of possible outcomes in a given scenario. It states that if one event can occur in $ m $ ways and a second independent event can occur in $ n $ ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur is given by the product $ m \times n $.\n\nIn more formal terms, if there are $ n_1 $ ways to choose the first item, $ n_2 $ ways to choose the second item after the first has been chosen, and so on, up to $ n_k $ ways to choose the $ k $-th item, the total number of choices is calculated as:\n\n$$\nn_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times \ldots \times n_k\n$$\n\nThis principle is particularly useful in various applications, such as calculating the number of possible outfits, telephone numbers, or answers in a multiple-choice quiz.\n\n### Example Problems\n\n1. **Outfits**: If a person has 4 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the total number of outfit combinations can be calculated as:\n   $$ \n   4 \text{ (shirts)} \times 3 \text{ (pants)} = 12 \text{ outfits} \n   $$\n\n2. **Telephone Numbers**: If a telephone number consists of 3 digits followed by 4 digits, where each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, the total number of possible telephone numbers is:\n   $$\n   10^3 \text{ (for the first three digits)} \times 10^4 \text{ (for the last four digits)} = 10^7 = 10,000,000 \text{ possible numbers}\n   $$\n\n3. **Multiple Choice Quiz**: If a quiz has 5 questions and each question has 4 possible answers, the total number of ways to answer the quiz is:\n   $$\n   4^5 = 1024 \text{ different ways to answer the quiz}\n   $$\n\n### Applications in Probability and Combinatorics\n\nThe Fundamental Counting Principle is essential for solving many problems in probability and combinatorics. It helps in determining the likelihood of various outcomes and is a key tool in understanding more complex concepts such as permutations and combinations, where the order of selection may or may not matter.\n\nIn summary, the Fundamental Counting Principle simplifies the process of counting outcomes in various scenarios, making it a vital concept in mathematics, particularly in the fields of probability and combinatorics.
