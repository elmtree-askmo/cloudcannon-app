    What is the effect of a horizontal translation on the coordinates of a point?
answer: >-
    A horizontal translation affects the coordinates of a point by changing its x-coordinate while keeping its y-coordinate constant. Specifically, when a point is translated horizontally to the right by a certain number of units, you add that number to the x-coordinate. Conversely, if the point is translated to the left, you subtract that number from the x-coordinate.\n\nFor example, if you have a point \( P(x, y) \) and you translate it horizontally by $ d $ units to the right, the new coordinates of the point will be \( P'(x + d, y) \). If you translate it $ d $ units to the left, the new coordinates will be \( P'(x - d, y) \).\n\nIn summary, the effect of a horizontal translation on the coordinates of a point can be expressed as follows:\n\n- **Translation to the right:** \( P(x, y) \rightarrow P'(x + d, y) \)\n- **Translation to the left:** \( P(x, y) \rightarrow P'(x - d, y) \)\n\nThis transformation maintains the vertical position of the point, as the y-coordinate remains unchanged.
