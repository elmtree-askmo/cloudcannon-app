    How are conversion formulas used to switch between cylindrical and rectangular coordinates?
answer: >-
    To convert between cylindrical and rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, specific formulas are used that relate the two systems. The cylindrical coordinate system is defined by three parameters: \( (r, \theta, z) \), where $ r $ is the radial distance from the origin to the projection of the point onto the $ xy $-plane, $ \theta $ is the angle measured from the positive $ x $-axis, and $ z $ is the height above the $ xy $-plane.\n\n### Conversion Formulas\n\n1. **From Cylindrical to Rectangular Coordinates**:\n   To convert cylindrical coordinates \( (r, \theta, z) \) to rectangular coordinates \( (x, y, z) \), the following formulas are used:\n   $$\n   \begin{aligned}\n   x &= r \cos \theta, \\\n   y &= r \sin \theta, \\\n   z &= z.\n   \end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n2. **From Rectangular to Cylindrical Coordinates**:\n   To convert rectangular coordinates \( (x, y, z) \) to cylindrical coordinates \( (r, \theta, z) \), the formulas are:\n   $$\n   \begin{aligned}\n   r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\\n   \theta &= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right), \\\n   z &= z.\n   \end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n### Example of Conversion\n\nFor instance, if you have cylindrical coordinates \( (4, \frac{2\pi}{3}, -2) \):\n- To convert to rectangular coordinates:\n  $$\n  \begin{aligned}\n  x &= 4 \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = -2, \\\n  y &= 4 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = 2\sqrt{3}, \\\n  z &= -2.\n  \end{aligned}\n  $$\n\nConversely, if you start with rectangular coordinates \( (-2, 2\sqrt{3}, -2) \):\n- To convert to cylindrical coordinates:\n  $$\n  \begin{aligned}\n  r &= \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (2\sqrt{3})^2} = 4, \\\n  \theta &= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{-2}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3}, \\\n  z &= -2.\n  \end{aligned}\n  $$\n\nThese conversion formulas are essential in various applications, particularly in physics and engineering, where different coordinate systems may be more convenient for solving problems involving symmetry or specific geometries.
