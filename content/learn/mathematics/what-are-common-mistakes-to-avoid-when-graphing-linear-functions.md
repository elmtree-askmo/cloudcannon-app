    When graphing linear functions, there are several common mistakes that students often make. Avoiding these pitfalls can significantly improve the accuracy and clarity of their graphs. Here are some key mistakes to watch out for:\n\n1. **Incorrectly Identifying the Slope and Y-Intercept**: Students may misinterpret the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. It's crucial to correctly identify these values before plotting.\n\n2. **Plotting Points Incorrectly**: When plotting points based on the equation, students might misplace points on the graph. It's important to double-check the coordinates to ensure they correspond to the equation being graphed.\n\n3. **Using Incorrect Slopes**: When determining slopes, especially for perpendicular lines, students may confuse the concept of slopes. They might use the reciprocal instead of the negative reciprocal. Understanding that perpendicular lines have slopes that multiply to $-1$ is essential.\n\n4. **Failing to Label Axes**: Not labeling the x-axis and y-axis, including the scale, can lead to confusion. Clear labeling enhances the readability of the graph and helps others understand the plotted data.\n\n5. **Assuming Continuity**: Students may assume that a linear function is continuous without checking for breaks or jumps. While linear functions are continuous, it's important to verify this for piecewise functions or other types of graphs.\n\n6. **Not Checking Answers**: After graphing, students often forget to verify their work. Checking that the plotted points satisfy the original equation can help catch errors.\n\n7. **Neglecting to Extend the Graph**: When drawing the line, students might not extend it sufficiently in both directions. A well-extended line helps illustrate the function's behavior beyond the plotted points.\n\n8. **Overlooking the Importance of Practice**: Many students underestimate the value of practice in mastering graphing techniques. Regularly working through examples reinforces concepts and improves problem-solving skills.\n\nBy being aware of these common mistakes, students can enhance their graphing skills and better understand the relationships represented by linear functions.
