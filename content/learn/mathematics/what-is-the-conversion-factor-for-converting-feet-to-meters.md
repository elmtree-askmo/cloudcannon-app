answer: >-
    The conversion factor for converting feet to meters is approximately 0.3048. This means that 1 foot is equal to 0.3048 meters. \n\nTo convert a measurement from feet to meters, you can use the following formula:\n\n$$\n\text{meters} = \text{feet} \times 0.3048\n$$\n\nFor example, if you want to convert 10 feet to meters, you would calculate it as follows:\n\n$$\n10 \text{ feet} \times 0.3048 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{foot}} = 3.048 \text{ m}\n$$\n\nThis conversion factor is essential for length conversion tasks, especially when working with different measurement systems.
