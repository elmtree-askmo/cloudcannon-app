    What are the unique digits used in the binary system?
answer: >-
    The unique digits used in the binary system are 0 and 1. The binary numbering system is a base-2 system, meaning it only utilizes these two digits to represent all possible values. Each digit in this system is referred to as a bit, and it serves as the fundamental building block for representing information in computers and other digital systems.\n\nIn summary, the binary system consists solely of the following unique digits:\n- 0\n- 1\n\nThis simplicity is what makes binary essential for computer operations, as all digital data and programming languages ultimately rely on these two digits to encode information.
