    How do cube roots relate to fractional exponents?
answer: >-
    Cube roots are closely related to fractional exponents, as they can be expressed using this notation. The cube root of a number $ x $ is denoted as $ \sqrt[3]{x} $ or $ x^{1/3} $. This means that the cube root of $ x $ is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals $ x $. \n\nIn the context of fractional exponents, a fractional exponent $ a^{m/n} $ can be interpreted as the $ n $-th root of $ a $ raised to the $ m $-th power. Specifically, for cube roots, if we have a number raised to the power of $ 1/3 $, it indicates that we are taking the cube root of that number. \n\nFor example, consider the expression $ 64^{2/3} $. This can be broken down into two steps:\n1. First, find the cube root of 64, which is $ 4 $ (since $ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64 $).\n2. Then, square that result: $ 4^2 = 16 $.\n\nThus, $ 64^{2/3} = 16 $.\n\nSimilarly, another example is $ 8^{2/3} $:\n1. The cube root of 8 is $ 2 $ (since $ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8 $).\n2. Squaring that result gives $ 2^2 = 4 $.\n\nTherefore, $ 8^{2/3} = 4 $.\n\nIn summary, cube roots can be expressed as fractional exponents, specifically $ x^{1/3} $, and this notation allows for easier manipulation of expressions involving roots.
