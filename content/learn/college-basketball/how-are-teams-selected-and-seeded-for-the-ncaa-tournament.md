    How are teams selected and seeded for the NCAA tournament?
answer: >-
    A 12-member NCAA committee selects and seeds teams based on various factors, including regular-season performance, strength of schedule, and quality wins. Thirty-one teams earn automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments, while the remaining 37 are chosen as at-large bids. Teams are then seeded 1-16 in four regions to create the tournament bracket.
