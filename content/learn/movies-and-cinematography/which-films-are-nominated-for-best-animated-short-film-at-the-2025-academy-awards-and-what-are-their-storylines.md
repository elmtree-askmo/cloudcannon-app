answer: >-
    The nominees for Best Animated Short Film are:\n\nBeautiful Men\nMoi-même\nPaul\nThe Light\nHard Truths\nBeautiful Men is a Belgian-French-Dutch co-production that explores themes of identity and societal expectations through a unique visual style. Moi-même resurrects an abandoned film capturing a revolution in Paris, blending historical footage with modern animation techniques. Paul, directed by Denis Côté, portrays a man's coping mechanism with depression through cleaning, using a minimalist aesthetic to convey deep emotional resonance. The Light, a maximalist piece by Tom Tykwer, presents a complex narrative that intertwines multiple characters' lives, though it has received mixed reviews for its ambitious approach. Hard Truths offers a raw portrayal of personal and societal challenges, utilizing stark animation to emphasize its themes. \nFILM STAGE\n\n\n
