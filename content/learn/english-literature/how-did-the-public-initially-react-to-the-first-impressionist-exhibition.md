    How did the public initially react to the first Impressionist exhibition?
answer: >-
    The public reaction to the First Impressionist Exhibition, held in 1874, was notably mixed and often hostile. Many attendees were intrigued by the new artistic styles presented, but a significant portion of the audience and critics derided the works as unfinished or lacking in technical skill. The term "Impressionist" itself was initially used in a derogatory manner, stemming from the title of Claude Monet's painting "Impression, Sunrise," which was featured in the exhibition and ultimately gave the movement its name.\n\nDespite the negative reception from some quarters, the exhibition was crucial in establishing a foundation for the Impressionist movement. It marked a significant turning point in the acceptance of modern art, as it allowed artists to break free from the constraints of the official Salon, which had become increasingly conservative. Over time, as the public began to appreciate the innovative approaches to light, color, and subject matter showcased in the exhibition, the Impressionist style gained wider acceptance and recognition.\n\nIn summary, while the initial public response was largely critical, the First Impressionist Exhibition played a vital role in paving the way for the eventual acceptance and appreciation of Impressionism in the art world.
