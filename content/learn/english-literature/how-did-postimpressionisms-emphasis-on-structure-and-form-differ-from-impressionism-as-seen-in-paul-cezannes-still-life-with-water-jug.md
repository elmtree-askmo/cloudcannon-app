    Post-Impressionism, which emerged in the late 19th century, marked a significant departure from the principles of Impressionism, particularly in its emphasis on structure and form. This shift is exemplified in Paul Cézanne's work, "Still Life with Water Jug" (1892-93).\n\n### Differences in Emphasis\n\n1. **Focus on Structure**: \n   - **Post-Impressionism**: Cézanne's approach is characterized by a deliberate focus on the underlying structure of objects. He often used geometric shapes to represent forms, which can be seen in the way he depicts the water jug and other elements in the still life. This method creates a sense of solidity and permanence, suggesting that the essence of objects can be captured through their shapes and relationships.\n   - **Impressionism**: In contrast, Impressionists like Claude Monet prioritized the transient effects of light and color over the structural integrity of the subjects. Their works often feature loose brushwork and a focus on capturing the momentary play of light, which can lead to a more fluid and less defined representation of forms.\n\n2. **Color and Composition**:\n   - **Post-Impressionism**: Cézanne employed a more structured use of color, often applying it in patches or planes that contribute to the overall composition. His use of color is not merely to depict light but to build form and depth, as seen in the way he layers colors to create volume in the water jug and surrounding objects.\n   - **Impressionism**: Impressionists typically used color to convey the effects of light on surfaces, often blending colors on the canvas to achieve a sense of immediacy and movement. The colors in Impressionist works are often vibrant and applied in a way that captures the fleeting nature of the scene.\n\n3. **Emotional and Symbolic Depth**:\n   - **Post-Impressionism**: Cézanne's work often invites viewers to engage with the emotional and symbolic aspects of the composition. The arrangement of objects in "Still Life with Water Jug" can be interpreted as a reflection of the artist's inner thoughts and feelings, moving beyond mere representation to convey a deeper meaning.\n   - **Impressionism**: While Impressionists also sought to evoke emotion, their focus was primarily on the immediate sensory experience of a scene rather than on conveying a specific emotional or symbolic narrative.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Post-Impressionism, as demonstrated in Cézanne's "Still Life with Water Jug," emphasizes structure, form, and emotional depth, contrasting sharply with the Impressionist focus on light, color, and the ephemeral nature of the moment. This shift not only reflects a change in artistic technique but also represents a broader evolution in the understanding of art's purpose and expression during the late 19th century.
