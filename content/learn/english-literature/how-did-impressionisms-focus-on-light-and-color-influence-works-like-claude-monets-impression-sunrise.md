answer: >-
    Impressionism, which emerged in the late 19th century, fundamentally transformed the approach to painting by emphasizing the effects of light and color. This movement is epitomized by Claude Monet's work "Impression, Sunrise," which not only gave the movement its name but also showcased its core principles.\n\nMonet's "Impression, Sunrise" exemplifies the Impressionist focus on capturing the transient effects of light. The painting depicts a sunrise over the port of Le Havre, using loose brushwork and a vibrant palette to convey the atmosphere of the moment. The colors are applied in a way that reflects the changing light, with soft blues, oranges, and yellows blending together to create a sense of immediacy and movement. This technique allows viewers to experience the scene as if they were present at that moment, highlighting the fleeting nature of time and perception.\n\nThe loose brushwork characteristic of Impressionism allows for a more subjective interpretation of the scene, moving away from the detailed realism of previous art movements. Instead of focusing on precise details, Monet and his contemporaries aimed to capture the essence of a moment, emphasizing how light interacts with the environment. This approach not only influenced the visual aspects of painting but also encouraged artists to explore their personal perceptions and emotional responses to their subjects.\n\nFurthermore, the practice of painting en plein air (outdoors) was crucial to the Impressionist movement. It allowed artists to observe and capture the changing qualities of light and atmosphere directly, leading to a more dynamic and spontaneous representation of their surroundings. This method was a significant departure from the traditional studio practices of the time, where artists often relied on sketches and memory.\n\nIn summary, Impressionism's focus on light and color, as demonstrated in Monet's "Impression, Sunrise," marked a pivotal shift in the art world. It laid the groundwork for modern art by challenging established norms and encouraging a more personal and emotional approach to artistic expression. This movement not only influenced subsequent styles, such as Post-Impressionism and Expressionism, but also reshaped the way artists engage with their environment and convey their experiences.
