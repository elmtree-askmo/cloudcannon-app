    What distinguishes non-Olympian deities from Olympian gods in Greek mythology?
answer: >-
    In Greek mythology, the distinction between non-Olympian deities and Olympian gods is primarily based on their residence, roles, and the nature of their worship.\n\n1. **Residence**: Olympian gods are typically associated with Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, which is considered their divine abode. The twelve main Olympian gods include Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, and Dionysus, among others. In contrast, non-Olympian deities may reside in various other realms, such as the Underworld (e.g., Hades and Persephone) or natural settings (e.g., nymphs and river gods).\n\n2. **Roles and Domains**: Olympian gods often have broad and significant domains that encompass major aspects of life and the universe, such as the sky, sea, agriculture, and wisdom. They are central figures in many myths and are often involved in the affairs of mortals. Non-Olympian deities, on the other hand, may have more specialized roles. For example, nymphs are associated with specific natural features like rivers, trees, or mountains, and chthonic gods (like Hades) govern the Underworld and the afterlife.\n\n3. **Worship Practices**: The mode of worship also differs. Olympian gods were typically honored at grand altars and temples, where public sacrifices and festivals were held. Non-Olympian deities, particularly chthonic gods, were often worshipped in more private or localized settings, such as pits (bothroi) or sunken chambers (megaron), reflecting their different roles in the spiritual life of the Greeks.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: Olympian gods are often seen as the primary figures in Greek mythology, embodying the ideals and values of ancient Greek culture. They are frequently depicted in epic poetry and mythological narratives, showcasing their interactions with heroes and mortals. Non-Olympian deities, while important, often play supporting roles in these narratives and may not be as widely recognized or celebrated.\n\nIn summary, the key distinctions between non-Olympian deities and Olympian gods in Greek mythology lie in their residence, roles, worship practices, and cultural significance, with Olympian gods being the more prominent figures in the pantheon.
