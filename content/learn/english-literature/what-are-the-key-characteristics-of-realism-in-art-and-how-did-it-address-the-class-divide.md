    Realism in art emerged in the mid-19th century as a significant movement that sought to depict life as it truly was, in stark contrast to the idealized and emotional representations characteristic of Romanticism. Here are the key characteristics of Realism and how it addressed the class divide:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Realism\n\n1. **Focus on Everyday Life**: Realism emphasizes the portrayal of ordinary people and their daily activities. Artists often depicted the lives of the working class, rural communities, and the struggles of everyday existence.\n\n2. **Social Commentary**: Realist artists aimed to address social issues such as poverty, labor conditions, and the struggles of the lower classes. Their works often served as a critique of societal norms and injustices, bringing attention to the realities that were frequently overlooked by the upper classes.\n\n3. **Attention to Detail**: Realism is characterized by meticulous attention to detail, portraying subjects with accuracy and authenticity. This approach avoids idealization or romantic embellishment, instead presenting a truthful representation of life.\n\n4. **Rejection of Idealism**: Unlike Romanticism, which often glorified nature and human emotion, Realism focused on the mundane and the unvarnished truth of human experience. This included the depiction of harsh realities and the dignity of labor.\n\n### Addressing the Class Divide\n\nRealism directly addressed the class divide by focusing on the lives and struggles of the working class and marginalized groups. The movement emerged during a time of significant social change, particularly due to the Industrial Revolution, which led to urbanization and the growth of a distinct working class. Artists like Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet highlighted the dignity of labor and the plight of the poor, aiming to foster empathy and awareness among viewers.\n\nFor example, Millet's painting "The Gleaners" exemplifies this focus on the working class. It depicts peasant women gathering leftover grain, emphasizing their labor and the social issues surrounding poverty and agricultural life. By portraying these subjects with dignity and respect, Realist artists sought to challenge the prevailing social hierarchies and encourage a more equitable understanding of society.\n\nIn summary, Realism's commitment to depicting everyday life and social issues with accuracy and authenticity allowed it to serve as a powerful vehicle for addressing the class divide, fostering a greater awareness of the struggles faced by ordinary people in 19th-century society.
