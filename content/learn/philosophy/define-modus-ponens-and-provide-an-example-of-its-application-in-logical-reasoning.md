    Define Modus Ponens and provide an example of its application in logical reasoning.
answer: >-
    Modus Ponens is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement of the form $ P \rightarrow Q $ (if P then Q) and we know that $ P $ is true, we can conclude that $ Q $ must also be true. This rule can be formally expressed as follows:\n\n1. $ P \rightarrow Q $ (If P, then Q)\n2. $ P $ (P is true)\n3. Therefore, $ Q $ (Q is true)\n\n### Example of Modus Ponens in Logical Reasoning\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). This can be expressed as $ P \rightarrow Q $.\n2. It is raining (P).\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can conclude:\n\n3. Therefore, the ground is wet (Q).\n\nThis example illustrates how Modus Ponens allows us to derive a conclusion based on the truth of a conditional statement and the affirmation of its antecedent. It is a powerful tool in logical reasoning and is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy to establish valid arguments.
