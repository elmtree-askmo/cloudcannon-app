answer: >-
    The resolution rule is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic that allows us to derive a conclusion from two disjunctions. It is particularly useful in automated theorem proving and logic programming. The rule can be formally stated as follows:\n\nIf we have two premises:\n1. $ P \lor Q $ (either $ P $ is true or $ Q $ is true)\n2. $ \neg P $ (not $ P $ is true)\n\nWe can conclude:\n3. $ Q $ (therefore, $ Q $ must be true)\n\nThis can be expressed in a more general form:\n- Given $ A \lor B $ and $ \neg A $, we can infer $ B $.\n\n### Example of Application\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n1. Premise 1: "I will either go to the park" (P) "or stay home" (Q). This can be represented as $ P \lor Q $.\n2. Premise 2: "I do not go to the park." This can be represented as $ \neg P $.\n\nUsing the resolution rule, we can derive the conclusion:\n- Conclusion: "I must be staying home." This can be represented as $ Q $.\n\nIn logical terms, the application of the resolution rule can be summarized as:\n1. $ P \lor Q $ (I will either go to the park or stay home)\n2. $ \neg P $ (I do not go to the park)\n3. Therefore, $ Q $ (I must be staying home)\n\nThis illustrates how the resolution rule can effectively simplify logical reasoning and lead to valid conclusions based on given premises.
