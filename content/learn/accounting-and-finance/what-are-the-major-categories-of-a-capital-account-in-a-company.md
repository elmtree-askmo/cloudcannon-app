    What are the major categories of a capital account in a company?
answer: >-
    In a company, the capital account primarily consists of two major categories:\n\n1. **Share Capital**: This represents the amount that shareholders have paid to the company in exchange for shares. It is also referred to as paid-up capital. Share capital includes only the amounts received from the initial issuance of shares. Any subsequent sales of shares occur between individuals and do not affect the company's capital account directly.\n\n2. **Retained Earnings**: This category reflects the accumulated profits that have been reinvested in the company rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. Retained earnings are crucial for funding future growth and operations without the need for external financing.\n\nTogether, these components form the equity section of a company's balance sheet, detailing the ownership interest of shareholders. For example, if a company has $200,000 in share capital and $50,000 in retained earnings, the total equity would be $250,000.\n\nThese categories are essential for understanding a company's financial health and its ability to finance operations and growth through internal resources.
