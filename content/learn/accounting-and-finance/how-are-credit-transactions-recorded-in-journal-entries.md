    How are credit transactions recorded in journal entries?
answer: >-
    In accounting, credit transactions are recorded in journal entries using the double-entry bookkeeping system. Each journal entry consists of a date, the accounts affected, the amounts debited and credited, and a brief description of the transaction. \n\nWhen a credit sale occurs, the following accounts are typically involved:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable**: This account is debited to reflect the amount owed by the customer.\n2. **Sales Revenue**: This account is credited to recognize the revenue earned from the sale.\n\nHere’s an example of how a journal entry for a credit sale might look:\n\n```\nDate: June 10  \nAccounts Receivable – Customer  $300  \nSales Revenue  $300\n```\n\nIn this example, the company has made a sale on credit, and thus, it records an increase in accounts receivable (an asset) and an increase in sales revenue (a revenue account).\n\nFor a more detailed view, a journal entry for a credit transaction can be structured as follows:\n\n| Date       | Particulars                     | Dr       | Cr       |\n|------------|----------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| June 10    | Accounts Receivable – Customer   | $300     |          |\n|            | Sales Revenue                    |          | $300     |\n\nThis format clearly shows the debit and credit amounts, ensuring that the accounting equation remains balanced, where total debits equal total credits.\n\nIn summary, credit transactions are recorded by debiting the accounts receivable and crediting the sales revenue, reflecting the increase in assets and revenue respectively.
