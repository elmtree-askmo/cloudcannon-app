    How is a listed entity defined in SEBI regulations?
answer: >-
    In the context of SEBI regulations, a "listed entity" is defined under Regulation 2(1)(p) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR). According to this regulation, a listed entity is an entity that has listed its designated securities on recognized stock exchange(s). This includes not only the securities issued directly by the entity but also those issued under schemes managed by it, in accordance with the listing agreement entered into between the entity and the recognized stock exchange(s).\n\nThe LODR regulations were introduced to enhance corporate governance practices among listed entities and ensure that they provide timely, accurate, and transparent disclosures to shareholders and other stakeholders. This regulatory framework aims to streamline the compliance obligations of listed entities, making it easier for them to adhere to corporate governance norms and improve transparency for investors.
