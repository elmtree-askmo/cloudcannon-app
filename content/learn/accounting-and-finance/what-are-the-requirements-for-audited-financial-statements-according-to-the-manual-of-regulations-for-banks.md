    What are the requirements for audited financial statements according to the Manual of Regulations for Banks?
answer: >-
    According to the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and the relevant provisions set forth by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the requirements for audited financial statements (AFS) include the following key points:\n\n1. **Compliance with PFRS/PAS**: The audited financial statements must be compliant with the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) and Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS). This compliance is mandatory for all banks and other BSP-supervised financial institutions (BSFIs) as emphasized in BSP Circular No. 494.\n\n2. **Submission Requirements**: Banks are required to submit their audited financial statements to the BSP, which should include the balance sheets, income statements, statements of changes in equity, statements of cash flows, and notes to the financial statements. These notes must disclose relevant information, such as the volume of past due loans.\n\n3. **Presentation of Financial Statements**: For banks with subsidiaries, the AFS should be presented both on a solo basis (parent) and on a consolidated basis (parent and subsidiaries). Additionally, complex banks with various business segments must disclose the financial results of these segments.\n\n4. **Management Report**: The management report, which accompanies the audited financial statements, must be signed by the chief executive officer of the bank. This report should satisfy the requirements specified in ยง 363.2(b) of the regulations.\n\n5. **Adjusting Entries**: Banks must submit adjusting entries that reconcile the balances in the financial statements for prudential reporting with those in the audited annual financial statements.\n\n6. **Annual Audit Requirement**: Insured depository institutions with $500 million or more in consolidated total assets are subject to annual audit and reporting requirements as mandated by Section 36 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and Part 363 of the FDIC's regulations.\n\nThese requirements ensure that the financial statements of banks are transparent, reliable, and in accordance with established accounting standards, thereby promoting trust and stability in the banking sector.
