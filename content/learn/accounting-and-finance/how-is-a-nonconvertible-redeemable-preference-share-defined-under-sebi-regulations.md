    How is a non-convertible redeemable preference share defined under SEBI regulations?
answer: >-
    Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations, specifically the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares) Regulations, 2013, a non-convertible redeemable preference share is defined as follows:\n\nA non-convertible redeemable preference share is a type of preference share that is redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 or the Companies Act, 2013. Importantly, it does not include any preference share that is convertible into or exchangeable with equity shares of the issuer at a later date, whether or not there is an option for the holder to do so.\n\nThis definition emphasizes that non-convertible redeemable preference shares are distinct from convertible preference shares, as they do not provide the option for conversion into equity shares, thereby serving as a fixed-income instrument for investors. The SEBI regulations provide a comprehensive framework for the public issuance and listing of these shares, facilitating companies in raising capital while ensuring regulatory compliance.
