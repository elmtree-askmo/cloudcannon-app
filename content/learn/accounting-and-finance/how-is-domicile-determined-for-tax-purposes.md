    How is domicile determined for tax purposes?
answer: >-
    Domicile for tax purposes is a critical concept that determines an individual's tax obligations in a particular jurisdiction. It is distinct from residency, which refers to where a person currently lives. Domicile is generally defined as the place that a person treats as their permanent home, and it can have significant implications for taxation, especially regarding worldwide income.\n\nIn Zambia, an individual is considered to be domiciled in the country if they treat it as their permanent home. This status affects how income is taxed, particularly for individuals with income sourced from outside Zambia. Domiciled individuals are liable for Zambian income tax on their worldwide income, regardless of whether that income is remitted to Zambia, unless specific exemptions apply.\n\nTo establish a new domicile, individuals must demonstrate that they have severed ties with their previous domicile. This often involves providing documentation that supports their claim of having moved their permanent home. Factors that may be considered in determining domicile include the location of an individual's primary residence, family connections, and the duration of stay in a particular location.\n\nIn summary, domicile is determined by the individual's intention to make a place their permanent home, and it plays a crucial role in establishing tax liabilities, particularly in relation to worldwide income.
