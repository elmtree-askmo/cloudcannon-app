    What are the disclosure requirements under SEBI Regulations, 2011?
answer: >-
    Under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, there are specific disclosure requirements that must be adhered to by acquirers and other stakeholders involved in the takeover process. These requirements are designed to ensure transparency and protect the interests of all parties involved, particularly minority shareholders. The key disclosure requirements can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Acquisition-Based Disclosure (Regulation 29)**: This regulation mandates disclosures related to the acquisition and disposal of shares and voting rights in target companies. Acquirers must disclose their holdings in various categories, including:\n   - The number of shares acquired or sold.\n   - The percentage of shares acquired or sold relative to the total shareholding.\n   - Any warrants, convertible securities, or other instruments that entitle the acquirer to receive shares carrying voting rights.\n\n2. **Continual Disclosure (Regulation 30)**: This regulation requires listed companies to make timely disclosures regarding material events or information that could affect the share price or the interests of shareholders. This includes any significant changes in the shareholding pattern or any events that could impact the company's operations.\n\n3. **Pre-Intimation for General Exemptions (Regulation 10)**: Before availing of certain exemptions under the regulations, acquirers must provide pre-intimation to SEBI. This is crucial for ensuring that the regulatory body is aware of the intended actions and can monitor compliance.\n\n4. **Open Offer Recommendations (Regulation 26)**: In the case of an open offer, the committee of independent directors must provide written recommendations to shareholders. These recommendations must be published at least two working days before the commencement of the tendering period and sent to SEBI, stock exchanges, and the manager to the open offer.\n\n5. **System Driven Disclosures**: SEBI has implemented a system for automated disclosures to enhance transparency and ease of compliance. This includes the automation of certain disclosure requirements to streamline the process for listed entities.\n\nThese disclosure requirements are part of SEBI's broader efforts to enhance corporate governance and protect minority shareholders in the Indian securities market. Compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring a fair and transparent takeover process.
