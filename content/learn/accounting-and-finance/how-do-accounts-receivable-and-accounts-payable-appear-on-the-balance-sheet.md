    How do accounts receivable and accounts payable appear on the balance sheet?
answer: >-
    Accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) are critical components of a company's balance sheet, representing opposite sides of financial transactions.\n\n### Accounts Receivable (AR)\n- **Classification**: Accounts receivable is classified as a **current asset** on the balance sheet. This classification indicates that the amounts owed to the company are expected to be collected within one year.\n- **Location on Balance Sheet**: You can find accounts receivable listed under the **current assets** section. This reflects the value of money that customers owe the company for goods or services provided on credit.\n- **Impact on Financial Statements**: When a sale is made on credit, it increases accounts receivable, which in turn affects the income statement by recognizing revenue. For example, if a company sells goods worth $100 on credit, it will record $100 in accounts receivable and recognize $100 in sales revenue.\n\n### Accounts Payable (AP)\n- **Classification**: Accounts payable is classified as a **current liability** on the balance sheet. This indicates that the company has obligations to pay its suppliers or vendors within one year.\n- **Location on Balance Sheet**: Accounts payable appears under the **current liabilities** section. This reflects the amounts the company owes for goods and services received but not yet paid for.\n- **Impact on Financial Statements**: When a company purchases goods or services on credit, it increases accounts payable. For instance, if a company receives an invoice for $200 for inventory purchased on credit, it will record $200 in accounts payable, reflecting the obligation to pay that amount in the future.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, accounts receivable and accounts payable are essential for understanding a company's liquidity and financial health. Accounts receivable represents money owed to the company (an asset), while accounts payable represents money the company owes to others (a liability). Both are crucial for assessing cash flow and overall financial stability.
