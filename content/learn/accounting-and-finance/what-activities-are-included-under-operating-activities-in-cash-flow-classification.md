    What activities are included under operating activities in cash flow classification?
answer: >-
    Operating activities in the cash flow classification encompass the principal revenue-producing activities of a business, along with other activities that do not fall under investing or financing activities. Specifically, operating activities include:\n\n1. **Cash Receipts from Sales**: This includes cash received from customers for goods sold or services rendered. For example, if a company receives $140,000 from customers, this amount is classified as cash inflow from operating activities.\n\n2. **Cash Payments to Suppliers**: This refers to cash outflows for purchasing goods and services necessary for the business operations. For instance, if a company pays $10,000 to suppliers, this is considered a cash outflow in operating activities.\n\n3. **Cash Payments for Operating Expenses**: This includes cash outflows for salaries, rent, utilities, and other operating expenses. For example, if a company pays $10,000 in salaries, this would also be included in the cash outflows from operating activities.\n\n4. **Other Cash Transactions Related to Core Operations**: Any other cash transactions that are part of the day-to-day operations of the business, such as cash received from royalties, fees, or commissions, are also included.\n\nThe net cash flow from operating activities is calculated by subtracting total cash payments from total cash receipts. For example, if a company has cash inflows of $140,000 and cash outflows of $10,000 for salaries, the net cash flow from operating activities would be $130,000.\n\nIn summary, operating activities are crucial as they reflect the cash generated or used in the core business operations, providing insights into the company's operational efficiency and profitability.
