    What role do auditor and attorney fees play in the issuance process?
answer: >-
    In the securities issuance process, particularly during an Initial Public Offering (IPO), auditor and attorney fees play significant roles in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining the integrity of financial reporting.\n\n1. **Auditor Fees**: Auditors are independent certified public accountants who examine a company's financial statements to ensure they are accurate, truthful, and compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates that publicly held companies submit audited financial statements as part of their registration statement. This audit provides an auditor's opinion, which is crucial for investor confidence and regulatory compliance. Auditor fees for IPO engagements typically range from $0.5 million to $1.2 million, depending on the complexity of the offering and the number of issues identified during the audit process. Notably, auditors tend to charge higher fees for IPO audits compared to post-IPO audits due to the increased scrutiny and responsibilities involved.\n\n2. **Attorney Fees**: Attorneys play a vital role in the securities issuance process by providing legal advice and ensuring compliance with securities laws. They assist in drafting the registration statement, preparing the final prospectus, and navigating the regulatory landscape. Legal fees can also vary significantly based on the complexity of the offering and the specific legal requirements involved. The audit committee of the company must approve all audit engagement fees, which underscores the importance of transparency and oversight in managing these costs.\n\nBoth auditor and attorney fees are considered consequential costs in the IPO process, alongside underwriting fees. These costs can increase significantly for companies facing additional complexities, such as regulatory scrutiny or unique business structures. Ultimately, the fees for auditors and attorneys are justified by the critical roles they play in ensuring that the financial information presented to investors is reliable and that the company adheres to all legal requirements, thereby fostering trust in the public securities markets.
