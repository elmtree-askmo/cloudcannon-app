    What financial powers does the Indian Parliament hold?
answer: >-
    The Indian Parliament holds significant financial powers, which are crucial for the governance and economic management of the country. Here are the key aspects of its financial powers:\n\n1. **Custodian of Public Money**: The Parliament is the custodian of public funds. The government cannot impose taxes or spend money without the approval of Parliament. This ensures that all financial activities are subject to legislative oversight.\n\n2. **Formulation and Approval of the Union Budget**: The Parliament plays a vital role in the formulation and approval of the Union Budget, which outlines the government's revenue and expenditure for the financial year. The budget must be presented to both houses of Parliament, and it is subject to debate and approval.\n\n3. **Money Bills**: According to Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, Money Bills, which pertain to taxation or government expenditure, can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can discuss and suggest amendments to these bills but cannot reject them. This provision ensures that the Lok Sabha has primacy in financial matters.\n\n4. **Financial Committees**: The Parliament has various financial committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee, which scrutinize government spending and financial performance. These committees play a crucial role in ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of public funds.\n\n5. **Key Constitutional Articles**: Articles 266 and 110 of the Constitution are particularly relevant to the financial functions of Parliament. Article 266 deals with the Consolidated Fund of India, while Article 110 defines the procedure for Money Bills.\n\n6. **Exclusive Powers of Lok Sabha**: The Lok Sabha has more power over financial matters compared to the Rajya Sabha. Once the Lok Sabha passes a budget or any financial legislation, the Rajya Sabha can only delay it for a maximum of 14 days or suggest amendments, which the Lok Sabha may or may not accept.\n\nIn summary, the financial powers of the Indian Parliament are extensive and are designed to ensure that the government remains accountable to the legislature, thereby safeguarding the interests of the public in financial matters.
