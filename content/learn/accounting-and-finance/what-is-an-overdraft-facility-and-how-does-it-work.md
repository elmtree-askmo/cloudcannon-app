    What is an overdraft facility and how does it work?
answer: >-
    An overdraft facility is a pre-arranged agreement with a bank that allows an account holder to withdraw more money than is available in their account, effectively allowing the account balance to go below zero. This facility is commonly linked to current accounts used by businesses, but it can also be available to individuals with savings accounts.\n\n### How It Works\nWhen an account holder's balance drops to zero, the overdraft facility activates, enabling them to continue making payments or withdrawals. The bank sets a specific overdraft limit, which is the maximum amount the account holder can overdraw. This facility can be utilized through various means, including cheques, ATM transactions, debit card payments, and automatic bill payments.\n\n### Interest and Fees\nThe account holder is charged interest only on the amount they utilize from the overdraft limit, not on the entire approved amount. Interest rates for overdrafts can vary between banks and are generally higher than those for traditional loans. Additionally, there may be fees associated with the overdraft facility, particularly if the account holder exceeds their limit or fails to repay the borrowed amount within a specified timeframe.\n\n### Advantages\n1. **Flexibility**: Overdrafts provide a flexible way to access funds when needed, allowing users to manage cash flow effectively.\n2. **Quick Access**: Overdraft facilities are typically easy to obtain, with minimal paperwork and quick approval processes.\n3. **Interest on Utilized Amount**: Interest is charged only on the amount overdrawn, making it potentially cheaper than a full loan for short-term needs.\n\n### Disadvantages\n1. **Higher Interest Rates**: Overdrafts often come with higher interest rates compared to other borrowing options, which can make them more expensive in the long run.\n2. **Low Borrowing Limits**: The amount available through an overdraft may be limited, which might not suffice for larger financial needs.\n3. **Potential Fees**: Exceeding the overdraft limit or failing to repay can result in additional fees.\n\nIn summary, an overdraft facility serves as a short-term credit option that can help individuals and businesses manage their finances more effectively, but it is essential to be aware of the associated costs and limitations.
