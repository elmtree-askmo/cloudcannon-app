    How does the process of listing specified securities through an IPO work in an IFSC?
answer: >-
    The process of listing specified securities through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), such as the GIFT IFSC in India, is governed by a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). Hereâ€™s an overview of how this process works:\n\n1. **Eligibility Criteria**: To be eligible for an IPO in an IFSC, companies must meet certain financial criteria. For instance, they should have an operating revenue of at least USD 20 million in the last financial year or averaged over the last three financial years, and a pre-tax profit of at least USD 1 million in the last financial year or averaged over the last three financial years, as per consolidated audited accounts.\n\n2. **Disclosure Requirements**: The issuer must ensure that there is true, correct, and adequate disclosure of material information in the offer document. This is crucial for enabling investors to make informed decisions.\n\n3. **Regulatory Framework**: The IFSCA has established the IFSCA (Issuance and Listing of Securities) Regulations, 2021, which provide detailed guidelines on the initial listing, disclosure requirements, and continuous listing obligations for companies looking to list their securities in the IFSC.\n\n4. **IPO Process**: The IPO process involves several steps, including the preparation of the offer document, obtaining necessary approvals, and making the offer to the public. The offer must be completed within 12 months from the date of issuance of observations by the IFSCA.\n\n5. **Types of Securities**: The IFSCA regulations allow for the listing of various types of securities, including equity instruments through IPOs, debt securities, and depository receipts. This flexibility is designed to attract a wide range of issuers.\n\n6. **Listing on Recognized Exchanges**: Companies can list their specified securities on recognized stock exchanges within the IFSC, such as the India International Exchange and NSE IFSC Limited. The IFSCA has streamlined the listing process to enhance the attractiveness of the IFSC for capital raising.\n\n7. **Fiscal Benefits**: Units operating in the IFSC may also enjoy various fiscal benefits, which can further incentivize companies to list their securities in this jurisdiction.\n\n8. **Future Directions**: The IFSCA continues to evolve its regulatory framework to align with international best practices and to facilitate a more efficient capital-raising environment for both Indian and foreign issuers.\n\nIn summary, the IPO process for listing specified securities in an IFSC is structured to ensure transparency, adequate disclosure, and compliance with regulatory standards, thereby fostering a robust financial market environment.
