answer: >-
    In Zambia, subscriptions and technical education expenses can be treated as tax-deductible expenses for sole traders, provided they meet certain criteria.\n\n### Subscriptions\nCertain types of subscriptions are deductible as business expenses. Specifically, subscriptions to professional, technical, medical, or trade journals and magazines that are directly related to the business can be claimed. This includes subscriptions to professional materials, such as software or other resources that are necessary for the operation of the business. The key requirement is that these subscriptions must be relevant to the business activities of the sole trader.\n\n### Technical Education Expenses\nTechnical education expenses are also generally deductible. For these expenses to qualify for deduction, they must be related to maintaining or improving skills that are necessary for the current business or profession. This means that if the education is mandated by the government or required by an employer to maintain a certain job status or salary, it can be deducted. However, expenses incurred for education that qualifies an individual for a new trade or business are not deductible.\n\n### Summary\nTo summarize, both subscriptions and technical education expenses can be treated as tax-deductible for sole traders in Zambia, as long as they are directly related to the business and meet the necessary criteria outlined in the Income Tax Act. It is advisable for sole traders to keep detailed records of these expenses to substantiate their claims during tax assessments.
