    What financial support is being provided for the development of Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget for the financial year 2024-25, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a significant financial package of ₹15,000 crore specifically allocated for the development of Amaravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh. This funding marks a crucial step in supporting the infrastructure and development needs of the state, especially since it is the first major financial assistance provided by the central government since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014.\n\nThe budget announcement not only emphasizes the commitment to Amaravati's development but also includes support for other key projects in the state, such as the Polavaram irrigation project, which is considered vital for the agricultural sector in Andhra Pradesh. Additionally, the budget aims to enhance industrial corridors and address the development of backward areas within the state.\n\nFurthermore, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have also agreed to provide a loan of ₹13,500 crore for the Amaravati development project, which will further bolster the financial resources available for this initiative. This combined financial support is expected to significantly accelerate the development of Amaravati as a modern capital city, addressing both infrastructure and institutional needs.
