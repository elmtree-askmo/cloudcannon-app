    What is unearned revenue, and how is it adjusted in financial statements?
answer: >-
    Unearned revenue, also known as deferred revenue, refers to money received by a business for goods or services that have not yet been delivered or performed. It is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet because it represents an obligation for the company to provide goods or services in the future.\n\n### Initial Recording of Unearned Revenue\nWhen a business receives payment in advance, it records the transaction as follows:\n\n1. **Debit Cash**: This increases the cash account, reflecting the receipt of payment.\n2. **Credit Unearned Revenue**: This increases the unearned revenue account, indicating the liability incurred by the business.\n\nFor example, if a company receives $1,000 for a service to be performed later, the journal entry would be:\n\n```plaintext\nDebit: Cash $1,000\nCredit: Unearned Revenue $1,000\n```\n\n### Transition to Earned Revenue\nOnce the service is performed or the goods are delivered, the unearned revenue is recognized as earned revenue. This is done by making the following journal entry:\n\n1. **Debit Unearned Revenue**: This decreases the unearned revenue account, reflecting that the obligation has been fulfilled.\n2. **Credit Revenue**: This increases the revenue account, recognizing the income earned from the service or goods provided.\n\nContinuing with the previous example, when the service is provided, the entry would be:\n\n```plaintext\nDebit: Unearned Revenue $1,000\nCredit: Revenue $1,000\n```\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\nUnearned revenue significantly impacts financial statements in the following ways:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - **Liability Recognition**: It is recorded as a current liability, reflecting the company's obligation to deliver goods or services in the future.\n   - **Impact on Assets and Equity**: While unearned revenue does not directly affect the asset side of the balance sheet, it can indirectly impact equity. As liabilities increase, the overall equity may appear lower until the revenue is earned and recognized.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - When the unearned revenue is recognized as earned, it appears on the income statement as revenue, contributing to the company's total income for the period.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The initial receipt of cash for unearned revenue is reflected in the cash flow from operating activities, indicating cash inflow before the revenue is recognized.\n\nThis process ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the company's obligations and revenue recognition in accordance with accrual accounting principles, adhering to the matching principle where revenues are recognized in the period they are earned.
