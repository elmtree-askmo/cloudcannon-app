    What are the key differences between investment banks and brokerage firms?
answer: >-
    The key differences between investment banks and brokerage firms can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Primary Function**:\n   - **Investment Banks**: These institutions engage in complex financial transactions and provide advisory services. They are primarily involved in underwriting and issuing securities for companies, facilitating mergers and acquisitions, and acting as financial advisors. Investment banks help companies raise capital by connecting them with investors and managing the issuance of stocks and bonds.\n   - **Brokerage Firms**: In contrast, brokerage firms act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of securities. Their main function is to facilitate the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments on behalf of clients. They provide investment advice and execute trades for individual and institutional investors.\n\n2. **Clientele**:\n   - **Investment Banks**: Typically work with larger companies, often those with annual revenues exceeding $10 million, and are involved in high-stakes transactions such as initial public offerings (IPOs) and large mergers.\n   - **Brokerage Firms**: Generally cater to a broader range of clients, including individual investors and smaller businesses, providing services that are more accessible to the general public.\n\n3. **Revenue Model**:\n   - **Investment Banks**: Often charge fees based on the size and complexity of the transactions they handle, such as a success fee that can range from 3-6% of the deal size, depending on the specifics of the transaction.\n   - **Brokerage Firms**: Typically earn commissions on trades executed on behalf of clients, which can range from 10-12% of the transaction value.\n\n4. **Services Offered**:\n   - **Investment Banks**: Offer a wide array of services including underwriting new stock issues, providing advisory services for mergers and acquisitions, and conducting due diligence on financial statements.\n   - **Brokerage Firms**: Focus on executing trades, providing market research, and offering investment advice to help clients make informed decisions.\n\n5. **Market Dynamics**:\n   - **Investment Banks**: Play a crucial role in capital markets by facilitating large financial transactions and helping companies navigate complex regulatory environments.\n   - **Brokerage Firms**: Contribute to market liquidity by enabling the buying and selling of securities, thus allowing investors to enter and exit positions efficiently.\n\nIn summary, while both investment banks and brokerage firms operate within the financial sector, they serve distinct roles and clientele, with investment banks focusing on large-scale financial transactions and advisory services, and brokerage firms concentrating on facilitating trades and providing investment advice.
