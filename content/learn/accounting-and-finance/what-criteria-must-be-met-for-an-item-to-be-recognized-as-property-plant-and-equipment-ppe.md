    What criteria must be met for an item to be recognized as property, plant, and equipment (PPE)?
answer: >-
    For an item to be recognized as Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE), it must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. **Probable Future Economic Benefits**: It must be probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits for the entity. This means that the asset is expected to contribute to the production of goods or services, thereby generating revenue.\n\n2. **Reliable Measurement of Cost**: The cost of the item must be measurable reliably. This includes not only the purchase price but also any directly attributable costs necessary to bring the asset to its intended location and condition for use. This can include:\n   - Purchase price, including import duties and any discounts or rebates.\n   - Directly attributable costs such as transportation, installation, and setup.\n   - Estimates of costs related to dismantling, removing the asset, or restoring the site after its use.\n\n3. **Long-term Use**: The asset should be used in the business for more than one accounting period. This aligns with the accounting period assumption, indicating that PPE is not intended for resale as part of normal operations.\n\n4. **Tangible Nature**: The asset must be a tangible asset, meaning it has physical substance. This includes items like machinery, buildings, and vehicles.\n\n5. **Not Held for Sale**: The asset should not be held for sale in the ordinary course of business. It must be used in the operations of the business rather than being part of inventory.\n\nIn summary, the recognition of PPE is contingent upon the expectation of future economic benefits, the ability to measure costs reliably, the asset's long-term use in the business, its tangible nature, and its classification as not being held for sale.
