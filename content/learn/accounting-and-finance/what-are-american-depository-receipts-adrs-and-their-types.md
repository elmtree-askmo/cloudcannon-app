    What are American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and their types?
answer: >-
    American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are financial instruments issued by U.S. banks that represent shares in foreign companies, allowing these shares to be traded on American stock exchanges. ADRs provide a convenient way for American investors to invest in non-U.S. companies without the complexities of dealing with foreign currencies or exchanges. They are denominated in U.S. dollars and pay dividends in the same currency, making them accessible to U.S. investors.\n\nADRs come in two primary types:\n\n1. **Sponsored ADRs**: These are issued with the cooperation of the foreign company. The foreign company enters into a legal agreement with a U.S. bank, which acts as the depositary. Sponsored ADRs typically provide more information and transparency about the foreign company, as the company is directly involved in the issuance process.\n\n2. **Unsponsored ADRs**: These are created without the direct involvement of the foreign company. A U.S. bank can issue unsponsored ADRs by purchasing shares on the foreign market and then issuing ADRs based on those shares. Unsponsored ADRs may have less information available to investors compared to sponsored ADRs, as the foreign company is not directly involved in the process.\n\nOverall, ADRs facilitate international investment by allowing U.S. investors to buy shares in foreign companies easily, thus broadening their investment opportunities.
