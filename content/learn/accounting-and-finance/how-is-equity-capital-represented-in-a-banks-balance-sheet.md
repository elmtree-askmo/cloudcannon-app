    How is equity capital represented in a bank's balance sheet?
answer: >-
    Equity capital in a bank's balance sheet is represented as the book value of shareholders' equity. It is a crucial component that reflects the residual interest in the bank's assets after all liabilities have been deducted. The balance sheet identity can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}\n$$\n\nIn this context, equity capital includes funds raised through the sale of equity, as well as retained earnings, which are profits that have been reinvested in the bank rather than distributed to shareholders. The equity section of the balance sheet typically includes various components such as:\n\n1. **Common Stock**: Represents the value of shares issued to shareholders.\n2. **Additional Paid-In Capital**: The amount received from shareholders above the par value of the stock.\n3. **Retained Earnings**: Accumulated profits that have not been distributed as dividends.\n4. **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**: Gains and losses that are not included in net income but affect equity.\n\nThe equity capital serves as a buffer against potential losses, supporting the bank's stability and growth. It is essential for assessing the bank's financial health and its ability to absorb losses, especially in fluctuating economic conditions. By analyzing the equity section, investors can gain insights into the bank's capitalization and risk management strategies.
