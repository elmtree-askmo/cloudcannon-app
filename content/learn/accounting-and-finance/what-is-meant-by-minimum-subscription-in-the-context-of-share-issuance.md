    What is meant by minimum subscription in the context of share issuance?
answer: >-
    Minimum subscription in the context of share issuance refers to the minimum amount of capital or the minimum number of shares that must be subscribed for by investors during an initial public offering (IPO) or a new share issue. This threshold is crucial as it ensures that the issuing company raises sufficient funds to meet its operational and preliminary requirements.\n\nCurrently, regulations stipulate that companies must achieve a minimum subscription of at least 90% of the total issue size. If this threshold is not met by the closure date of the offering, the company is obligated to refund the entire amount received from investors. This requirement is designed to prevent companies from proceeding with share allotments when they do not have adequate resources, thereby safeguarding investor interests and ensuring the financial viability of the company.\n\nIn summary, minimum subscription acts as a protective measure for both the company and its investors, ensuring that a new share issue is only valid if a significant portion of the shares is subscribed.
