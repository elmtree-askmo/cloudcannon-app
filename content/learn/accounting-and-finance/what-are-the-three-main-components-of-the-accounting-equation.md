    What are the three main components of the accounting equation?
answer: >-
    The three main components of the accounting equation are:\n\n1. **Assets**: These are the economic resources owned by a company that are expected to provide future economic benefits. Examples include cash, inventory, equipment, and property.\n\n2. **Liabilities**: These represent the company's debts and obligations to external parties. Common examples include loans, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.\n\n3. **Owner's Equity**: This is the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. It represents the owner's claim on the assets and can include items such as retained earnings and capital contributions.\n\nThe accounting equation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owner's Equity}\n$$\n\nThis equation illustrates the relationship between a company's resources (assets) and the claims against those resources (liabilities and owner's equity). It is fundamental to the double-entry accounting system, ensuring that the balance sheet remains balanced.
