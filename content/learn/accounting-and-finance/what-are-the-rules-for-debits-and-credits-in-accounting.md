    What are the rules for debits and credits in accounting?
answer: >-
    In accounting, the rules for debits and credits are fundamental to understanding how financial transactions are recorded. Here are the key principles:\n\n1. **Debits and Credits Defined**:\n   - A **debit** increases an asset or expense account and decreases a liability or equity account.\n   - A **credit** decreases an asset or expense account and increases a liability or equity account.\n\n2. **Account Types**:\n   - **Assets**: Debits increase asset accounts (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable), while credits decrease them.\n   - **Liabilities**: Debits decrease liability accounts (e.g., Accounts Payable, Unearned Revenue), while credits increase them.\n   - **Equity**: Debits decrease equity accounts (e.g., Common Stock, Retained Earnings), while credits increase them.\n   - **Expenses**: Debits increase expense accounts (e.g., Rent Expense, Wages Expense), while credits decrease them.\n   - **Revenue**: Debits decrease revenue accounts (e.g., Sales Revenue), while credits increase them.\n\n3. **T Accounts**:\n   - T accounts are used to visually represent the debits and credits for each account. The left side of the T account represents debits, and the right side represents credits. This helps in organizing and tracking financial transactions.\n\n4. **Example of a Transaction**:\n   - When a company pays rent, it would:\n     - Debit the Rent Expense account (increasing expenses).\n     - Credit the Cash account (decreasing assets).\n\n5. **Double-Entry Accounting**:\n   - Every financial transaction affects at least two accounts, ensuring that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced. This is the essence of double-entry accounting.\n\nUnderstanding these rules is crucial for accurate financial reporting and analysis, as they form the basis for recording all transactions in the accounting system.
