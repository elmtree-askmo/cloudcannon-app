    What are the characteristics of equity shares?
answer: >-
    Equity shares, also known as ordinary shares or common stock, represent ownership in a company and come with several key characteristics that make them a popular choice for investors. Here are the primary characteristics of equity shares:\n\n1. **Ownership Stake**: Equity shares signify ownership in a company. Shareholders who hold these shares are considered partial owners of the business, and the extent of their ownership is proportionate to the number of equity shares they hold relative to the total outstanding shares.\n\n2. **Permanent Capital**: Equity shares are a permanent source of capital for the company. They are non-redeemable in nature, meaning that they do not have a maturity date and can only be redeemed if the company decides to buy back shares or liquidate.\n\n3. **Residual Income**: Shareholders are entitled to a share of the company's profits, which are distributed as dividends. However, dividends are not guaranteed and can vary based on the company's performance and decisions made by the board of directors.\n\n4. **Voting Rights**: Equity shareholders typically have voting rights, allowing them to participate in important company decisions, such as electing the board of directors and approving major corporate policies.\n\n5. **Claim on Assets**: In the event of liquidation, equity shareholders have a claim on the company's assets after all debts and obligations have been settled. This means they are last in line to receive any remaining assets, making equity shares riskier than debt instruments.\n\n6. **Limited Liability**: Shareholders have limited liability, meaning they are only liable for the company's debts up to the amount they invested in the shares. Their personal assets are protected from the company's creditors.\n\n7. **Transferability**: Equity shares are generally transferable, allowing shareholders to buy and sell their shares in the stock market, providing liquidity to their investment.\n\n8. **Volatility and Risk**: Equity shares can be subject to significant price fluctuations, making them a higher-risk investment compared to fixed-income securities. The potential for high returns is accompanied by the risk of loss.\n\n9. **No Collateral Requirement**: Companies do not need to offer collateral when issuing equity shares, making it easier for firms without substantial assets to raise capital.\n\nThese characteristics make equity shares a fundamental component of a company's capital structure and an attractive investment option for those looking to participate in the growth and profitability of a business.
