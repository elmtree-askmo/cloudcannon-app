    What is the process by which Visa calculates interest on purchases?
answer: >-
    Visa calculates interest on purchases using a method known as the Average Daily Balance. This process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Daily Interest Rate Calculation**: First, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of the credit card is converted into a daily interest rate. This is done by dividing the APR by 365 (the number of days in a year). For example, if the APR is 18%, the daily interest rate would be approximately $0.0493\%$ (which is $18\% / 365$).\n\n2. **Average Daily Balance**: Throughout the billing cycle, Visa tracks the balance on your credit card each day. The Average Daily Balance is calculated by adding up the balance for each day of the billing cycle and then dividing that total by the number of days in the cycle.\n\n3. **Interest Calculation**: The interest charged for the billing period is then calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Credit Card Interest} = \text{Average Daily Balance} \times \text{Daily Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Days in Billing Cycle}\n   $$\n   This means that if you carry a balance from month to month, the interest you incur compounds daily, as the interest charged one day becomes part of the balance that accrues interest the next day.\n\n4. **Compounding Effect**: Since interest is compounded daily, it can lead to a significant increase in the total amount owed if the balance is not paid off in full by the due date. This is particularly important for consumers to understand, as it highlights the cost of carrying a balance on their credit cards.\n\nBy understanding this process, consumers can better manage their credit card usage and avoid excessive interest charges.
