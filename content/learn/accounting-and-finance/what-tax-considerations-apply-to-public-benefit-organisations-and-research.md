    What tax considerations apply to public benefit organisations and research?
answer: >-
    Public Benefit Organisations (PBOs) in Zambia are subject to specific tax considerations that are important for their operation and compliance. Here are the key points regarding the taxation of PBOs:\n\n1. **Tax Exemption Status**: PBOs are not automatically exempt from income tax. To qualify for tax exemption, they must be specifically approved by the Minister of Finance. This means that simply being a non-profit organization or registered as a non-governmental organization (NGO) does not guarantee tax-exempt status.\n\n2. **Definition of PBOs**: According to the Income Tax Act (ITA), a Public Benefit Organisation is defined as an organization that engages in activities deemed beneficial to the public. The criteria for what constitutes a public benefit activity are outlined in the Tenth Schedule of the Income Tax Act, and additional activities may be determined by the Minister.\n\n3. **Tax Benefits**: The Zambian government provides tax benefits to assist PBOs in supplementing their financial resources. These benefits are designed to create an enabling environment for PBOs to fulfill their social and developmental roles, which can relieve some of the financial burdens on the state.\n\n4. **Tax Rates**: PBOs may be subject to various tax rates depending on their activities. For instance, income from farming and agro-processing may be taxed at 15%, while other forms of income, such as royalties to non-residents, may incur a final tax of 20%. Interest on Treasury Bills is also subject to a final tax for exempt organizations.\n\n5. **Compliance and Regulations**: PBOs must adhere to the regulations set forth in the Customs and Excise (Public Benefit Organisation) (Rebate, Refund or Remission) Regulations, which outline the specific compliance requirements for these organizations.\n\n6. **Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) Act**: The ZDA Act of 2006 offers various incentives that may apply to PBOs, further supporting their operations and financial sustainability.\n\nIn summary, while PBOs in Zambia can benefit from tax exemptions and incentives, they must navigate a complex regulatory environment and seek specific approval for tax-exempt status. Understanding these considerations is crucial for PBOs to ensure compliance and optimize their financial resources.
