    What role does the Public Accounts Committee play in parliamentary oversight?
answer: >-
    The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) plays a crucial role in parliamentary oversight by ensuring government accountability regarding public finances. Its primary functions include:\n\n1. **Examination of Financial Accounts**: The PAC scrutinizes the accounts that detail how public funds, granted by Parliament, have been spent by the government. This includes reviewing the annual Finance Accounts and other relevant financial documents.\n\n2. **Review of Audit Reports**: The PAC examines the annual audit reports prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) or equivalent auditing bodies. This process helps in assessing the appropriateness of government expenditures and the adherence to financial regulations.\n\n3. **Questioning Officials**: The committee has the authority to invite ministers, permanent secretaries, and other ministry officials to provide explanations regarding financial transactions and decisions. This questioning process is vital for transparency and accountability.\n\n4. **Reporting Findings**: After conducting its examinations and inquiries, the PAC reports its findings to Parliament. The government is typically required to respond to the PAC's recommendations within a specified timeframe, ensuring that issues raised are addressed.\n\n5. **Promoting Financial Discipline**: The PAC also discusses points of financial discipline and principles, contributing to the establishment of better financial management practices within government entities.\n\nOverall, the PAC serves as a key mechanism for enhancing government accountability, promoting good governance, and ensuring that public funds are utilized effectively and responsibly. Its work is essential for maintaining public trust in government financial management.
