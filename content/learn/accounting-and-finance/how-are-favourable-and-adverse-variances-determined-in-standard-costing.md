    How are favourable and adverse variances determined in standard costing?
answer: >-
    In standard costing, variances are determined by comparing actual costs incurred to the predetermined standard costs. These variances can be classified as either favorable or adverse based on the relationship between actual performance and the budgeted expectations.\n\n1. **Favorable Variances**: A favorable variance occurs when actual costs are less than standard costs, or when actual revenues exceed budgeted revenues. This indicates that the business has performed better than expected. For example, if the standard cost for raw materials is set at £100,000, but the actual cost is only £90,000, the variance is favorable by £10,000. Similarly, if a company generates more revenue than anticipated, this would also result in a favorable variance.\n\n2. **Adverse Variances**: Conversely, an adverse variance arises when actual costs exceed standard costs, or when actual revenues fall short of budgeted revenues. This indicates poorer performance than expected. For instance, if the budgeted cost for raw materials is £100,000, but the actual cost rises to £120,000, the variance is adverse by £20,000. This situation reflects higher costs than planned or lower revenue than expected.\n\nTo summarize, the determination of favorable and adverse variances is based on the comparison of actual figures against standard figures. If the actual results are better than the standards, the variance is favorable; if they are worse, the variance is adverse. This analysis is crucial for businesses to identify areas for improvement and to manage costs effectively.
