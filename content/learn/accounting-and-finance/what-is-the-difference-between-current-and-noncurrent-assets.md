    What is the difference between current and non-current assets?
answer: >-
    The difference between current and non-current assets lies primarily in their liquidity and the time frame in which they are expected to be converted into cash or utilized.\n\n1. **Current Assets**: These are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year or within the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. Current assets are essential for managing day-to-day operations and meeting short-term financial obligations. Examples of current assets include:\n   - Cash and cash equivalents\n   - Accounts receivable\n   - Inventory\n   - Short-term investments\n   - Prepaid expenses\n\n2. **Non-Current Assets**: Also known as long-term assets, these are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year. Non-current assets are typically used in the operations of the business over a longer period and are essential for long-term financial health. Examples of non-current assets include:\n   - Property, plant, and equipment (e.g., buildings, machinery)\n   - Long-term investments\n   - Intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks)\n   - Goodwill\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is the time frame: current assets are short-term resources expected to be liquidated or used within a year, while non-current assets are long-term investments that provide value over multiple years. Understanding this classification is crucial for assessing a company's liquidity and overall financial stability.
