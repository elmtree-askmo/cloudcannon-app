    What are the main objectives of an investment policy?
answer: >-
    The main objectives of an investment policy are to provide a clear framework for managing an investment portfolio, ensuring that both the investor and the portfolio manager are aligned in their goals and strategies. Here are the key objectives typically outlined in an investment policy statement (IPS):\n\n1. **Define Investment Goals**: The IPS articulates the specific financial goals and objectives of the investor, which may include capital appreciation, income generation, or capital preservation. This helps in setting a clear direction for the investment strategy.\n\n2. **Establish Risk Tolerance**: It outlines the investor's risk tolerance, which is crucial for determining the appropriate asset allocation and investment strategies. Understanding risk tolerance helps in balancing potential returns with acceptable levels of risk.\n\n3. **Asset Allocation Guidelines**: The policy specifies the target asset allocation, detailing the proportion of investments in various asset classes (e.g., equities, fixed income, real estate) to achieve the desired risk-return profile.\n\n4. **Performance Benchmarks**: The IPS sets performance benchmarks against which the investment portfolio's performance can be measured. This allows for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of the investment strategy as needed.\n\n5. **Investment Restrictions and Guidelines**: It may include specific restrictions on certain types of investments or strategies, ensuring that the portfolio aligns with the investor's values or regulatory requirements.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Evaluation Procedures**: The policy outlines how the portfolio will be monitored and evaluated over time, including the frequency of reviews and the criteria for making adjustments to the investment strategy.\n\n7. **Roles and Responsibilities**: The IPS defines the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in managing the investment portfolio, including the investor, financial advisor, and any third-party managers. This clarity helps in maintaining accountability and effective communication.\n\n8. **Adaptability and Review**: A well-structured IPS allows for periodic reviews and adjustments to reflect changes in the investor's circumstances, market conditions, or investment goals, ensuring that the investment strategy remains relevant and effective.\n\nIn summary, the primary objectives of an investment policy are to provide a structured approach to investment management, align the interests of all parties involved, and facilitate informed decision-making throughout the investment process.
