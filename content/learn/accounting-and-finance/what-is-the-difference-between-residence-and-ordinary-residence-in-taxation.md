    What is the difference between residence and ordinary residence in taxation?
answer: >-
    In taxation, the terms "residence" and "ordinary residence" have distinct meanings that can significantly affect an individual's tax obligations.\n\n1. **Residence**: This generally refers to the physical presence of an individual in a particular country for a specified period. For example, in Zambia, an individual is considered a resident if they are present in the country for 183 days or more during a charge year. Residents are typically taxed on their worldwide income, meaning they must report and pay taxes on income earned both domestically and internationally.\n\n2. **Ordinary Residence**: This concept goes beyond mere physical presence and considers the individual's habitual or permanent home. An ordinarily resident individual is someone who has a significant and ongoing connection to a country, indicating that they intend to reside there on a long-term basis. In many jurisdictions, including Zambia, being ordinarily resident can lead to different tax implications, particularly concerning the taxation of foreign income and the availability of certain tax reliefs.\n\nIn summary, while "residence" focuses on the duration of physical presence, "ordinary residence" encompasses a broader understanding of an individual's ties to a country, influencing their overall tax liability. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for compliance with tax laws and for effective tax planning.
