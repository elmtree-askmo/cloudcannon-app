    What distinguishes current liabilities from long-term liabilities?
answer: >-
    Current liabilities and long-term liabilities are two distinct categories of obligations that a business owes to external parties, and they are differentiated primarily by the time frame in which they are due.\n\n1. **Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that a company expects to settle within one year or within its operating cycle, whichever is longer. Current liabilities typically include items such as:\n   - Accounts payable (money owed to suppliers)\n   - Short-term loans or lines of credit\n   - Accrued expenses (expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid)\n   - Current portions of long-term debt (the portion of long-term debt that is due within the next year)\n\n   For example, if a company has accounts payable of $50,000 and short-term loans of $30,000, these amounts are classified as current liabilities because they are expected to be settled within the year.\n\n2. **Long-term Liabilities**: These are obligations that are due beyond one year. Long-term liabilities are typically associated with financing activities and may include:\n   - Bonds payable\n   - Long-term loans\n   - Deferred tax liabilities\n   - Lease obligations that extend beyond one year\n\n   For instance, if a company has a loan of $100,000 that is due in five years, this amount is recorded as a long-term liability.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction between current and long-term liabilities lies in their due dates: current liabilities are due within one year, while long-term liabilities are due after one year. Understanding this classification is essential for evaluating a company's liquidity and financial stability.
