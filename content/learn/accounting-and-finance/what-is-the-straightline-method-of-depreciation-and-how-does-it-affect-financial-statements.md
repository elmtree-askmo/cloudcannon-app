    The straight-line method of depreciation is a widely used accounting technique for allocating the cost of a tangible asset evenly over its useful life. This method is straightforward and easy to apply, making it a popular choice among businesses.\n\n### Calculation of Straight-Line Depreciation\n\nThe formula for calculating annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method is:\n\n$$\n\text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- **Cost** is the initial purchase price of the asset.\n- **Salvage Value** is the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life.\n- **Useful Life** is the period over which the asset is expected to be used.\n\n**Example:**\nIf a company purchases a machine for $10,000, expects it to have a salvage value of $1,000, and estimates its useful life to be 5 years, the annual depreciation expense would be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{10,000 - 1,000}{5} = \frac{9,000}{5} = 1,800\n$$\n\nThus, the company would record a depreciation expense of $1,800 each year for five years.\n\n### Impact on Financial Statements\n\n1. **Income Statement:**\n   - The annual depreciation expense reduces the net income of the company. This is because depreciation is considered an operating expense. For example, if a company has a net income of $50,000 before accounting for depreciation, the net income after accounting for the $1,800 depreciation expense would be $48,200.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet:**\n   - The asset's book value is reduced by the accumulated depreciation. Using the previous example, after one year, the book value of the machine would be:\n   $$\n   \text{Book Value} = \text{Cost} - \text{Accumulated Depreciation} = 10,000 - 1,800 = 8,200\n   $$\n   This reduction in asset value reflects the wear and tear on the asset over time.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - While depreciation is a non-cash expense (it does not involve an actual cash outflow), it is added back to net income in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. This is because it reduces taxable income, thus affecting cash flows indirectly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe straight-line method of depreciation provides a systematic way to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life, impacting both the income statement and the balance sheet. It ensures that the financial statements reflect the asset's declining value and the associated expense, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting and analysis.
