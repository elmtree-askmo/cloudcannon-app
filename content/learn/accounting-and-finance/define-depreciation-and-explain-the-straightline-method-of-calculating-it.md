    Define depreciation and explain the straight-line method of calculating it.
answer: >-
    Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. This accounting method reflects the wear and tear of an asset over time, allowing businesses to match the cost of the asset with the revenues it generates. \n\n### Straight-Line Method of Depreciation\n\nThe straight-line method is one of the simplest and most commonly used methods for calculating depreciation. Under this method, the annual depreciation expense is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, subtracting its estimated salvage value (the value at the end of its useful life), and dividing the result by the asset's useful life in years. The formula for straight-line depreciation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost of Asset} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}\n$$\n\n#### Example Calculation\n\nFor instance, if a company purchases equipment for $26,000 with a useful life of 5 years and an estimated salvage value of $8,000, the annual depreciation expense would be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Cost of Asset**: $26,000\n2. **Salvage Value**: $8,000\n3. **Useful Life**: 5 years\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n$$\n\text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{26,000 - 8,000}{5} = \frac{18,000}{5} = 3,600\n$$\n\nThus, the company would record an annual depreciation expense of $3,600 for the equipment over its useful life.\n\n### Accumulated Depreciation\n\nAs depreciation is recorded each year, it accumulates in a contra asset account known as accumulated depreciation. This account reflects the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized against the asset since its acquisition. For example, after three years, the accumulated depreciation for the equipment in the example above would be:\n\n$$\n\text{Accumulated Depreciation} = 3 \times 3,600 = 10,800\n$$\n\nThis accumulated depreciation reduces the book value of the asset on the balance sheet, providing a more accurate representation of its current value.
