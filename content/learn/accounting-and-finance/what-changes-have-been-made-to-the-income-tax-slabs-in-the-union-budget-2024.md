    What changes have been made to the income tax slabs in the Union Budget 2024?
answer: >-
    The Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant changes to the income tax slabs, aimed at simplifying the tax structure and providing relief to taxpayers. Here are the key updates regarding the income tax slabs:\n\n1. **Revised Income Tax Slabs**: The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, announced adjustments to the income tax slabs under the new tax regime. This is part of a broader effort to create a more streamlined and taxpayer-friendly tax system.\n\n2. **Increased Standard Deduction**: The standard deduction limit has been increased to Rs 75,000, which allows the salaried class to save up to Rs 17,500 in taxes under the new regime.\n\n3. **Abolition of Angel Tax**: The budget also includes the abolition of the angel tax for all classes of investors, which is intended to facilitate easier capital raising for startups and address concerns that the tax was a barrier to investment.\n\n4. **Impact on Taxpayers**: These changes are expected to provide significant relief to individuals, particularly those in the middle-income bracket, by reducing their overall tax burden.\n\nOverall, the revisions in the income tax slabs and the increase in standard deductions reflect the government's commitment to enhancing the financial well-being of taxpayers while supporting economic growth.
