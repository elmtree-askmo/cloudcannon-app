answer: >-
    A letter of credit (LC) operates as a financial instrument issued by a bank that guarantees payment to a seller (beneficiary) on behalf of a buyer (applicant) under specific conditions. The mechanics of how a letter of credit functions can be broken down into several key steps:\n\n1. **Issuance**: The process begins when the buyer applies for a letter of credit from their bank (the issuing bank). The buyer must provide details about the transaction, including the amount, the beneficiary's information, and the terms and conditions that must be met for payment.\n\n2. **Notification**: Once the issuing bank approves the application, it issues the letter of credit and sends it to the seller's bank (the advising bank). This document serves as a guarantee that the seller will receive payment as long as they comply with the terms outlined in the letter.\n\n3. **Document Presentation**: The seller then ships the goods or provides the services as per the agreement. After fulfilling their obligations, the seller presents the required documents (such as shipping documents, invoices, and insurance certificates) to the advising bank. These documents must match the conditions specified in the letter of credit.\n\n4. **Verification**: The advising bank reviews the documents to ensure they comply with the terms of the letter of credit. If everything is in order, the advising bank forwards the documents to the issuing bank for further verification.\n\n5. **Payment**: Upon successful verification, the issuing bank releases the payment to the advising bank, which then pays the seller. This payment is made either immediately (in the case of a sight letter of credit) or at a later date (in the case of a term or usance letter of credit).\n\n6. **Reimbursement**: Finally, the issuing bank seeks reimbursement from the buyer, who is responsible for repaying the bank according to the terms of their agreement.\n\nLetters of credit can be revocable or irrevocable. An irrevocable letter of credit cannot be changed or canceled without the consent of all parties involved, providing greater security to the seller. In contrast, a revocable letter of credit can be modified or canceled by the issuing bank without the beneficiary's consent.\n\nOverall, letters of credit play a crucial role in international trade by minimizing credit risk and ensuring that sellers receive payment as long as they meet the specified conditions, thus fostering trust between parties who may not know each other personally or operate under different legal systems.
