    How did the personal income tax schedule change on January 1, 2018, under the TRAIN Law?
answer: >-
    On January 1, 2018, the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law introduced significant changes to the personal income tax schedule in the Philippines. The key changes included:\n\n1. **Exemption Threshold**: Individuals earning below ₱250,000 annually were exempted from paying personal income tax. This marked a substantial increase from the previous exemption levels.\n\n2. **New Tax Rates**: The TRAIN Law established a new progressive tax rate structure for individuals earning above ₱250,000. The tax rates for this income bracket were set as follows:\n   - For annual income between ₱250,000 and ₱2,000,000, the tax rate is 20% of the excess over ₱250,000.\n   - For annual income between ₱2,000,001 and ₱8,000,000, the tax rate is ₱350,000 plus 25% of the excess over ₱2,000,000.\n   - For annual income exceeding ₱8,000,000, the tax rate is ₱1,450,000 plus 30% of the excess over ₱8,000,000.\n\n3. **Personal Exemptions**: The previous personal exemption of ₱50,000 and additional exemptions (up to ₱100,000 for dependents) were removed under the new tax structure, leading to a more streamlined tax system.\n\n4. **Impact on Self-Employed and Professionals**: Self-employed individuals and professionals were also affected by these changes, as they were now subject to the same progressive tax rates as salaried employees. They had the option to choose between the graduated income tax rates or an 8% flat tax on gross sales or receipts exceeding ₱250,000.\n\nOverall, the implementation of the TRAIN Law aimed to simplify the tax system, promote fairness, and increase take-home pay for many taxpayers in the Philippines.
