    How are gifts and entertainment expenses treated for tax purposes?
answer: >-
    In Zambia, the tax treatment of gifts and entertainment expenses is governed by specific regulations outlined in the Income Tax Act. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how these expenses are treated for tax purposes:\n\n### Gifts\n1. **Business Gifts**: Sole traders can deduct the costs of business gifts given in the course of their trade or business, but there are limitations. Specifically, the deduction is capped at ZMW 25 for gifts given to each individual during the tax year. If both a sole trader and their spouse give gifts to the same person, the combined deduction cannot exceed this limit.\n\n### Entertainment Expenses\n1. **General Rule**: Entertainment expenses, which include costs associated with activities generally considered to provide amusement or recreation, are typically nondeductible. This means that even if there is a business connection to the expense, it cannot be deducted unless it falls under specific exceptions.\n\n2. **Exceptions**: There are certain exceptions where entertainment expenses may be partially deductible. For instance, meals that are directly associated with business activities may be subject to a 50% disallowance rule, meaning that only half of the meal costs can be deducted.\n\n3. **Staff Gifts**: When it comes to gifts for employees, there are specific rules regarding the fringe benefits tax (FBT). If the total cost of non-entertainment gifts (such as gift vouchers or hampers) given to staff in a quarter (e.g., October to December) is less than ZMW 300, these may be exempt from FBT.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, while gifts to clients and customers can be partially deducted with a limit, entertainment expenses are generally nondeductible unless they meet specific criteria. Sole traders should carefully document these expenses and consult the Income Tax Act for any updates or changes to the regulations.
