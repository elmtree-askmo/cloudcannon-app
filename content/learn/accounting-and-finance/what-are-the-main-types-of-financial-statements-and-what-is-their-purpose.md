    What are the main types of financial statements, and what is their purpose?
answer: >-
    The main types of financial statements are essential tools for assessing a company's financial health, performance, and cash flow. The four primary financial statements are:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)**:\n   - **Purpose**: The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. It helps stakeholders understand the company's financial position, including its liquidity and solvency. By analyzing the balance sheet, users can assess the company's ability to meet its short-term and long-term obligations.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - **Purpose**: The income statement outlines a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period. It provides insights into the company's profitability by showing how much money is made (revenues) and how much is spent (expenses). This statement helps stakeholders evaluate the company's operational performance and identify key drivers of profit or loss.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - **Purpose**: The cash flow statement details the inflows and outflows of cash within a company over a specific period. It is divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. This statement is crucial for understanding the company's liquidity and cash management, as it shows how well the company generates cash to meet its obligations.\n\n4. **Statement of Changes in Equity**:\n   - **Purpose**: This statement explains the changes in a company's equity throughout a specific period. It includes information on new investments, dividends paid, and retained earnings. By analyzing this statement, stakeholders can understand how the company's equity has evolved and the factors contributing to these changes.\n\nThese financial statements collectively provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial performance and position, enabling stakeholders to make informed economic decisions.
