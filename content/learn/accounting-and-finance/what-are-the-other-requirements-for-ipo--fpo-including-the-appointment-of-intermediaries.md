answer: >-
    To successfully launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a Further Public Offering (FPO) in India, companies must adhere to a series of requirements and regulations set forth by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and other relevant authorities. Here are the key requirements, including the appointment of intermediaries:\n\n### 1. **Appointment of Intermediaries**\n   - Companies must appoint various intermediaries to facilitate the IPO or FPO process. These typically include:\n     - **Merchant Bankers**: Responsible for managing the issue, including pricing, marketing, and compliance with regulatory requirements.\n     - **Book Runners**: Help in the allocation of shares and managing the order book.\n     - **Registrars**: Handle the processing of applications and maintain records of shareholders.\n     - **Underwriters**: Provide assurance to the issuer that the shares will be sold, often taking on the risk of unsold shares.\n\n### 2. **Regulatory Compliance**\n   - Companies must comply with the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, which outline the necessary disclosures and compliance requirements for both IPOs and FPOs.\n   - This includes filing a draft prospectus with SEBI, which must be approved before the public offering can proceed.\n\n### 3. **Documentation Requirements**\n   - A comprehensive prospectus must be prepared, detailing the company's financials, business model, risk factors, and use of proceeds from the offering.\n   - Other documentation may include:\n     - Financial statements for the past three years.\n     - Legal opinions and compliance certificates.\n     - KYC (Know Your Customer) documentation for investors.\n\n### 4. **Eligibility Criteria**\n   - Companies must meet specific eligibility criteria to launch an IPO or FPO, which may include minimum paid-up capital requirements and a track record of profitability, depending on whether it is a Main Board or SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) IPO.\n\n### 5. **Disclosure Requirements**\n   - Companies are required to provide detailed disclosures in the prospectus, including financial performance, management discussion, and analysis, as well as any material changes in the business.\n\n### 6. **Roadshows and Investor Presentations**\n   - After obtaining SEBI approval, companies typically conduct roadshows and investor presentations to generate interest and gauge demand for the offering.\n\n### 7. **Timelines**\n   - The entire process from filing the draft prospectus to the actual listing can take approximately 4-6 months, depending on the complexity of the offering and regulatory approvals.\n\n### 8. **Post-Issue Compliance**\n   - After the IPO or FPO, companies must adhere to ongoing compliance requirements as stipulated by SEBI and the stock exchanges, including periodic disclosures and corporate governance norms.\n\nIn summary, the process of launching an IPO or FPO involves a structured approach that includes the appointment of various intermediaries, adherence to regulatory requirements, comprehensive documentation, and ongoing compliance post-offering. Understanding these requirements is crucial for companies looking to access capital markets effectively.
