answer: >-
    In the Philippines, the powers and authorities of commercial banks differ significantly from those of universal banks, primarily due to the broader scope of activities permitted for universal banks.\n\n### Universal Banks\nUniversal banks (UBs) are authorized to engage in a wide range of financial services beyond traditional banking. In addition to commercial banking activities, universal banks can:\n\n1. **Underwrite Securities**: They can issue and underwrite stocks and bonds.\n2. **Engage in Investment Banking**: Universal banks can provide investment banking services, including mergers and acquisitions advisory.\n3. **Offer Insurance Services**: They are allowed to engage in insurance activities, either directly or through subsidiaries.\n4. **Trust Services**: Universal banks can act as trustees and provide trust services.\n5. **Investment Management**: They can manage investment funds and portfolios.\n\nThis extensive range of services allows universal banks to cater to a diverse clientele and engage in more complex financial transactions.\n\n### Commercial Banks\nOn the other hand, commercial banks (KBs) have a more limited scope of authority. Their primary functions include:\n\n1. **Accepting Deposits**: They can take savings and time deposits, as well as current/checking accounts.\n2. **Providing Loans**: Commercial banks primarily extend loans to individuals and businesses.\n3. **Basic Financial Services**: They offer standard banking services such as payment processing and fund transfers.\n\nWhile commercial banks can engage in various banking activities, they do not have the same level of authority to engage in investment banking, underwriting, or insurance services as universal banks do.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the breadth of services offered. Universal banks have a more extensive range of powers, allowing them to operate in multiple financial sectors, while commercial banks focus primarily on traditional banking services. This distinction is crucial for understanding the roles these banks play in the Philippine financial system.
