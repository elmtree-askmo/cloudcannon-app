    How do Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) differ from other depository receipts?
answer: >-
    Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) are a specific type of financial instrument that allows Indian investors to invest in foreign companies through the Indian stock market. They are similar to American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), but there are key differences that set IDRs apart from these other depository receipts.\n\n1. **Issuance and Trading Location**: IDRs are issued by a domestic depository registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and are traded on Indian stock exchanges. In contrast, ADRs are issued by U.S. depository banks and traded on U.S. exchanges, while GDRs are issued by international depository banks and can be traded on multiple international markets.\n\n2. **Denomination**: IDRs are denominated in Indian rupees, making them accessible to Indian investors without the need for currency conversion. ADRs are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, and GDRs can be denominated in either U.S. dollars or euros.\n\n3. **Underlying Assets**: IDRs represent ownership of shares in foreign companies, similar to ADRs and GDRs. However, the underlying shares for IDRs are held by a domestic depository in India, while ADRs and GDRs are backed by shares held in foreign depositories.\n\n4. **Regulatory Framework**: The issuance and regulation of IDRs are governed by SEBI, which has specific rules and guidelines for their operation. ADRs and GDRs are subject to the regulations of their respective countries, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ADRs.\n\n5. **Market Access**: IDRs provide Indian investors with a direct avenue to invest in foreign companies without needing to access international markets directly. This is particularly significant for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with international assets.\n\nIn summary, while IDRs share similarities with ADRs and GDRs, they are distinct in terms of their issuance, trading location, denomination, regulatory framework, and the specific market access they provide to Indian investors.
