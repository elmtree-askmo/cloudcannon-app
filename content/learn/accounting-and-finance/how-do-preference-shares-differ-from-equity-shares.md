    How do preference shares differ from equity shares?
answer: >-
    Preference shares and equity shares are two distinct types of shares that companies issue to raise capital, and they differ in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Ownership and Voting Rights**:\n   - **Equity Shares**: Also known as common shares, equity shares represent ownership in a company and provide shareholders with voting rights. This means equity shareholders can participate in corporate decisions, such as electing the board of directors.\n   - **Preference Shares**: Preference shares typically do not carry voting rights. They are designed to provide a fixed return to shareholders without granting them a say in company management.\n\n2. **Dividends**:\n   - **Equity Shares**: Dividends on equity shares are not fixed and depend on the company's performance. They can fluctuate based on the company's profitability and are paid after preference shareholders have received their dividends.\n   - **Preference Shares**: Preference shares come with a fixed dividend rate, which means that preference shareholders receive a predetermined amount before any dividends are distributed to equity shareholders. This provides a more stable income stream for preference shareholders.\n\n3. **Priority in Liquidation**:\n   - **Equity Shares**: In the event of liquidation, equity shareholders have a residual claim on the company's assets, meaning they are paid after all debts and preference shareholders have been settled.\n   - **Preference Shares**: Preference shareholders have a higher claim on assets than equity shareholders during liquidation. They are paid out before equity shareholders, which reduces their risk in case of company insolvency.\n\n4. **Risk and Return**:\n   - **Equity Shares**: These shares are generally considered riskier due to their dependence on company performance for dividends and capital appreciation. However, they also offer the potential for higher returns.\n   - **Preference Shares**: Preference shares are viewed as less risky compared to equity shares because of their fixed dividends and priority in liquidation. However, they typically offer lower potential returns than equity shares.\n\n5. **Types**:\n   - **Equity Shares**: There are no subcategories; they are simply common shares.\n   - **Preference Shares**: These can be further classified into various types, such as cumulative, non-cumulative, convertible, and non-convertible preference shares, each with different features regarding dividends and conversion rights.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between preference shares and equity shares lie in ownership rights, dividend payments, priority in liquidation, risk levels, and potential returns. Understanding these differences is crucial for investors when making decisions about their investment portfolios.
