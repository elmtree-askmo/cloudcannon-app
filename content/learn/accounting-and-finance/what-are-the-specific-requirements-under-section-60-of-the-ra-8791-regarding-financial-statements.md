    What are the specific requirements under Section 60 of the RA 8791 regarding financial statements?
answer: >-
    Under Section 60 of Republic Act No. 8791, also known as the General Banking Law of 2000, every bank, quasi-bank, or trust entity is required to submit financial statements to the appropriate supervising and examining department of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The specific requirements include:\n\n1. **Form and Frequency**: The financial statements must be submitted in a form and frequency as prescribed by the BSP. This means that the BSP has the authority to determine how often these statements should be submitted and in what format.\n\n2. **Specific Date**: The financial statements must be as of a specific date, ensuring that the information provided is relevant and timely.\n\nThese requirements are part of the broader regulatory framework aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in the financial operations of banking institutions in the Philippines. Compliance with these regulations is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the banking system and protecting the interests of depositors and stakeholders.
