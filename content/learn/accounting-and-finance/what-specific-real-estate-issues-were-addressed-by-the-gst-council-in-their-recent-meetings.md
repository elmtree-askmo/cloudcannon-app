    What specific real estate issues were addressed by the GST Council in their recent meetings?
answer: >-
    The recent meetings of the GST Council have addressed several specific real estate issues, particularly focusing on tax implications and regulatory clarifications. Here are the key points discussed:\n\n1. **Exemption for RERA**: In the latest meeting held on October 7, 2023, the GST Council is likely to clarify that the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) will not be required to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST). This decision is expected to benefit the real estate sector, developers, and homebuyers by alleviating some of the tax burdens associated with regulatory compliance.\n\n2. **Input Tax Credit (ITC) Issues**: There have been ongoing discussions regarding the Input Tax Credit (ITC) in the residential real estate sector. Currently, ITC is not permissible for certain services, which has raised concerns among developers and stakeholders in the industry.\n\n3. **Valuation Rules**: The 53rd GST Council meeting recommended amendments to valuation rules retrospectively to clarify issues regarding valuation between related parties. This is particularly relevant for developers who face challenges related to the GST paid on development rights, which has been denied under the presumption of being part of blocked credit.\n\n4. **Group of Ministers (GoM)**: The formation of a Group of Ministers to boost the real estate sector under the GST regime was recommended during the 32nd meeting. However, there have been delays in the GoM's meetings, which are crucial for forming comprehensive reports and recommendations for the Council.\n\n5. **Rate Changes**: The GST Council has made various clarifications regarding tax slab rates and procedural changes that impact the real estate sector. These changes aim to streamline the tax structure and enhance transparency in the sector.\n\nOverall, the GST Council's recent meetings have focused on addressing the complexities and challenges faced by the real estate sector under the GST regime, with an emphasis on regulatory clarity and tax relief measures.
