    What are the main sources of taxable income in Zambia?
answer: >-
    In Zambia, the main sources of taxable income include:\n\n1. **Employment Income**: Salaries and wages earned by individuals are subject to income tax. Zambian residents are liable to pay income tax on their worldwide income, which includes employment earnings.\n\n2. **Business Profits**: Income generated from business activities, including sole traders and companies, is taxable. The Zambia Revenue Authority levies corporate tax at a standard rate of 35%, with reduced rates for specific sectors such as agriculture and non-traditional exports, which are taxed at 15%.\n\n3. **Rental Income**: As of January 1, 2022, rental income is taxed through a turnover tax system, which is set at a rate of 0% for gross income below a certain threshold.\n\n4. **Interest and Dividends**: Zambian-source interest income is subject to withholding tax (WHT), which is often considered the final tax for residents. Non-residents are also subject to WHT on Zambian-source dividends, typically at a rate of 20%.\n\n5. **Capital Gains**: While Zambia does not impose a capital gains tax, any profits from the sale of property or assets may be subject to other forms of taxation depending on the nature of the transaction.\n\n6. **Withholding Taxes**: Various forms of income, such as payments to non-residents, are subject to withholding taxes, which can include interest, dividends, and royalties.\n\nOverall, the Zambian tax system operates on a source-based principle, meaning that income deemed to be from a Zambian source is generally subject to Zambian income tax, regardless of the residency status of the taxpayer.
