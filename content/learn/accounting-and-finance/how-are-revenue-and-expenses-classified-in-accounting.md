    How are revenue and expenses classified in accounting?
answer: >-
    In accounting, revenue and expenses are classified based on their nature and the role they play in the financial performance of a business. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how they are classified:\n\n### Revenue Classification\n1. **Operating Revenue**: This is the income generated from the primary activities of the business, such as sales of goods or services. For example, a retail store earns operating revenue from selling merchandise.\n\n2. **Non-Operating Revenue**: This includes income from secondary activities that are not part of the core business operations, such as interest income, dividends, or gains from the sale of assets.\n\n3. **Recognition Principle**: Revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when cash is received. This is a key aspect of accrual accounting, which states that revenue should be recorded when the service is performed or the product is delivered.\n\n### Expense Classification\n1. **Operating Expenses**: These are the costs incurred in the normal course of business operations. They include:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by a company.\n   - **Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)**: Indirect costs such as salaries, rent, utilities, and marketing expenses.\n\n2. **Non-Operating Expenses**: These are costs not directly tied to the core business operations, such as interest expenses or losses from the sale of assets.\n\n3. **Recognition Principle**: Expenses are recognized when they are incurred, not necessarily when they are paid. For instance, if a company incurs a utility expense in December but pays it in January, the expense is recorded in December.\n\n### Summary\nThe classification of revenue and expenses is crucial for accurate financial reporting and analysis. It helps stakeholders understand the financial health of a business, assess profitability, and make informed decisions. The principles of revenue and expense recognition ensure that financial statements reflect the true economic activities of the business during a specific period.\n\nThis classification is essential for preparing financial statements, which provide insights into a company's performance and financial position.
