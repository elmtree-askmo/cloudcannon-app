    How are irrecoverable debts handled in tax computations?
answer: >-
    In the context of Zambian tax law, irrecoverable debts, commonly referred to as bad debts, can be handled in tax computations under specific conditions. According to the Income Tax Act of Zambia, bad debts that are written off can be deducted for income tax purposes if they meet the following criteria:\n\n1. **Due to the Taxpayer**: The debt must be owed to the taxpayer.\n2. **Previously Included in Income**: The debt must have been included in the taxpayer's income for the current year or any of the previous years of assessment.\n3. **Proven Irrecoverable**: The taxpayer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the debt is irrecoverable. This typically requires the taxpayer to show that they have exhausted all reasonable recovery measures.\n\nTo substantiate a claim for bad debt relief, the taxpayer is required to provide evidence that all recovery efforts have been made and that the amount is indeed irrecoverable. This process ensures that only genuine bad debts are deducted, preventing abuse of the tax system.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that the maximum amount deductible for bad debts is subject to the approval of the Commissioner-General, and there may be specific provisions that apply to different types of businesses, such as banks, which may have unique considerations regarding loans written off.\n\nIn summary, irrecoverable debts can be deducted in Zambian tax computations if they are properly documented and meet the legal requirements set forth in the Income Tax Act.
