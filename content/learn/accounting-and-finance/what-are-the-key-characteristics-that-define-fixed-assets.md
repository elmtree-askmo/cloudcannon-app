    What are the key characteristics that define fixed assets?
answer: >-
    Fixed assets are defined by several key characteristics that distinguish them from other types of assets. Here are the primary characteristics that define fixed assets:\n\n1. **Long-term Nature**: Fixed assets are intended for long-term use in the operations of a business. They are not meant for resale in the ordinary course of business and are expected to provide economic benefits over multiple accounting periods.\n\n2. **Tangible Assets**: Fixed assets are typically tangible in nature, meaning they have a physical presence. Examples include buildings, machinery, vehicles, and equipment. However, some intangible assets, like patents or trademarks, can also be considered fixed assets if they provide long-term benefits.\n\n3. **Depreciation**: The value of fixed assets is reduced over time through a process called depreciation. This accounting method allocates the cost of the asset over its useful life, reflecting the wear and tear or obsolescence of the asset. Fixed assets are recorded on the balance sheet at their historical cost, and accumulated depreciation is deducted to show their net book value.\n\n4. **Capital Expenditure**: The acquisition of fixed assets typically involves capital expenditures (CapEx), which are investments made to purchase or improve long-term assets. These expenditures are recorded as assets on the balance sheet rather than expenses on the income statement.\n\n5. **Economic Benefits**: Fixed assets are expected to generate future economic benefits for the business. This can be through direct revenue generation or by enhancing operational efficiency.\n\n6. **Not Intended for Sale**: Unlike inventory, fixed assets are not intended for sale in the normal course of business operations. They are used to support the business's ongoing activities.\n\n7. **Recognition and Measurement**: Fixed assets must be recognized and measured according to accounting standards. This includes determining their initial cost, useful life, and residual value, which are essential for calculating depreciation.\n\n8. **Examples**: Common examples of fixed assets include:\n   - Buildings and structures\n   - Machinery and equipment\n   - Vehicles\n   - Furniture and fixtures\n   - Land (not depreciated)\n\nThese characteristics collectively define fixed assets and highlight their importance in the financial statements and overall operations of a business.
