    How is the amount of tax payable determined?
answer: >-
    The amount of tax payable in Zambia is determined based on several factors, primarily governed by the Income Tax Act. Here are the key components that influence the calculation of tax liability:\n\n1. **Source of Income**: Zambia employs a source-based taxation system, meaning that income derived from Zambian sources is subject to Zambian income tax. This includes all forms of remuneration from employment, regardless of where the payment is made or the payer's residence. Zambian residents are also taxed on interest and dividends from foreign sources.\n\n2. **Taxable Income**: For individual taxpayers, taxable income includes all earnings exceeding ZMW 57,600 per annum, excluding income subject to the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system. Those earning above this threshold must submit a provisional tax return and make advance payments based on their estimated tax liability.\n\n3. **Tax Rates and Brackets**: The tax payable is calculated using progressive tax rates that apply to different income brackets. The Zambia Revenue Authority provides a PAYE calculator on its website, which can be used to determine tax obligations based on annual salary or other income types. The calculator is updated with the latest tax rates and brackets, making it a useful tool for taxpayers.\n\n4. **Marginal Tax Rate**: This refers to the rate applied to the next unit of income earned. It reflects the progressive nature of the tax system, where higher income levels are taxed at higher rates.\n\n5. **Deductions and Exemptions**: Certain deductions and exemptions may apply, which can reduce the overall taxable income. For instance, specific expenses related to employment or business operations may be deductible.\n\n6. **Penalties and Interest**: If tax payments are not made by the due dates, penalties and interest may be applied, increasing the total amount payable.\n\n7. **Calculation Example**: For instance, if an employee has a gross pay of K 15,000 per month, the tax will be calculated based on the applicable tax tables for that month, considering any deductions or exemptions.\n\nIn summary, the amount of tax payable in Zambia is determined by the individual's taxable income, applicable tax rates, and any deductions or exemptions, along with compliance with filing and payment deadlines. For precise calculations, taxpayers are encouraged to use the PAYE calculator or consult a tax professional.
