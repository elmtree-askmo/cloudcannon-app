    What is the risk-free rate and how is it defined?
answer: >-
    The risk-free rate is defined as the theoretical rate of return on an investment that carries zero risk. It represents the return an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specific period of time. In practice, the risk-free rate serves as a benchmark for comparing the potential returns of different investments and is a critical component of various financial models, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\n\nTypically, the risk-free rate is associated with government bonds, particularly those issued by stable governments, such as U.S. Treasuries, which are considered to have negligible default risk. The risk-free rate is important in financial modeling, investing, and valuations, as it provides a baseline rate against which the returns of riskier investments can be measured. \n\nIn summary, the risk-free rate is a fundamental concept in finance, representing the minimum expected yield that investors should demand for taking on little or no risk.
