    What is electric charge, and how does Coulomb's Law describe the interaction between charges?
answer: >-
    Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. It is denoted by the symbol $ Q $ and is measured in coulombs (C). Electric charge can be classified into two types: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.\n\nThe mathematical relationship that describes the interaction between electric charges is known as Coulomb's Law. This law states that the electrostatic force $ F $ between two point charges $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $ is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $ d $ between them. The formula for Coulomb's Law is expressed as:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{|Q_1 \cdot Q_2|}{d^2}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ F $ is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the two charges,\n- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $ in a vacuum,\n- $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $ are the amounts of charge on the two objects,\n- $ d $ is the distance between the centers of the two charges.\n\nCoulomb's Law quantitatively describes how electric charges interact, providing essential insights into electrostatic forces and the behavior of charged particles in various physical scenarios.
