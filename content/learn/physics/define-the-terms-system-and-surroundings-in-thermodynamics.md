    Define the terms 'system' and 'surroundings' in thermodynamics.
answer: >-
    In thermodynamics, the terms 'system' and 'surroundings' are fundamental concepts used to define the scope of analysis for thermodynamic processes.\n\n1. **System**: A thermodynamic system is a specific portion of the universe that is chosen for analysis. It can be defined as a matter or region with well-defined boundaries that separate it from its surroundings. The system can be classified into three types based on the transfer of mass and energy:\n   - **Closed System**: No mass transfer occurs across the boundary, but energy can be exchanged.\n   - **Open System**: Both mass and energy can be exchanged with the surroundings.\n   - **Isolated System**: Neither mass nor energy can be exchanged with the surroundings.\n\n2. **Surroundings**: The surroundings refer to everything external to the system that can interact with it. This includes any matter, energy, or influences that may affect the system's properties and behavior. The surroundings play a crucial role in energy transfers and thermodynamic processes, impacting factors such as temperature, pressure, and phase changes within the system.\n\nTogether, the system and surroundings form what is referred to as the "universe" in thermodynamic analysis. Understanding the relationship between the system and its surroundings is essential for analyzing energy exchanges and thermodynamic processes effectively.
