    What distinguishes ohmic conductors from non-ohmic conductors?
answer: >-
    Ohmic conductors and non-ohmic conductors are distinguished primarily by their relationship between voltage and current, as well as their resistance characteristics.\n\n1. **Ohmic Conductors**:\n   - **Linear Relationship**: Ohmic conductors follow Ohm's Law, which states that the current ($I$) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage ($V$) applied across it. This relationship can be expressed as $V = IR$, where $R$ is the constant resistance.\n   - **Constant Resistance**: The resistance of ohmic conductors remains constant over a wide range of applied voltages and currents. This predictability makes them ideal for many electrical circuits. Common examples include metals like copper and aluminum, which are often used as connecting wires in electrical systems.\n\n2. **Non-Ohmic Conductors**:\n   - **Nonlinear Relationship**: Non-ohmic conductors do not follow Ohm's Law. Their voltage-current relationship is nonlinear, meaning that the resistance can change with varying voltage or current. This deviation from Ohm's Law indicates that the resistance is not constant.\n   - **Variable Resistance**: The resistance in non-ohmic conductors can change due to factors such as temperature, material properties, or the specific conditions under which they operate. For example, in a filament lamp, the resistance increases significantly as the filament heats up. Other examples of non-ohmic conductors include diodes, transistors, and thermistors, which are used in various applications like rectification, amplification, and temperature sensing.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction lies in the linearity of the voltage-current relationship and the constancy of resistance: ohmic conductors maintain a constant resistance and a linear relationship, while non-ohmic conductors exhibit variable resistance and a nonlinear relationship.
