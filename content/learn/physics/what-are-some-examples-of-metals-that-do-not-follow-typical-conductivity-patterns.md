answer: >-
    Some examples of metals that do not follow typical conductivity patterns are referred to as "strange metals." These unusual metals exhibit electrical behavior that defies the conventional rules of electricity. For instance, in ordinary metals like iron and copper, the resistance typically increases with the square of the temperature. However, strange metals demonstrate a different current-carrying ability, suggesting that the mechanisms behind their conductivity do not resemble those of electrons.\n\nResearch led by physicists, including Aavishkar Patel from the Flatiron Institute, has indicated that the electrical charge fluctuations in these strange metals may be indicative of a new quantum phenomenon. This behavior has been observed in experiments where radioactive gamma rays were fired at these metals, revealing their unique electrical characteristics.\n\nWhile specific examples of strange metals were not provided in the gathered information, the term generally encompasses a class of materials that challenge the established understanding of metallic conductivity. The study of these materials is significant as it may lead to the discovery of new materials with high-temperature superconductivity, which is a precursor state to superconductivity.\n\nIn summary, strange metals represent a fascinating area of research in materials science, showcasing conductivity behaviors that diverge from traditional metallic properties.
