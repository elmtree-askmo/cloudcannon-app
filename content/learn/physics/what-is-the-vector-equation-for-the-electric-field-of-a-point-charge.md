    What is the vector equation for the electric field of a point charge?
answer: >-
    The vector equation for the electric field $\vec{E}$ created by a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ from the charge can be expressed using Coulomb's law. The electric field vector is given by:\n\n$$\n\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2} \hat{r}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, approximately equal to $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2$.\n- $Q$ is the magnitude of the point charge.\n- $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being measured.\n- $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point of interest. The direction of $\hat{r}$ is outward from the charge if $Q$ is positive and inward toward the charge if $Q$ is negative.\n\nThis equation describes how the electric field strength decreases with the square of the distance from the charge and indicates the direction of the field based on the sign of the charge.
