answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, is a fundamental principle in classical physics that describes the gravitational attraction between two masses. Mathematically, it can be expressed with the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two objects,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation states that the gravitational force $ F $ is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that as the distance $ r $ increases, the gravitational force decreases rapidly, following the inverse square law.\n\nNewton's formulation of this law was revolutionary as it provided a mathematical framework to explain not only the motion of objects on Earth but also celestial phenomena, such as the orbits of planets and moons. It established a connection between terrestrial and celestial mechanics, allowing for the prediction of gravitational interactions in a wide range of scenarios.\n\nIn practical applications, this law can be used to calculate the gravitational force between any two objects, such as the Earth and an object on its surface, or between two planets. For example, if we consider the Earth (mass $ m_1 = 5.98 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} $) and a person (mass $ m_2 = 70 \, \text{kg} $) standing on its surface, with the radius of the Earth $ r \approx 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} $, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the gravitational force acting on the person.\n\nThis law has profound implications in physics, leading to the development of further theories, including Einstein's General Relativity, which expands upon Newton's ideas in the context of spacetime and gravity. However, for many practical purposes, Newton's Law of Gravitation remains a cornerstone of classical physics.
