    Can you explain Newton's Law of Gravitation in mathematical terms?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, is a fundamental principle in classical physics that describes the gravitational attraction between two masses. Mathematically, it can be expressed with the following formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation indicates that the gravitational force $ F $ is directly proportional to the product of the two masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $ r $ between them. This means that as the masses increase, the gravitational force increases, and as the distance between the masses increases, the gravitational force decreases.\n\nNewton's formulation of this law was revolutionary as it provided a mathematical framework to explain not only the motion of objects on Earth but also celestial phenomena, such as the orbits of planets and moons. It unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics under a single theory, which was a significant advancement in the understanding of the physical universe.\n\nIn practical applications, this law allows us to calculate the gravitational force acting on objects, such as determining the weight of an object on Earth, which is the force of Earth's gravity acting on it. For example, if we have two masses, say $ m_1 = 30 \, \text{kg} $ and $ m_2 = 50 \, \text{kg} $, separated by a distance of $ r = 4 \, \text{m} $, we can calculate the gravitational force between them using the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{30 \times 50}{4^2} = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \frac{1500}{16} \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 93.75 \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N}\n$$\n\nThis illustrates how Newton's Law of Gravitation can be applied to real-world scenarios, demonstrating the relationship between mass, distance, and gravitational force.
