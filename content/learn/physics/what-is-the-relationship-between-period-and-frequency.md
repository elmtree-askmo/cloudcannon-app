    What is the relationship between period and frequency?
answer: >-
    The relationship between period and frequency is fundamental in the study of periodic functions and wave phenomena. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nf = \frac{1}{T}\n$$\n\nand conversely,\n\n$$\nT = \frac{1}{f}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ f $ is the frequency, measured in hertz (Hz), which represents the number of cycles per second.\n- $ T $ is the period, measured in seconds (s), which is the time taken for one complete cycle of the wave.\n\nThis relationship indicates that frequency and period are inversely related. As the frequency of a wave increases, the period decreases, and vice versa. For example, if a wave has a frequency of 50 Hz, its period can be calculated as:\n\n$$\nT = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02 \text{ seconds}\n$$\n\nThis means that it takes 0.02 seconds for one complete cycle of the wave to occur. Understanding this relationship is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and signal processing, as it allows for the interchangeability of frequency and period in describing wave behavior.
