    How does visible light fit into the electromagnetic spectrum?
answer: >-
    Visible light is a small but significant portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which encompasses all types of electromagnetic radiation. The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm, with violet light at the lower end and red light at the upper end. This range corresponds to frequencies of about 430 terahertz (THz) to 790 THz.\n\nVisible light is unique because it is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be detected by the human eye, allowing us to perceive colors. Each color corresponds to a different wavelength, with shorter wavelengths appearing as blue and violet, and longer wavelengths appearing as red. The visible spectrum is situated between infrared radiation, which has longer wavelengths, and ultraviolet radiation, which has shorter wavelengths.\n\nIn the broader context of the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light is positioned roughly in the middle, with radio waves on the low-frequency end and gamma rays on the high-frequency end. The entire electromagnetic spectrum includes various types of radiation, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, each with distinct properties and applications.\n\nOverall, while visible light constitutes only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum, it plays a crucial role in human perception and various technological applications, such as photography, lighting, and communication technologies like Visible Light Communication (VLC).
