    What distinguishes dilatant fluids from pseudoplastic fluids?
answer: >-
    Dilatant fluids and pseudoplastic fluids are both types of non-Newtonian fluids, but they exhibit distinctly different behaviors in response to shear stress.\n\n1. **Dilatant Fluids**:\n   - **Viscosity Behavior**: The viscosity of dilatant fluids increases with an increase in shear rate. This means that as the fluid is stirred or subjected to stress, it becomes thicker and more resistant to flow.\n   - **Power Law Index**: In the context of the Power Law equation, dilatant fluids have an exponent $ n > 1 $. This indicates that the shear stress increases more than linearly with the shear rate.\n   - **Examples**: Common examples of dilatant fluids include certain types of cornstarch suspensions and some slurries.\n\n2. **Pseudoplastic Fluids**:\n   - **Viscosity Behavior**: In contrast, pseudoplastic fluids exhibit a decrease in viscosity with an increase in shear rate. This means that they become thinner and flow more easily when subjected to stress.\n   - **Power Law Index**: For pseudoplastic fluids, the exponent $ n < 1 $ in the Power Law equation indicates that the shear stress increases less than linearly with the shear rate.\n   - **Examples**: Examples of pseudoplastic fluids include ketchup, paint, and many polymer solutions.\n\n### Summary of Differences:\n- **Response to Shear Rate**: \n  - Dilatant fluids become thicker (viscosity increases) with increased shear.\n  - Pseudoplastic fluids become thinner (viscosity decreases) with increased shear.\n  \n- **Power Law Index**:\n  - Dilatant: $ n > 1 $\n  - Pseudoplastic: $ n < 1 $\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial in processing applications, such as extrusion and injection molding, where the flow behavior of materials can significantly affect the final product quality.
