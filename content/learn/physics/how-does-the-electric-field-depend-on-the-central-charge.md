    How does the electric field depend on the central charge?
answer: >-
    The electric field generated by a point charge is fundamentally dependent on two key factors: the magnitude of the charge itself, denoted as $Q$, and the distance from the charge, denoted as $r$. The relationship can be expressed mathematically by the formula:\n\n$$\nE = k \frac{|Q|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $E$ is the electric field strength, $k$ is Coulomb's constant (approximately $8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$), and $|Q|$ is the absolute value of the charge. \n\nFrom this equation, we can observe that:\n\n1. **Magnitude of Charge**: The electric field strength $E$ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge $Q$. This means that as the charge increases, the electric field strength also increases. Conversely, if the charge decreases, the electric field strength diminishes.\n\n2. **Distance from Charge**: The electric field strength $E$ is inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r$ from the charge. This inverse square relationship indicates that as one moves further away from the charge, the strength of the electric field decreases rapidly. Specifically, if the distance is doubled, the electric field strength becomes one-fourth of its original value.\n\nAdditionally, the direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the charge: it points away from positive charges and toward negative charges. This directional aspect is crucial when considering the net electric field in systems with multiple charges, as the superposition principle applies.\n\nIn summary, the electric field depends on the central charge $Q$ in a way that it increases with greater charge and decreases with increased distance from the charge, following the inverse square law.
