    What are the differences in malleability and ductility between metals and non-metals?
answer: >-
    The differences in malleability and ductility between metals and non-metals are significant and stem from their distinct physical properties.\n\n**Malleability** refers to the ability of a material to deform under compressive stress, allowing it to be shaped into thin sheets without breaking. Most metals are highly malleable; for example, gold is known to be the most malleable metal, capable of being hammered into extremely thin sheets. This property is due to the metallic bonds in metals, which allow layers of atoms to slide over each other without breaking the overall structure.\n\n**Ductility**, on the other hand, is the ability of a material to deform under tensile stress, meaning it can be stretched into wires. Metals are generally ductile, allowing them to be drawn into wires without fracturing. This is also a result of the metallic bonding, which provides flexibility in the atomic structure.\n\nIn contrast, non-metals are typically brittle and lack both malleability and ductility. When subjected to stress, non-metals tend to break or shatter rather than deform. For instance, materials like sulfur and phosphorus are non-metallic and exhibit these brittle characteristics.\n\nIn summary, while metals are characterized by their malleability and ductility, allowing them to be shaped and stretched, non-metals are generally brittle and do not possess these properties. This fundamental difference is crucial in applications across engineering and materials science, where the choice of material depends on the required mechanical properties.
