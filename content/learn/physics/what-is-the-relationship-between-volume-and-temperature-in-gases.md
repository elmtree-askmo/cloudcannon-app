    What is the relationship between volume and temperature in gases?
answer: >-
    The relationship between volume and temperature in gases is primarily described by Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (measured in kelvins) when the pressure is held constant. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\n\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}\n$$\n\nwhere $ V_1 $ and $ T_1 $ are the initial volume and temperature, and $ V_2 $ and $ T_2 $ are the final volume and temperature, respectively.\n\nAccording to Charles's Law, as the temperature of a gas increases, its volume also increases, provided that the pressure remains constant. Conversely, if the temperature decreases, the volume will also decrease. This relationship can be visualized graphically, where a plot of volume versus temperature at constant pressure yields a straight line, indicating a linear relationship.\n\nFor example, if a gas occupies a volume of 221 cm³ at a temperature of 0 °C (273 K), and the temperature is increased to 100 °C (373 K), the new volume can be calculated using Charles's Law. The formula can be rearranged to find the final volume $ V_2 $:\n\n$$\nV_2 = V_1 \times \frac{T_2}{T_1}\n$$\n\nThis relationship is crucial in understanding the behavior of gases in various applications, such as weather balloons, which expand as they rise into regions of lower atmospheric pressure, leading to an increase in volume due to the decrease in external pressure and the increase in temperature.\n\nIn summary, Charles's Law illustrates that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is constant, highlighting the fundamental principles governing gas behavior.
