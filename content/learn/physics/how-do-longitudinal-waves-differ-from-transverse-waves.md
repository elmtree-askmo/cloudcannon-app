    How do longitudinal waves differ from transverse waves?
answer: >-
    Longitudinal waves and transverse waves are two fundamental types of mechanical waves that differ primarily in the direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of wave propagation.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Longitudinal Waves**: In longitudinal waves, the particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave's travel. This results in areas of compression (where particles are close together) and rarefaction (where particles are spread apart). A common example of longitudinal waves is sound waves.\n   - **Transverse Waves**: In contrast, transverse waves have particles that move perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. This creates crests (the highest points) and troughs (the lowest points) as the wave propagates. Light waves are a prime example of transverse waves.\n\n2. **Parts**:\n   - Longitudinal waves consist of compressions and rarefactions.\n   - Transverse waves consist of crests and troughs.\n\n3. **Medium Requirement**:\n   - Longitudinal waves require a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) for propagation, as they involve the oscillation of particles within that medium.\n   - Transverse waves can also travel through solids and liquids, but electromagnetic waves (a type of transverse wave) can propagate through a vacuum, which is not possible for longitudinal waves.\n\n4. **Oscillation Direction**:\n   - In longitudinal waves, the displacement of particles occurs in the same direction as the wave travels.\n   - In transverse waves, the displacement of particles occurs at right angles to the direction of wave travel.\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   - Longitudinal waves: Sound waves, seismic P-waves.\n   - Transverse waves: Light waves, seismic S-waves.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the direction of particle movement relative to the wave's direction: longitudinal waves oscillate parallel to the wave direction, while transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to it.
