    What are the key equations of motion for uniform motion?
answer: >-
    In the context of physics, uniform motion refers to motion at a constant velocity, meaning that an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time. The key equations of motion for uniform motion are relatively straightforward, as they do not involve acceleration. The primary equation that describes uniform motion is:\n\n1. **Displacement Equation**: \n   $$ \n   d = vt \n   $$\n   where:\n   - $ d $ is the displacement,\n   - $ v $ is the constant velocity,\n   - $ t $ is the time.\n\nIn uniform motion, since the velocity is constant, the relationship between distance, speed, and time is linear. This means that if you know any two of these variables, you can easily calculate the third.\n\nFor example, if an object is moving at a speed of 10 m/s for 5 seconds, the displacement can be calculated as:\n$$\nd = 10 \, \text{m/s} \times 5 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{m}.\n$$\n\nIn summary, the key equation for uniform motion is primarily the displacement equation, which highlights the direct relationship between distance, speed, and time without the need for acceleration terms.
