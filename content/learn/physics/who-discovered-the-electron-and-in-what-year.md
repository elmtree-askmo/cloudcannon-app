    Who discovered the electron and in what year?
answer: >-
    The electron was discovered by the English physicist J.J. Thomson in the year 1897. During his experiments with cathode rays, Thomson demonstrated that these rays were composed of negatively charged particles, which he referred to as "corpuscles," later named electrons. This groundbreaking discovery fundamentally changed the understanding of atomic structure, leading to the realization that atoms are not indivisible solid spheres, but rather consist of smaller subatomic particles. Thomson's work in this area earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906.
