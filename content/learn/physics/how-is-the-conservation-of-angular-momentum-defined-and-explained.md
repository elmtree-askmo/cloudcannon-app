    How is the conservation of angular momentum defined and explained?
answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torque acts on it. This principle is closely related to Newton's laws of motion, particularly the second law, which can be expressed in a rotational context.\n\n### Definition and Mathematical Expression\n\nAngular momentum (\(L\)) is defined mathematically as the product of the moment of inertia (\(I\)) and the angular velocity (\(\omega\)) of an object:\n\n$$\nL = I \omega\n$$\n\nAlternatively, it can also be expressed as the cross product of the position vector (\(r\)) and the linear momentum (\(p\)):\n\n$$\nL = r \times p\n$$\n\n### Explanation of the Principle\n\nIn a closed system where no external torques are acting, the angular momentum remains constant. This can be observed in various physical scenarios, such as an ice skater spinning. When the skater pulls her arms and legs closer to her body, she reduces her moment of inertia. To conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity must increase, resulting in a faster spin. This phenomenon illustrates how angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external torques.\n\n### Implications and Applications\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum is crucial for analyzing the motion of rotating bodies and systems. For example, in celestial mechanics, it helps explain the orbits of planets and the behavior of rotating galaxies. Additionally, it is essential in engineering applications, such as the design of gyroscopes and various mechanical systems.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the conservation of angular momentum is a vital concept in physics that describes how the angular momentum of a closed system remains unchanged in the absence of external torques. This principle not only aids in understanding rotational dynamics but also has significant implications across various fields of science and engineering.
