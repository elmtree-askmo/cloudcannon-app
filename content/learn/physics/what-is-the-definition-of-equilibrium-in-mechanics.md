    What is the definition of equilibrium in mechanics?
answer: >-
    In mechanics, equilibrium is defined as a state in which the sum of all forces and the sum of all moments (or torques) acting on a rigid body are both equal to zero. This results in no net force or acceleration, meaning that the object is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity. \n\nMechanical equilibrium can be understood through the following key points:\n\n1. **Net Force**: The total force acting on the system must be zero. This means that all forces are balanced, preventing any linear acceleration.\n\n2. **Net Torque**: The total torque acting on the system must also be zero. This ensures that there is no angular acceleration, allowing the object to maintain its rotational state.\n\n3. **Types of Equilibrium**: Equilibrium can be categorized into static equilibrium (where the object is at rest) and dynamic equilibrium (where the object is moving at a constant velocity).\n\n4. **Stability**: While an object can be in equilibrium, it may not necessarily be in a stable state. Stability refers to the object's ability to return to equilibrium after being disturbed.\n\nUnderstanding mechanical equilibrium is crucial in various applications, including the design and function of machines, structures, and systems in physics.
