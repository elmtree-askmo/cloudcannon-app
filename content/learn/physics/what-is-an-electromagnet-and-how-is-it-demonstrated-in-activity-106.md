    What is an electromagnet and how is it demonstrated in Activity 10.6?
answer: >-
    An electromagnet is a type of magnet that generates a magnetic field when an electric current is applied to it. Unlike permanent magnets, electromagnets can be turned on and off by controlling the flow of electric current. They consist of a coil of wire, often wrapped around a ferromagnetic core (such as iron), which becomes magnetized when an electric current flows through the coil.\n\nIn Activity 10.6, the objective is to teach students how to build an electromagnet and explore its properties and applications, illustrating the relationship between electricity and magnetism. The activity typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Materials Needed**: Students will require a battery, insulated copper wire, and a ferromagnetic core (like a nail or iron rod).\n2. **Winding the Coil**: Students wrap the insulated copper wire around the ferromagnetic core, ensuring that the wire is tightly coiled.\n3. **Connecting the Circuit**: The ends of the wire are then connected to the battery, allowing electric current to flow through the coil.\n4. **Demonstrating Magnetism**: Once the circuit is complete, the core becomes magnetized, and students can test the strength of the electromagnet by picking up small metal objects.\n\nThis hands-on experiment not only demonstrates the principles of electromagnetism but also allows students to observe how varying the number of coils or the current can affect the strength of the electromagnet. Through this activity, students gain a practical understanding of how electromagnets work and their applications in various devices, such as electric bells and motors.
