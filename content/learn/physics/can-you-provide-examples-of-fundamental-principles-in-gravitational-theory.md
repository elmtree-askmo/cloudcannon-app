    In gravitational theory, several fundamental principles can be identified, particularly those articulated by Sir Isaac Newton and later developments in physics. Here are some key examples:\n\n1. **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**: This law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The formula representing this law is:\n\n   $$\n   F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n   $$\n\n   where $ F $ is the gravitational force, $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2$), $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects, and $ r $ is the distance between their centers.\n\n2. **Gravitational Acceleration**: Newton noted that objects near the Earth's surface experience a constant acceleration due to gravity, denoted as $ g $, which is approximately $ 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 $. This principle explains why all objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum, regardless of their mass.\n\n3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: This principle states that in a closed system, the total angular momentum remains constant if no external torques act on it. This is crucial in understanding the orbits of planets and moons, as they maintain their paths due to the balance of gravitational forces and their angular momentum.\n\n4. **Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion**: Newton's gravitational theory provided a framework for understanding Kepler's laws, which describe the motion of planets around the Sun. For instance, the law of equal areas states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time, which is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n5. **Gravitational Effects on Tides**: The gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides. This principle illustrates how gravitational forces can have significant effects on large-scale natural phenomena.\n\n6. **Equivalence of Gravitational and Inertial Mass**: This principle, which states that gravitational mass (the mass that determines the strength of an object's gravitational attraction) is equivalent to inertial mass (the mass that determines the resistance of an object to acceleration), is foundational in both Newtonian physics and Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n\nThese principles form the basis of our understanding of gravitational interactions and have profound implications in both classical and modern physics.
