answer: >-
    The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. This principle can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\nE_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}},\n$$\n\nwhere $ E $ represents the total energy, which includes various forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, and others. This law is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, allowing for the analysis of energy transformations and the behavior of systems over time.\n\n### Example of Conservation of Energy\n\nA classic example of the law of conservation of energy can be illustrated using a pendulum. When a pendulum swings, it converts potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa. \n\n1. **At the highest point of the swing**: The pendulum has maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic energy. If we denote the potential energy at this point as $ PE_{\text{max}} $ and kinetic energy as $ KE_{\text{min}} = 0 $, we can express the total energy as:\n   $$\n   E_{\text{initial}} = PE_{\text{max}} + KE_{\text{min}} = PE_{\text{max}} + 0 = PE_{\text{max}}.\n   $$\n\n2. **At the lowest point of the swing**: The pendulum has minimum potential energy and maximum kinetic energy. Here, the potential energy is at its lowest point $ PE_{\text{min}} = 0 $ and the kinetic energy is at its maximum $ KE_{\text{max}} $. The total energy at this point can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   E_{\text{final}} = PE_{\text{min}} + KE_{\text{max}} = 0 + KE_{\text{max}} = KE_{\text{max}}.\n   $$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy at the highest point must equal the total energy at the lowest point:\n\n$$\nPE_{\text{max}} = KE_{\text{max}}.\n$$\n\nThroughout the pendulum's motion, energy is transformed from potential to kinetic and back again, but the total energy remains constant, demonstrating the law of conservation of energy in action.
