    How can a position vs. time graph be used to determine velocity?
answer: >-
    A position vs. time graph is a fundamental tool in kinematics that allows us to determine the velocity of an object. Hereâ€™s how it works:\n\n1. **Understanding the Graph**: In a position vs. time graph, the position of an object is plotted on the y-axis, while time is plotted on the x-axis. The shape of the graph provides insights into the motion of the object.\n\n2. **Slope Represents Velocity**: The key to determining velocity from this graph lies in the concept of slope. The slope of the position vs. time graph is defined as the change in position (rise) divided by the change in time (run). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\n   $$\n   where $\Delta x$ is the change in position and $\Delta t$ is the change in time. \n\n3. **Interpreting the Slope**: \n   - A **steeper slope** indicates a higher velocity, meaning the object is moving faster.\n   - A **gentle slope** indicates a lower velocity, meaning the object is moving slower.\n   - A **horizontal line** (slope = 0) indicates that the object is stationary.\n\n4. **Average vs. Instantaneous Velocity**: \n   - The **average velocity** over a time interval can be calculated using the slope between two points on the graph. \n   - The **instantaneous velocity** at a specific point in time is represented by the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. If the graph is a straight line, the instantaneous velocity is constant and equal to the slope of that line. If the graph is curved, the slope will change, indicating that the velocity is also changing.\n\n5. **Example**: If a position vs. time graph shows a curve that becomes steeper over time, this indicates that the object's velocity is increasing. Conversely, if the curve flattens, the object's velocity is decreasing.\n\nIn summary, by analyzing the slope of a position vs. time graph, one can effectively determine both the average and instantaneous velocities of an object, providing valuable insights into its motion.
