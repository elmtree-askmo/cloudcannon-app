    Can you explain Newton's Law of Gravitation and its mathematical formulation?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687, is a fundamental principle in classical physics that describes the gravitational attraction between two masses. The law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. \n\nThe mathematical formulation of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation illustrates that as the masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ increase, the gravitational force $ F $ also increases. Conversely, as the distance $ r $ between the masses increases, the gravitational force decreases, following an inverse square relationship.\n\nNewton's insight into gravitation was revolutionary, as he connected the motion of celestial bodies, such as the Moon and planets, with the same principles that govern objects on Earth. He noted that the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is approximately $ g \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, and he used this to explain the motion of the Moon, which experiences a centripetal acceleration that is significantly less than that of objects on Earth.\n\nIn summary, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation not only provides a mathematical framework for understanding gravitational interactions but also laid the groundwork for classical mechanics, influencing our understanding of both terrestrial and celestial phenomena.
