answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. It describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics.\n\n### Statement of the Law\nThe Law of Universal Gravitation states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two objects,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\n### Explanation of the Formula\n1. **Direct Proportionality**: The force $ F $ increases as either mass $ m_1 $ or $ m_2 $ increases. This means that larger masses exert a stronger gravitational pull on each other.\n2. **Inverse Square Law**: The force $ F $ decreases with the square of the distance $ r $ between the two masses. This means that if the distance between the masses doubles, the gravitational force becomes one-fourth as strong.\n\n### Vector Form\nIn vector form, the gravitational force can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\vec{F} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}\n$$\n\nHere, $ \hat{r} $ is the unit vector pointing from one mass to the other, and the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive.\n\n### Practical Applications\nNewton's Law of Gravitation is essential for understanding various phenomena, including:\n- The motion of planets in their orbits,\n- The behavior of satellites around Earth,\n- The forces acting on objects on the surface of the Earth.\n\n### Limitations\nWhile Newton's Law of Gravitation is highly accurate for many practical purposes, it does have limitations. It does not account for relativistic effects, which become significant at very high speeds or in strong gravitational fields, as described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\nIn summary, Newton's Law of Gravitation provides a comprehensive framework for understanding gravitational interactions between masses, and its mathematical formulation is a cornerstone of classical physics.
