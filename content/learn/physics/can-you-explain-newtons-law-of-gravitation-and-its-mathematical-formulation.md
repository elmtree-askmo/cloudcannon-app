answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is a fundamental principle in classical physics that describes the gravitational attraction between two masses. Formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century, this law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of Newton's Law of Gravitation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation encapsulates the essence of gravitational interaction: as the masses $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ increase, the gravitational force $ F $ also increases. Conversely, as the distance $ r $ between the masses increases, the gravitational force decreases, following an inverse square relationship.\n\nNewton's insights into gravitation not only explained the motion of celestial bodies but also provided a framework for understanding various phenomena on Earth, such as the falling of objects and the orbits of planets. His work laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and has had profound implications in both physics and mathematics, illustrating the deep interconnection between these two fields.
