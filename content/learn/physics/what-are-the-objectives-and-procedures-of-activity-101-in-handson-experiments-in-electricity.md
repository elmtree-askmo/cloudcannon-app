answer: >-
    Activity 10.1 in hands-on experiments in electricity focuses on constructing a basic electric circuit to illuminate a bulb. The objectives and procedures for this activity are as follows:\n\n### Objective\nThe primary goal of Activity 10.1 is to help students learn how to construct a basic electric circuit. This includes understanding the essential components of a circuit, which are:\n- **Source of electricity** (battery)\n- **Conductors** (wires)\n- **Load** (bulb)\n\nBy connecting these components correctly, students will create a path (circuit) for electric current, allowing the bulb to illuminate.\n\n### Procedure\n1. **Gather Materials**: Collect the necessary components, including a battery, connecting wires, and a bulb.\n2. **Set Up the Circuit**:\n   - Connect one terminal of the battery to one terminal of the bulb using a wire.\n   - Connect the other terminal of the bulb to the other terminal of the battery with another wire.\n3. **Complete the Circuit**: Ensure that all connections are secure and that there are no breaks in the circuit.\n4. **Observe the Result**: Once the circuit is complete, the electric current should flow from the battery through the wires to the bulb, causing it to illuminate.\n5. **Experiment with Variations**: Students can modify the circuit by adding more bulbs or using different types of batteries to observe how these changes affect the circuit's performance.\n\nThis hands-on activity not only reinforces theoretical knowledge about electric circuits but also provides practical experience in circuit construction and troubleshooting.
