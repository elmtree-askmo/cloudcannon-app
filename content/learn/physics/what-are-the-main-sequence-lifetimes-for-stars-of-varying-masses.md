    What are the main sequence lifetimes for stars of varying masses?
answer: >-
    The lifetimes of main sequence stars vary significantly based on their mass due to differences in their luminosity and the rate at which they consume their nuclear fuel. Here are some key points regarding the main sequence lifetimes for stars of varying masses:\n\n1. **High-Mass Stars (O-type and B-type)**: \n   - A star with a mass around 40 solar masses (O-type) has a very short main sequence lifetime of approximately 1 million years. \n   - A 10 solar mass star (B-type) typically lasts about 20 million years on the main sequence.\n\n2. **Intermediate-Mass Stars (A-type and F-type)**:\n   - A star with a mass of about 5 solar masses (A-type) will have a main sequence lifetime of around 100 million years.\n   - A 2 solar mass star (F-type) can spend about 1.5 billion years on the main sequence.\n\n3. **Solar-Mass Stars (G-type)**:\n   - Our Sun, which is a G-type star, has a main sequence lifetime of approximately 10 billion years.\n\n4. **Low-Mass Stars (K-type and M-type)**:\n   - A star with a mass of 0.5 solar masses (K-type) can live for about 80 billion years on the main sequence.\n   - M-type stars, which are even less massive (around 0.2 solar masses), can have lifetimes extending up to 560 billion years. Given that the Universe is only about 13.7 billion years old, all M-type stars that have ever formed are still on the main sequence.\n\n5. **General Trend**: \n   - The relationship between mass and main sequence lifetime can be approximated by the formula:\n   $$\n   \text{Lifetime} \propto \frac{M}{L}\n   $$\n   where $L$ (luminosity) is related to mass by the power law $L \propto M^{3.5}$. This means that more massive stars, while having more fuel, burn through it at a much faster rate, resulting in shorter lifetimes compared to their less massive counterparts.\n\nIn summary, the main sequence lifetimes of stars range from about 1 million years for the most massive stars to several hundred billion years for the least massive stars, illustrating a vast disparity in stellar evolution based on mass.
