    What are peculiar galaxies and what causes their unusual features?
answer: >-
    A peculiar galaxy is a type of galaxy that exhibits unusual or distorted shapes, deviating from the standard classifications of galaxies such as spiral or elliptical. These galaxies account for approximately five to ten percent of known galaxies and are characterized by their irregular structures, tidal tails, and disrupted stellar distributions.\n\nPeculiar galaxies can be categorized into two main types: interacting galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Interacting galaxies are those that are in close proximity to one another, where their mutual gravitational forces can lead to significant distortions in their shapes. This interaction often results in the merging of galaxies, which can create complex structures and features. For instance, when two galaxies collide, they may pull each other out of shape, leading to the formation of irregular galaxies.\n\nActive galactic nuclei, on the other hand, are peculiar galaxies that contain supermassive black holes at their centers, which can emit large amounts of energy. These galaxies often display high levels of activity and can be identified by their bright emissions, which are indicative of the presence of these black holes.\n\nExamples of peculiar galaxies include Fornax A, Arp 209, and Arp 148, as well as ESO 162-17, which is located 40 million light-years away in the constellation Carina. The unusual features of peculiar galaxies provide valuable insights into the processes of galaxy formation and evolution, as they often represent the dynamic interactions that occur in the universe.
