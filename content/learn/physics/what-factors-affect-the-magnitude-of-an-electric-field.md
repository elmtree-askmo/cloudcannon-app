    What factors affect the magnitude of an electric field?
answer: >-
    The magnitude of an electric field is primarily influenced by two key factors:\n\n1. **Charge of the Source**: The strength of the electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge creating the field. According to Coulomb's law, the electric field $E$ created by a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ is given by the formula:\n\n   $$\n   E = k \frac{|Q|}{r^2}\n   $$\n\n   where $k$ is Coulomb's constant (approximately $8.9876 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2$). This indicates that a larger charge will produce a stronger electric field.\n\n2. **Distance from the Charge**: The electric field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge. As the distance $r$ increases, the electric field strength decreases rapidly. This relationship is crucial in understanding how electric fields behave in space.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of an electric field is determined by the amount of charge creating the field and the distance from that charge. The closer you are to the charge, the stronger the electric field, and the greater the charge, the stronger the electric field as well.
