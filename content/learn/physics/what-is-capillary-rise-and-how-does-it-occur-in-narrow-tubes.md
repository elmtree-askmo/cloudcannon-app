    What is capillary rise, and how does it occur in narrow tubes?
answer: >-
    Capillary rise is the phenomenon where a liquid ascends in a narrow tube, known as a capillary tube, due to the combined effects of surface tension, adhesion, and cohesion. This process occurs without the assistance of external forces and is particularly noticeable in tubes with very small diameters.\n\nWhen a capillary tube is immersed in a liquid, the liquid either rises or falls relative to the surrounding liquid level. The rise occurs because the adhesive forces between the liquid molecules and the tube's surface are stronger than the cohesive forces among the liquid molecules themselves. This results in the liquid climbing up the walls of the tube, counteracting the force of gravity.\n\nThe height to which the liquid rises can be influenced by several factors, including the diameter of the tube, the surface tension of the liquid, and the density of the liquid. For example, water, which has a higher surface tension compared to ethanol, will rise higher in the same capillary tube due to its stronger adhesive forces with the tube material.\n\nCapillary rise is essential in various biological and physical processes, such as the absorption of water by plant roots and the movement of ink in pens. It illustrates the interplay between intermolecular forces and is a vivid example of capillarity, also referred to as capillary action or capillary motion.
