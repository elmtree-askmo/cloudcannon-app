    What are the effects of a non-zero net force on an object?
answer: >-
    The effects of a non-zero net force on an object are significant and can be understood through Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration, expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nF_{net} = ma\n$$\n\nThis relationship implies that when a non-zero net force is applied to an object, it will cause the object to accelerate in the direction of the net force. The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the object's mass. Therefore, a larger net force results in a greater acceleration, while a more massive object requires a larger force to achieve the same acceleration as a less massive object.\n\nFor example, if a 2 kg object experiences a net force of 10 N, the acceleration can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\na = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \frac{10 \, \text{N}}{2 \, \text{kg}} = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2\n$$\n\nThis means the object will accelerate at a rate of 5 m/sÂ² in the direction of the net force.\n\nAdditionally, if the net force is not zero, the object's velocity will change, which can include speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Conversely, if the net force is zero, the object will either remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity, as per Newton's first law of motion (the law of inertia).\n\nIn summary, a non-zero net force results in a change in the motion of an object, leading to acceleration in the direction of the force, with the amount of acceleration depending on both the magnitude of the net force and the mass of the object.
