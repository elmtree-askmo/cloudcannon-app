answer: >-
    Here are some examples of problem-solving with electric fields, illustrating various scenarios and calculations:\n\n1. **Finding the Magnitude of a Point Charge**:\n   - **Problem**: What is the magnitude of a point charge whose electric field at a distance of 25 cm is 3.4 N/C?\n   - **Solution**: The electric field $ E $ due to a point charge $ q $ at a distance $ r $ is given by the formula:\n     $$\n     E = k \frac{q}{r^2}\n     $$\n     Rearranging for $ q $:\n     $$\n     q = \frac{E \cdot r^2}{k}\n     $$\n     Substituting $ E = 3.4 \, \text{N/C} $, $ r = 0.25 \, \text{m} $, and $ k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $:\n     $$\n     q = \frac{3.4 \cdot (0.25)^2}{9 \times 10^9} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C}\n     $$\n\n2. **Electric Field of a Dipole**:\n   - **Problem**: A dipole is set up with a charge magnitude of $ 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C} $ for each charge (one positive and one negative). The distance between the charges is 0.15 m. What is the electric field at a point along the axis of the dipole?\n   - **Solution**: The electric field $ E $ at a distance $ r $ from the center of a dipole along its axis is given by:\n     $$\n     E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3}\n     $$\n     where $ p = q \cdot d $ is the dipole moment. Here, $ d = 0.15 \, \text{m} $ and $ q = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C} $:\n     $$\n     p = (2 \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 0.15 = 3 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C m}\n     $$\n     For a point far from the dipole, if $ r $ is significantly larger than $ d $, we can substitute $ r $ with a suitable value to find $ E $.\n\n3. **Electric Field from a Uniformly Charged Rod**:\n   - **Problem**: A rod of length $ L $ carries a total charge $ Q $ uniformly distributed. Find the electric field at a point along the perpendicular bisector of the rod.\n   - **Solution**: The electric field $ E $ at a distance $ y $ from the center of the rod can be calculated using integration:\n     $$\n     E = \int \frac{k \, dq}{(y^2 + (x^2))} \cos(\theta)\n     $$\n     where $ dq = \frac{Q}{L} dx $ and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2 + x^2}} \). The limits of integration will be from $ -\frac{L}{2} $ to $ \frac{L}{2} $.\n\n4. **Electric Field of a Ring of Charge**:\n   - **Problem**: Calculate the electric field at the center of a ring of radius $ R $ with a uniform charge $ Q $.\n   - **Solution**: The electric field at the center of the ring is zero due to symmetry, as the contributions from all charge elements cancel out.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to apply the principles of electric fields to solve various problems involving point charges, dipoles, and continuous charge distributions. Each problem requires an understanding of the underlying physics and the ability to manipulate the relevant equations.
