    What is the specific condition under which Newton's First Law applies?
answer: >-
    Newton's First Law of Motion, often referred to as the law of inertia, states that "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force." This law highlights the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion.\n\nThe specific condition under which Newton's First Law applies is when the net external force acting on an object is zero. This means that either no forces are acting on the object, or all the forces acting on it are balanced, resulting in a state of equilibrium. In such cases, an object will maintain its current state—whether at rest or in uniform motion—until an unbalanced force is applied.\n\nFor example, if a car is parked, all forces acting on it (such as gravity, friction, and the normal force from the ground) are balanced, and thus the car remains at rest. Conversely, if the car is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, the forces acting on it are also balanced, allowing it to continue moving in that manner. If an external force, such as braking or acceleration, is applied, the state of motion will change, demonstrating the principle of inertia.\n\nIn summary, Newton's First Law applies under the condition of zero net external force, allowing objects to maintain their state of motion or rest.
