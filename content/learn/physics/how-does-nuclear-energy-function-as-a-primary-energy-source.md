    How does nuclear energy function as a primary energy source?
answer: >-
    Nuclear energy functions as a primary energy source by harnessing the energy released during nuclear fission, a process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts, releasing a significant amount of heat. This heat is used to boil water, creating steam that turns a turbine connected to a generator, which then produces electricity. Approximately 20% of the electricity generated in the United States comes from nuclear energy, highlighting its role in the energy mix.\n\nThe energy contained in the nucleus of an atom is immense, primarily due to the strong force that holds the nucleus together. In nuclear power plants, the most commonly used fuel is uranium-235, which can sustain a fission chain reaction. When a uranium-235 nucleus absorbs a neutron, it becomes unstable and splits, releasing additional neutrons that can induce fission in nearby nuclei, thus perpetuating the reaction and generating large amounts of heat.\n\nNuclear energy is characterized by its high capacity factor, meaning that nuclear power plants can produce electricity at maximum output more consistently than other energy sources, operating at about 93% of their capacity. This reliability makes nuclear energy an ideal source of baseload power, providing a stable supply of electricity to the grid.\n\nMoreover, nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source, producing no air pollution during operation, which positions it as a crucial player in efforts to combat climate change. However, it is important to note that nuclear energy is not renewable, as it relies on finite uranium resources, and it presents challenges such as the management of radioactive waste and the high upfront costs associated with building nuclear power plants.\n\nIn summary, nuclear energy serves as a primary energy source by converting the energy released from nuclear fission into electricity, contributing significantly to the global energy supply while also facing various environmental and social challenges.
