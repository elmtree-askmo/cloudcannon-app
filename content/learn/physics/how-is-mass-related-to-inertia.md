    How is mass related to inertia?
answer: >-
    Mass and inertia are closely related concepts in physics, particularly in the context of Newton's First Law of Motion, which is often referred to as the law of inertia. \n\n1. **Definition of Inertia**: Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. This means that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.\n\n2. **Role of Mass**: Mass quantifies inertia. Specifically, the greater the mass of an object, the greater its inertia. This means that a heavier object will resist changes to its motion more than a lighter object. For example, a stone (which has a larger mass) will have more inertia than a rubber ball (which has a smaller mass). Thus, we can say that "the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia."\n\n3. **Proportional Relationship**: The relationship between mass and inertia can be summarized as follows: the larger the mass, the larger the inertia, and conversely, the smaller the mass, the smaller the inertia. This proportionality indicates that mass directly affects how much an object resists changes in its motion.\n\n4. **Practical Implications**: In practical terms, this means that a massive object, such as a train, will require a greater force to change its state of motion compared to a less massive object, like a bicycle. This principle is often demonstrated in physics experiments, where the resistance to motion is clearly observed with varying masses.\n\n5. **Galileo's Contribution**: The foundational ideas about inertia were first explored by Galileo, who posited that objects tend to maintain their state of motion unless acted upon by an external force. Newton later formalized these ideas into his laws of motion, emphasizing the role of mass in determining inertia.\n\nIn summary, mass is a quantitative measure of inertia, and understanding this relationship is crucial for analyzing forces and motion in both classical and modern physics.
