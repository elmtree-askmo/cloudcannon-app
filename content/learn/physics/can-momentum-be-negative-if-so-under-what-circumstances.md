    Can momentum be negative? If so, under what circumstances?
answer: >-
    Yes, momentum can indeed be negative. Momentum is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. The formula for momentum is given by:\n\n$$\np = mv\n$$\n\nwhere $ p $ is momentum, $ m $ is mass, and $ v $ is velocity. \n\nIf an object is moving in the opposite direction of the chosen reference frame, its velocity will be negative, resulting in negative momentum. For example, if we define forward motion as positive, then an object moving backward will have a negative velocity, and consequently, its momentum will also be negative. \n\nIn summary, momentum can be negative when an object is moving in the opposite direction to the defined positive direction in a given reference frame. This characteristic of momentum being a vector allows it to take on both positive and negative values based on the direction of motion.
