    What is the function of Geiger-Muller tubes in radiation measurement?
answer: >-
    The Geiger-Muller tube, commonly referred to as a Geiger counter, is a crucial instrument for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. It operates based on the principle of ionization, where radiation interacts with the gas inside the tube, typically argon or neon, causing ionization events.\n\nWhen ionizing radiation passes through the Geiger-Muller tube, it ionizes the gas, creating positive ions and free electrons. This ionization leads to a cascade effect, where the freed electrons accelerate towards a positively charged electrode, resulting in an avalanche of charge that produces a measurable pulse of current. The tube is sealed and operates under low pressure, which enhances its sensitivity to radiation.\n\nThe Geiger counter is widely used in various applications, including radiation dosimetry, radiological protection, and experimental physics. It provides a straightforward and effective method for radiation detection, making it an invaluable tool in both medical and environmental settings. The device was developed by Hans Geiger and Walther MÃ¼ller in 1928, and it has since become a standard instrument for radiation measurement.
