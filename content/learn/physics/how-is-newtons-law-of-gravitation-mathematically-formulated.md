    How is Newton's Law of Gravitation mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, is mathematically formulated as follows:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- \( F \) is the magnitude of the gravitational force between two point masses,\n- \( G \) is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),\n- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects,\n- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship highlights the fundamental nature of gravitational interactions in classical physics.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, if we have two masses, say \( m_1 = 30 \, \text{kg} \) and \( m_2 = 50 \, \text{kg} \), separated by a distance of \( r = 4 \, \text{m} \), we can calculate the gravitational force \( F \) as follows:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{(30)(50)}{(4)^2}\n$$\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n$$\nF = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{1500}{16} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times 93.75 \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N}\n$$\n\nThis example demonstrates how the law quantitatively describes the gravitational force between two masses based on their values and the distance separating them.\n\nNewton's formulation of gravitation not only provided a mathematical framework for understanding gravitational forces but also laid the groundwork for further developments in physics, including celestial mechanics and the understanding of orbits.
