    How is resultant intensity determined in interference patterns?
answer: >-
    In interference patterns, the resultant intensity at a point is determined by the superposition of the electric fields of the interfering waves. The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the electric field. Therefore, the resultant intensity $I$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nI = |E_1 + E_2|^2\n$$\n\nwhere $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the electric fields of the two waves. This can be expanded to:\n\n$$\nI = E_1^2 + E_2^2 + 2E_1E_2\cos(\phi)\n$$\n\nHere, $\phi$ is the phase difference between the two waves. For two waves of equal intensity $I_1$ and $I_2$, the resultant intensity can be simplified to:\n\n$$\nI = 4I_1\cos^2\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\n$$\n\nIn the case of unequal intensities, the maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated as:\n\n- Maximum intensity: \n$$\nI_{\text{max}} = |A_1 + A_2|^2\n$$\n- Minimum intensity:\n$$\nI_{\text{min}} = |A_1 - A_2|^2\n$$\n\nThe conditions for constructive and destructive interference are determined by the path difference between the waves. Constructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integral multiple of the wavelength ($\Delta L = n\lambda$), leading to a phase difference of $2\pi n$. Conversely, destructive interference occurs when the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength (\(\Delta L = (n + 1/2)\lambda\)), resulting in a phase difference of \((2n + 1)\pi\).\n\nIn practical applications, such as in double-slit experiments, the interference pattern observed on a screen is a result of these principles, where bright fringes correspond to constructive interference and dark fringes correspond to destructive interference. The intensity at any point on the screen can be calculated using the aforementioned formulas, taking into account the phase difference and the amplitudes of the waves involved.
