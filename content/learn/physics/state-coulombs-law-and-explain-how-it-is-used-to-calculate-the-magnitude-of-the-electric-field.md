    State Coulomb's Law and explain how it is used to calculate the magnitude of the electric field.
answer: >-
    Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic interaction between charged particles. It states that the magnitude of the electric force $ F $ between two point charges $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ F $ is the magnitude of the electric force between the charges,\n- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $,\n- $ |q_1| $ and $ |q_2| $ are the magnitudes of the charges,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two charges.\n\n### Calculating the Magnitude of the Electric Field\n\nCoulomb's Law can also be used to calculate the electric field $ E $ created by a point charge $ Q $ at a distance $ r $ from the charge. The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge experienced by a small positive test charge placed in the field. The formula for the electric field due to a point charge is:\n\n$$\nE = \frac{kQ}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ E $ is the electric field strength,\n- $ Q $ is the charge creating the electric field,\n- $ r $ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being measured.\n\n### Explanation of the Electric Field\n\nThe electric field $ E $ is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the electric field is defined as the direction that a positive test charge would move if placed in the field. Therefore:\n- If the charge $ Q $ is positive, the electric field points away from the charge.\n- If the charge $ Q $ is negative, the electric field points towards the charge.\n\nIn summary, Coulomb's Law provides a fundamental understanding of the forces between charged objects and is essential for calculating the electric field generated by point charges.
