    What are the base units in the International System of Units (SI)?
answer: >-
    The International System of Units (SI) is a globally accepted system of measurement that is based on seven base units, each corresponding to a fundamental physical quantity. These base units are essential as they serve as the foundation from which all other SI units are derived. Here are the seven SI base units along with their symbols and the physical quantities they represent:\n\n1. **Second (s)** - The SI unit of time.\n2. **Metre (m)** - The SI unit of length.\n3. **Kilogram (kg)** - The SI unit of mass.\n4. **Ampere (A)** - The SI unit of electric current.\n5. **Kelvin (K)** - The SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.\n6. **Mole (mol)** - The SI unit of the amount of substance.\n7. **Candela (cd)** - The SI unit of luminous intensity.\n\nEach of these units has been defined based on fundamental physical constants. For example, the second is defined by the frequency of radiation associated with a specific transition of the cesium-133 atom, while the metre is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in a specific fraction of a second.\n\nThe SI system is crucial for ensuring consistency and standardization in scientific measurements across different fields and disciplines, facilitating communication and collaboration among scientists and researchers worldwide.
