answer: >-
    In the context of physics, "interaction" refers to the mutual influence that two or more objects exert on each other through forces. This concept is fundamental to understanding how forces operate according to Newton's laws of motion, particularly Newton's Third Law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n\nWhen one object exerts a force on another, the second object simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction back on the first object. This reciprocal nature of forces means that interactions cannot occur in isolation; they always involve pairs of forces acting on different objects. For example, when a person pushes against a wall, the wall pushes back with an equal force in the opposite direction.\n\nInteractions can be categorized into various types, such as gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear interactions, each characterized by the forces involved and the nature of the objects interacting. Understanding these interactions is crucial for analyzing motion, acceleration, and the dynamics of systems in both classical and modern physics.
