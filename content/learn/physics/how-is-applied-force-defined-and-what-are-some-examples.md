    How is applied force defined and what are some examples?
answer: >-
    Applied force is defined as the force exerted on an object by another object or a person through direct contact. It is a type of contact force that can cause an object to move, change its motion, or deform. The effects of applied force can be observed in terms of acceleration or movement in the direction of the force.\n\n### Examples of Applied Force\n\n1. **Pushing a Door**: When you push a door to open it, you are applying a force that causes the door to move in the direction of the push.\n\n2. **Catching a Ball**: When a football player catches a ball, the player exerts an applied force on the ball to stop its motion.\n\n3. **Squeezing a Bottle**: When you squeeze a plastic bottle, the force you apply changes the shape of the bottle and can cause the liquid inside to be expelled.\n\n4. **Shooting an Arrow**: When you pull back on a bowstring and release it, the force applied to the arrow propels it forward.\n\n5. **Lifting an Object**: When you lift a box off the ground, the force you exert counteracts the gravitational force acting on the box, allowing it to move upward.\n\n### Calculation of Applied Force\n\nThe applied force can be calculated using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\n$$\nF = m \cdot a\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the applied force,\n- $ m $ is the mass of the object,\n- $ a $ is the acceleration.\n\nIn summary, applied force plays a crucial role in the motion and interaction of objects in our everyday lives, and understanding its definition and examples helps in grasping fundamental concepts in physics.
