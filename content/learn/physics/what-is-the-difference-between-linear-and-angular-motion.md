    What is the difference between linear and angular motion?
answer: >-
    The difference between linear and angular motion primarily lies in the type of movement and the parameters used to describe that movement.\n\n### Linear Motion\nLinear motion refers to movement along a straight path. It can be characterized by parameters such as:\n- **Position**: The location of an object in space.\n- **Velocity**: The rate of change of position, typically measured in meters per second (m/s).\n- **Acceleration**: The rate of change of velocity, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).\n\nIn linear motion, the forces acting on the object can be analyzed using Newton's laws of motion. For example, when throwing a basketball, the ball follows a parabolic trajectory, which can be described using linear equations of motion.\n\n### Angular Motion\nAngular motion, on the other hand, involves rotation around an axis. It is characterized by:\n- **Angular Displacement**: The angle through which an object has rotated about a specific axis, measured in radians.\n- **Angular Velocity**: The rate of change of angular displacement, typically measured in radians per second (rad/s).\n- **Angular Acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity, measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²).\n\nAngular motion can be analyzed using similar principles as linear motion, but the equations and parameters are adapted for rotation. For instance, when a basketball spins, it exhibits angular motion, and its behavior can be described using angular kinematics.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, linear motion deals with straight-line movement and is described using linear parameters, while angular motion involves rotation around an axis and is described using angular parameters. Both types of motion are essential for understanding biomechanics and the mechanics of human movement, as they provide insights into how forces and torques affect the body during various activities.
