    What is angular frequency and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Angular frequency, denoted by the Greek letter Ï‰ (omega), is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the study of oscillations and wave motion. It measures the rate of angular displacement of a particle per unit time and is expressed in radians per second (rad/s). Angular frequency is particularly useful in describing the oscillatory motion of mechanical systems, such as in mechanical vibrations.\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency and the time period (T) of a periodic motion is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ \omega $ is the angular frequency,\n- $ T $ is the time period, which is the time taken for one complete cycle of oscillation.\n\nAdditionally, angular frequency can also be calculated from the frequency (f) of the oscillation, which is measured in hertz (Hz), using the formula:\n\n$$\n\omega = 2\pi f\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ f $ is the frequency in oscillations per second.\n\nIn summary, angular frequency provides a way to quantify the speed of oscillatory motion in terms of angular displacement, making it a crucial parameter in various applications, including mechanical vibrations and electrical circuits.
