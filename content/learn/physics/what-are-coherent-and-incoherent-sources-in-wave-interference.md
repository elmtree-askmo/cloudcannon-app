    What are coherent and incoherent sources in wave interference?
answer: >-
    In wave interference, coherent and incoherent sources are defined based on their phase relationships and the characteristics of the waves they emit.\n\n**Coherent Sources**:\n- Coherent sources are those that emit waves with a constant phase difference, meaning they have the same frequency, wavelength, and phase. This consistency allows for sustained interference patterns, where the positions of maxima (constructive interference) and minima (destructive interference) remain fixed. \n- Examples of coherent sources include laser light and sound waves from speakers driven by electrical signals that maintain the same frequency and phase. These sources are crucial in applications such as wave optics, where precise interference effects are required.\n\n**Incoherent Sources**:\n- In contrast, incoherent sources emit waves that have different frequencies, wavelengths, and phases, leading to random phase relationships. This randomness results in unpredictable interference patterns, making it difficult to observe sustained interference effects.\n- Common examples of incoherent sources include conventional light sources like incandescent bulbs and natural light. The transitions between energy levels in atoms that produce light in these sources are random processes, contributing to their incoherent nature.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between coherent and incoherent sources lies in the consistency of their phase relationships: coherent sources maintain a constant phase difference, while incoherent sources exhibit random phase variations. This distinction is essential for understanding wave interference phenomena in various physical applications.
