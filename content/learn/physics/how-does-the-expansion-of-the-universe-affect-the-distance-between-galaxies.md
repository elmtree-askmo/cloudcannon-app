    How does the expansion of the universe affect the distance between galaxies?
answer: >-
    The expansion of the universe significantly affects the distance between galaxies, primarily through the mechanism described by Hubble's Law. According to this law, every galaxy is receding from us at a speed that is directly proportional to its distance. This means that a galaxy that is twice as far away from us is moving away at twice the speed of a closer galaxy. As the universe expands, the scale factor of the universe increases, which stretches the fabric of space itself, causing galaxies to move farther apart over time.\n\nLocally, the internal forces within galaxies, such as gravity, are strong enough to keep them intact and maintain their sizes and distances from one another. However, on larger scales, the expansion of space dominates, leading to an increase in the distances between galaxies. For instance, if we observe a galaxy that is ten billion light years away, we are seeing it as it appeared ten billion years ago, and the light from that galaxy is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe redshift, denoted as $z$, is a crucial concept in understanding this expansion. It relates the observed wavelength of light from distant galaxies to the emitted wavelength and the change in the scale factor of the universe over time. For example, a galaxy with a redshift of $z=1$ indicates that the universe has expanded by a factor of 2 since the light left that galaxy.\n\nIn summary, while the expansion of the universe does not affect the apparent size of individual galaxies, it does lead to an increase in the distances between them, as evidenced by the redshift of light from distant galaxies and the observations supporting Hubble's Law. This expansion is a fundamental aspect of our understanding of the cosmos and the large-scale structure of the universe.
