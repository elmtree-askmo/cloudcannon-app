    How does the internal resistance of a battery affect terminal voltage?
answer: >-
    The internal resistance of a battery plays a significant role in determining its terminal voltage, which is the voltage available at the battery's terminals when a load is connected. The relationship between terminal voltage $V$, electromotive force (emf) $e$, current $I$, and internal resistance $r$ can be expressed by the formula:\n\n$$\nV = e - Ir\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $I$ is the current flowing away from the positive terminal of the battery, and $r$ is the internal resistance of the battery. When a current flows, the internal resistance causes a voltage drop across the battery itself, which reduces the terminal voltage available to the load.\n\nAs the internal resistance $r$ increases, the voltage drop $Ir$ becomes more significant, leading to a lower terminal voltage $V$. This means that for a given load, a battery with higher internal resistance will deliver less voltage than one with lower internal resistance. Consequently, a battery with high internal resistance may struggle to provide sufficient power to the load, affecting its performance and efficiency.\n\nMoreover, the internal resistance can also impact the battery's overall performance, including its capacity, power delivery, and lifespan. Higher internal resistance can lead to increased heat generation during operation, which can further degrade the battery's performance over time.\n\nIn summary, the internal resistance of a battery is a critical factor that affects its terminal voltage and overall efficiency, making it essential to consider when evaluating battery performance in various applications.
