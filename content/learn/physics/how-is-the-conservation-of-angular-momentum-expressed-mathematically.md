    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental physics principle stating that the total angular momentum of an isolated system remains constant unless acted upon by a net external torque. This concept is mathematically expressed through various equations relating angular momentum, torque, and motion.

answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of an isolated system remains constant unless acted upon by a net external torque. Mathematically, this can be expressed in several ways.\n\n1. **General Expression**: The angular momentum $ L $ of a rotating object can be defined as:\n   $$\n   L = I \omega\n   $$\n   where $ I $ is the moment of inertia and $ \omega $ is the angular velocity.\n\n2. **Rate of Change**: The principle can also be expressed in terms of torque $ \tau $:\n   $$\n   \frac{dL}{dt} = \tau\n   $$\n   This indicates that the rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the torque applied to the system. Therefore, if the net torque is zero, the angular momentum is conserved:\n   $$\n   \frac{dL}{dt} = 0 \implies L = \text{constant}\n   $$\n\n3. **For a System of Particles**: For a system of particles, the total angular momentum $ \vec{L} $ around a point in a fixed inertial reference frame can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \vec{L} = \vec{l_1} + \vec{l_2} + \ldots + \vec{l_N} = \text{constant}\n   $$\n   where $ \vec{l_i} $ represents the angular momentum of each particle.\n\n4. **In Circular Motion**: For an object moving in a circular path, the angular momentum can be calculated using:\n   $$\n   L = m \times v \times r\n   $$\n   where $ m $ is the mass, $ v $ is the tangential velocity, and $ r $ is the radius of the circular path.\n\nThese mathematical formulations illustrate how angular momentum is conserved in various scenarios, such as in the case of an ice skater spinning, where the net torque is negligible, allowing the skater to conserve angular momentum by adjusting her body position. This principle is crucial in understanding rotational dynamics and is applicable across various fields of physics, including classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.
