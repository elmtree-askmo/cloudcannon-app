    How is the conservation of angular momentum expressed mathematically?
answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torques are applied. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{\tau}_{\text{net}} = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $\mathbf{L}$ is the angular momentum vector and $\mathbf{\tau}_{\text{net}}$ is the net external torque acting on the system. If the net torque is zero, the angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ is conserved:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{L}_{\text{final}} = \mathbf{L}_{\text{initial}}\n$$\n\nAngular momentum itself is defined as the product of the moment of inertia $I$ and the angular velocity $\omega$ of a rotating object:\n\n$$\n\mathbf{L} = I \omega\n$$\n\nIn a closed system, if one part of the system changes its moment of inertia (for example, an ice skater pulling in their arms), the angular velocity must change in such a way that the product $I \omega$ remains constant. This is often illustrated with examples such as ice skaters or divers, who manipulate their body position to control their rotation speed while conserving angular momentum.\n\nIn summary, the conservation of angular momentum can be mathematically expressed through the relationships between torque, angular momentum, and the moment of inertia, highlighting the principle that in the absence of external influences, the total angular momentum of a system remains unchanged.
