    What are the sign conventions for work in the first law of thermodynamics?
answer: >-
    In the context of the first law of thermodynamics, the sign conventions for work and heat are crucial for correctly analyzing energy transfers in thermodynamic systems. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The sign conventions are as follows:\n\n1. **Work (W)**:\n   - **Work done by the system**: Positive. This occurs during processes such as expansion, where the system does work on the surroundings.\n   - **Work done on the system**: Negative. This occurs during processes such as compression, where the surroundings do work on the system.\n\n2. **Heat (Q)**:\n   - **Heat absorbed by the system**: Positive. When the system gains heat from the surroundings, it is considered a positive contribution to the internal energy.\n   - **Heat released by the system**: Negative. When the system loses heat to the surroundings, it is considered a negative contribution to the internal energy.\n\nThese conventions can be summarized with the general rule: if energy enters the system, it is positive; if energy leaves the system, it is negative. This framework helps in applying the first law of thermodynamics, which can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nwhere $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy of the system, $Q$ is the heat added to the system, and $W$ is the work done by the system. Understanding these sign conventions is essential for solving thermodynamic problems accurately.
