    What role did planetesimals play in the formation of Earth's core?
answer: >-
    Planetesimals played a crucial role in the formation of Earth's core through a series of processes that involved their accretion and differentiation. Here are the key points regarding their contribution:\n\n1. **Building Blocks of Planets**: Planetesimals are the fundamental building blocks of terrestrial planets, including Earth. They formed from the solid material present in the early solar system and were primarily composed of silicates and metals. As these planetesimals collided and merged, they contributed to the growth of Earth.\n\n2. **Core Formation Mechanisms**: The process of core formation in Earth involved the melting of metallic components, primarily iron and nickel, which were present in the planetesimals. The heat generated from the radioactive decay of isotopes like $^{26}\text{Al}$ and $^{60}\text{Fe}$ in these small bodies was significant enough to cause melting, allowing the metallic elements to separate from silicate materials.\n\n3. **Accretion Events**: Earth's core did not form in a single event but rather through multiple accretion events involving planetesimals that had their own cores. This multistage core formation process allowed for the gradual accumulation of iron and other metals into the growing core of Earth.\n\n4. **Differentiation**: As the planetesimals collided and merged, the heat from these impacts, combined with the heat from radioactive decay, led to the melting of the metallic components. This melting allowed for the percolation of liquid iron alloy through crystalline silicates, facilitating the separation of iron from silicate materials and contributing to the formation of a differentiated core.\n\n5. **Isotopic Evidence**: Studies of tungsten isotopes in meteorites suggest that core formation in planetesimals occurred relatively quickly after the formation of the solar system, indicating that the processes leading to Earth's core formation were efficient and occurred within a few million years.\n\n6. **Chemical Composition**: The high-pressure conditions during core formation resulted in a core that is richer in low atomic number elements, such as silicon and possibly oxygen, compared to the original planetesimals. This compositional difference is a result of the differentiation processes that occurred as the planetesimals merged and formed the early Earth.\n\nIn summary, planetesimals were integral to the formation of Earth's core through their role as accretionary bodies that provided the necessary materials and conditions for core differentiation and development. Their contributions were essential in shaping the thermal and chemical environment that led to the formation of a distinct metallic core within the Earth.
