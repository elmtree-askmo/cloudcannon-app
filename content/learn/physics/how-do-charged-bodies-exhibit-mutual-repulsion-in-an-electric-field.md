    How do charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion in an electric field?
answer: >-
    Charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion in an electric field due to the fundamental properties of electric charge. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. According to Coulomb's law, like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract. This means that when two positive charges or two negative charges are brought close together, they will exert a force on each other that pushes them apart.\n\nThe force of interaction between two point charges can be quantified using Coulomb's law, which states that the electrostatic force $ F $ between two charges $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $ separated by a distance $ r $ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $ k $ is Coulomb's constant. The direction of the force is along the line connecting the two charges. If both charges are of the same sign (both positive or both negative), the force is repulsive, pushing the charges away from each other.\n\nIn practical scenarios, such as the example of static electricity, when a child slides down a plastic slide, electrons are stripped from their hair, leaving an excess of positive charges. The positive charges on each strand of hair repel each other, causing the hair to stand on end due to mutual repulsion.\n\nThe electric field $ \vec{E} $ created by a charge at a point in space is defined as the force $ \vec{F} $ experienced by a small positive test charge $ q $ placed at that point divided by the magnitude of the charge:\n\n$$\n\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}\n$$\n\nThis electric field exerts a force on other charges placed within it, leading to the observed repulsion or attraction depending on the nature of the charges involved. Thus, the mutual repulsion of charged bodies in an electric field is a direct consequence of the interactions dictated by Coulomb's law and the properties of electric fields.
