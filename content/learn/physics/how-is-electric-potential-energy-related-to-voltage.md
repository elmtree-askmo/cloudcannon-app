    How is electric potential energy related to voltage?
answer: >-
    Electric potential energy and voltage are closely related concepts in the field of electricity and electrical principles. The relationship can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition of Electric Potential Energy**: Electric potential energy (U) is the energy stored in a system of charges due to their positions relative to each other. It is defined as the work done to assemble a system of charges from an infinite distance to their current positions.\n\n2. **Definition of Voltage**: Voltage, or electric potential difference (V), is defined as the electric potential energy per unit charge. It indicates how much work is done to move a charge from one point to another in an electric field. The formula for voltage can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   V = \frac{W}{Q}\n   $$\n   where $W$ is the work done in moving the charge and $Q$ is the amount of charge.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Electric Potential Energy and Voltage**: The relationship between electric potential energy and voltage can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$\n   \Delta PE = Q \Delta V\n   $$\n   Here, $\Delta PE$ represents the change in electric potential energy, $Q$ is the charge, and $\Delta V$ is the change in voltage. This equation shows that the change in electric potential energy is directly proportional to both the charge and the change in voltage.\n\n4. **Practical Implications**: In practical terms, it is often more convenient to use voltage rather than directly calculating electric potential energy, as voltage provides a clearer understanding of the energy per unit charge in a circuit or electric field. This is particularly useful in applications such as batteries and electrical circuits, where voltage is a key parameter.\n\nIn summary, voltage is a measure of electric potential energy per unit charge, and the two concepts are interconnected through the work done in moving charges within an electric field.
