    Can you explain the first law of reflection?
answer: >-
    The first law of reflection states that when a ray of light strikes a reflective surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\angle i = \angle r\n$$\n\nwhere $\angle i$ is the angle of incidence (the angle between the incident ray and the normal to the surface) and $\angle r$ is the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected ray and the normal). Both angles are measured relative to the normal, which is a line perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact.\n\nThis law applies to all types of reflective surfaces, including plane mirrors and curved mirrors, and is fundamental in understanding how light behaves when it encounters a surface. The reflected ray, incident ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane, which is crucial for predicting the path of light after reflection.\n\nIn summary, the first law of reflection is a foundational principle in optics that describes the predictable behavior of light when it reflects off surfaces, allowing for the analysis and design of various optical devices.
