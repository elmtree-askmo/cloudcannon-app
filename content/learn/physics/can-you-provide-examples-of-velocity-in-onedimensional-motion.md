answer: >-
    In one-dimensional motion, velocity is a vector quantity that describes the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Here are some examples of velocity in one-dimensional motion:\n\n1. **Biking Along a Straight Path**: When a cyclist rides along a straight, flat path, their velocity can be measured as the change in position over time. For instance, if the cyclist travels 100 meters east in 5 seconds, their average velocity would be calculated as:\n   $$ \n   v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{100 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ s}} = 20 \text{ m/s} \text{ east} \n   $$\n\n2. **A Car Moving on a Straight Road**: If a car accelerates from rest to a speed of 60 km/h in 10 seconds, its average velocity during this time can be calculated. Assuming it moves in a straight line, the average velocity would be:\n   $$\n   v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{(60 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}})}{(10 \text{ s} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \text{ s}})} = 16.67 \text{ m/s}\n   $$\n\n3. **Throwing a Ball Straight Up**: When a ball is thrown straight up, its velocity changes due to the acceleration of gravity. At the moment of release, if the ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 15 m/s, its velocity will decrease as it rises until it reaches the peak height, where the velocity will be 0 m/s before it starts to fall back down.\n\n4. **A Train Moving on a Track**: A train traveling at a constant speed of 80 m/s in a straight line can be described with a constant velocity. If it travels for 2 minutes, the displacement can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   \Delta x = v \cdot t = 80 \text{ m/s} \cdot (120 \text{ s}) = 9600 \text{ m}\n   $$\n\nThese examples illustrate how velocity is used to describe motion in one dimension, highlighting the importance of direction in addition to speed. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving problems related to motion in physics.
