    What is the relationship between heat capacity and temperature change?
answer: >-
    The relationship between heat capacity and temperature change is fundamentally described by the equation:\n\n$$\nQ = mc\Delta T\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $Q$ represents the heat transfer, $m$ is the mass of the substance, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. \n\nHeat capacity, which can be defined as the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius (or Kelvin), plays a critical role in this relationship. It indicates how much thermal energy a substance can absorb or release when its temperature changes. The specific heat capacity $c$ is a material-specific property that varies depending on the substance and its phase (solid, liquid, or gas).\n\nKey points regarding the relationship include:\n\n1. **Direct Proportionality**: The amount of heat transferred $Q$ is directly proportional to the temperature change $\Delta T$. This means that to achieve a larger temperature change, more heat must be added. For instance, to double the temperature change of a mass $m$, you would need to add twice the heat.\n\n2. **Dependence on Mass and Substance**: The heat transfer also depends on the mass of the system and the specific heat capacity of the substance involved. Different materials require different amounts of heat to achieve the same temperature change due to their unique specific heat capacities.\n\n3. **Extensive Property**: Heat capacity is an extensive property, meaning it depends on the amount of matter present. The specific heat capacity, on the other hand, is an intensive property, which is the heat capacity per unit mass.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between heat capacity and temperature change is crucial for understanding how materials absorb and store energy, which is essential for various applications in thermodynamics, energy management, and chemical reactions.
