    What are the relative masses of sub-atomic particles?
answer: >-
    The relative masses of subatomic particles are crucial for understanding atomic structure. Here are the relative masses and charges of the three primary subatomic particles:\n\n1. **Proton**:\n   - **Relative Mass**: Approximately 1 (more precisely, about 1.007 amu)\n   - **Charge**: +1\n   - **Location**: Found in the nucleus of the atom.\n\n2. **Neutron**:\n   - **Relative Mass**: Approximately 1 (more precisely, about 1.008 amu)\n   - **Charge**: 0 (neutral)\n   - **Location**: Also located in the nucleus alongside protons.\n\n3. **Electron**:\n   - **Relative Mass**: Approximately 1/1836 (more precisely, about 0.00054858 amu)\n   - **Charge**: -1\n   - **Location**: Orbiting the nucleus in electron shells.\n\nThe relative mass of protons and neutrons is nearly equal, and they contribute most of the atom's mass, while the mass of electrons is negligible in comparison. This is why the atomic mass of an element is primarily determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. \n\nIn summary, the relative masses of subatomic particles are:\n- Proton: 1\n- Neutron: 1\n- Electron: 1/1836\n\nThese values are often used in chemistry to simplify calculations and comparisons, as the actual masses of these particles are extremely small and typically measured in kilograms or grams.
