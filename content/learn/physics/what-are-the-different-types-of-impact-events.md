    What are the different types of impact events?
answer: >-
    Impact events can be categorized based on their characteristics and the objects involved. Here are the main types of impact events:\n\n1. **Asteroid Impacts**: These occur when asteroids collide with Earth. A notable example is the Chicxulub impact, which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. This impact was caused by an asteroid estimated to be about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) wide.\n\n2. **Meteorite Impacts**: These are smaller than asteroid impacts and involve meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere and landing on the surface. For instance, the Carancas meteorite event in 2007 involved a stone meteorite landing in Peru.\n\n3. **Comet Impacts**: Similar to asteroids, comets can also collide with Earth. These events can have significant effects due to the high velocity and volatile materials that comets carry.\n\n4. **Impact Cratering Events**: These refer to the geological formations created by the impact of celestial bodies. The Vredefort Dome in South Africa is the largest impact crater on Earth, formed by an asteroid that was at least 10 kilometers wide.\n\n5. **Mass Extinction Events**: Certain impact events have been linked to mass extinctions, such as the Permian-Triassic extinction, which is still debated regarding its causes, including potential impacts.\n\n6. **Near-Earth Object (NEO) Impacts**: These involve asteroids or comets that come close to Earth and have the potential to impact. The frequency of such impacts varies, with studies suggesting an impact frequency of one every 50–350 years for objects between 0.5 and 1 kilometer in diameter.\n\n7. **Giant Impacts**: These are significant events that can lead to the formation of large celestial bodies or significant geological changes. The leading theory for the Moon's origin is the giant impact hypothesis, which suggests that a Mars-sized body collided with the early Earth.\n\nEach of these impact events has played a crucial role in shaping the geological and biological history of our planet, influencing everything from the formation of craters to mass extinction events.
