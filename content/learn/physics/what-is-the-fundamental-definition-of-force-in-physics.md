    What is the fundamental definition of force in physics?
answer: >-
    In physics, force is fundamentally defined as a push or pull exerted on an object that has mass, which can cause the object to change its velocity. This definition highlights that force is an external agent capable of altering a body's state of rest or motion. Force is characterized as a vector quantity, meaning it possesses both magnitude (size) and direction. The symbol commonly used to represent force is the capital letter $ F $.\n\nForces arise from interactions between objects, and they can be categorized into two main types: contact forces, which occur when objects are physically touching, and non-contact forces, which act at a distance without physical contact. The unit of measurement for force in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton (N), named in honor of Sir Isaac Newton, who formulated the foundational laws of motion that describe the behavior of forces.\n\nIn summary, force is a crucial concept in mechanics, as it is responsible for maintaining or altering the motion of bodies, and it is essential for understanding the dynamics of physical systems.
