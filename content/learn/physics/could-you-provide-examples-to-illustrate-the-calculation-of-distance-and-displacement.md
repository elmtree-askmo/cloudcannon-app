answer: >-
    To illustrate the calculation of distance and displacement, let's consider a couple of examples that highlight the differences between these two concepts.\n\n### Example 1: Johnâ€™s Journey\n1. **Scenario**: John travels 250 miles north and then backtracks 105 miles south to pick up a friend.\n   \n   - **Distance Calculation**:\n     - The total distance John traveled is the sum of the distances in both directions:\n     $$\n     \text{Total Distance} = 250 \text{ miles (north)} + 105 \text{ miles (south)} = 355 \text{ miles}\n     $$\n\n   - **Displacement Calculation**:\n     - Displacement is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position, taking direction into account. Since John ends up 145 miles north of his starting point (250 miles north - 105 miles south):\n     $$\n     \text{Displacement} = 250 \text{ miles} - 105 \text{ miles} = 145 \text{ miles (north)}\n     $$\n\n### Example 2: Circular Track\n2. **Scenario**: A person walks around a circular track with a circumference of 400 meters and completes one full lap.\n\n   - **Distance Calculation**:\n     - The total distance traveled is equal to the circumference of the track:\n     $$\n     \text{Distance} = 400 \text{ meters}\n     $$\n\n   - **Displacement Calculation**:\n     - Since the person ends up at the same point where they started, the displacement is:\n     $$\n     \text{Displacement} = 0 \text{ meters}\n     $$\n\n### Example 3: Straight Line Movement\n3. **Scenario**: A car travels 5 kilometers east and then turns and travels 8 kilometers north.\n\n   - **Distance Calculation**:\n     - The total distance covered by the car is the sum of the distances traveled in each direction:\n     $$\n     \text{Total Distance} = 5 \text{ km (east)} + 8 \text{ km (north)} = 13 \text{ km}\n     $$\n\n   - **Displacement Calculation**:\n     - To find the displacement, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since the path forms a right triangle:\n     $$\n     \text{Displacement} = \sqrt{(5 \text{ km})^2 + (8 \text{ km})^2} = \sqrt{25 + 64} = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43 \text{ km}\n     $$\n     - The direction of the displacement can be found using trigonometry, specifically the tangent function, to determine the angle relative to the eastward direction.\n\nThese examples clearly illustrate the distinction between distance, which is a scalar quantity representing the total path traveled, and displacement, which is a vector quantity that considers the shortest path between the initial and final positions, including direction.
