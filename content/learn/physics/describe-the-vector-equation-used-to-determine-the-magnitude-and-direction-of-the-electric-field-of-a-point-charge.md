    Describe the vector equation used to determine the magnitude and direction of the electric field of a point charge.
answer: >-
    To determine the magnitude and direction of the electric field produced by a point charge, we can use the following vector equation:\n\n1. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: The electric field $ E $ at a distance $ r $ from a point charge $ Q $ is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}\n   $$\n   where:\n   - $ k $ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $,\n   - $ Q $ is the magnitude of the point charge,\n   - $ r $ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being measured.\n\n2. **Direction of the Electric Field**: The direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge:\n   - For a **positive charge** $ Q $, the electric field points **away** from the charge.\n   - For a **negative charge** $ Q $, the electric field points **towards** the charge.\n\n3. **Vector Representation**: The electric field can be expressed as a vector:\n   $$\n   \vec{E} = \frac{kQ}{r^2} \hat{r}\n   $$\n   where $ \hat{r} $ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point of interest. This unit vector indicates the direction of the electric field.\n\nIn summary, the electric field of a point charge is characterized by its magnitude, which decreases with the square of the distance from the charge, and its direction, which is determined by the sign of the charge. The vector equation encapsulates both aspects, allowing for a complete description of the electric field in space.
