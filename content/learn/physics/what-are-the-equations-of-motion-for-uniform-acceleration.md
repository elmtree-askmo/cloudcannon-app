    What are the equations of motion for uniform acceleration?
answer: >-
    The equations of motion for uniform acceleration describe the relationship between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time for an object moving with a constant acceleration. These equations are fundamental in kinematics and are particularly useful for solving problems involving linear motion. The three primary equations of motion are:\n\n1. **First Equation of Motion:**\n   $$ \n   v = u + at \n   $$\n   where:\n   - $ v $ = final velocity\n   - $ u $ = initial velocity\n   - $ a $ = acceleration\n   - $ t $ = time\n\n2. **Second Equation of Motion:**\n   $$ \n   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \n   $$\n   where:\n   - $ s $ = displacement\n   - $ u $ = initial velocity\n   - $ a $ = acceleration\n   - $ t $ = time\n\n3. **Third Equation of Motion:**\n   $$ \n   v^2 = u^2 + 2as \n   $$\n   where:\n   - $ v $ = final velocity\n   - $ u $ = initial velocity\n   - $ a $ = acceleration\n   - $ s $ = displacement\n\nThese equations can be applied in various scenarios involving uniform acceleration, such as a car accelerating from rest or an object in free fall. For example, if a car accelerates uniformly from rest to 30 m/s in 10 seconds, the acceleration can be calculated as:\n\n$$ \na = \frac{30 \, \text{m/s} - 0}{10 \, \text{s}} = 3 \, \text{m/s}^2 \n$$\n\nThese equations are essential tools in physics for analyzing motion and predicting future positions and velocities of moving objects under uniform acceleration.
