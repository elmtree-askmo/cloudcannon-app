    How does pressure differ when applied inside objects versus on surfaces?
answer: >-
    Pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area, and it behaves differently when applied inside objects compared to when it is applied on surfaces. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Pressure Inside Objects**:\n   - When pressure is applied inside an object, such as a balloon or a tire, it acts uniformly in all directions on the internal surfaces of the object. This internal pressure can cause the object to expand or deform, depending on the material properties and the amount of pressure applied.\n   - The internal pressure is influenced by the volume of the object and the temperature of the gas or fluid inside. For example, in an inflated balloon, the pressure inside is greater than the atmospheric pressure outside, which keeps the balloon inflated.\n   - The relationship between internal pressure and volume can be described by the ideal gas law for gases, given by $PV = nRT$, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.\n\n2. **Pressure on Surfaces**:\n   - When pressure is applied to the surface of an object, it acts perpendicular to the surface at each point. This external pressure can lead to forces that may cause the object to deform or fail if the pressure exceeds the material's strength.\n   - For example, when a fluid exerts pressure on the walls of its container, the pressure is exerted equally in all directions, and the force is distributed over the surface area of the container. This is particularly important in applications such as hydraulic systems and pressure vessels.\n   - The pressure on a surface can also vary depending on the depth in a fluid, as pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above. This is described by the hydrostatic pressure equation: $P = \rho g h$, where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the depth.\n\n3. **Effects of Pressure**:\n   - Internal pressure can lead to structural changes within the material, such as yielding or buckling, depending on the material properties and the magnitude of the pressure.\n   - External pressure can cause compressive forces that may lead to failure modes such as crushing or buckling, especially in slender structures.\n\nIn summary, while both internal and external pressures are defined as force per unit area, their effects and the contexts in which they operate differ significantly. Internal pressure influences the behavior of the material from within, while external pressure acts on the surface and can lead to different mechanical responses.
