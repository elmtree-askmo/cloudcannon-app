    How does the strength of an electric field vary with distance from a point charge?
answer: >-
    The strength of an electric field generated by a point charge varies inversely with the square of the distance from the charge. This relationship is described by the formula:\n\n$$\nE = k \frac{Q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $E$ is the electric field strength,\n- $k$ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $8.9876 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2$,\n- $Q$ is the magnitude of the point charge, and\n- $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being measured.\n\nAs the distance $r$ increases, the electric field strength $E$ decreases rapidly due to the inverse square relationship. Specifically, if you double the distance from the charge, the electric field strength becomes one-fourth of its original value. This behavior is a consequence of the geometrical spreading of the electric field lines as they radiate outward from the point charge.\n\nIn summary, the electric field strength decreases with the square of the distance from a point charge, illustrating the fundamental principle of the inverse square law in electrostatics.
