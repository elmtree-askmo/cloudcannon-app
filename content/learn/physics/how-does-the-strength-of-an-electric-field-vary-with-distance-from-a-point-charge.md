    How does the strength of an electric field vary with distance from a point charge?
answer: >-
    The strength of an electric field created by a point charge varies inversely with the square of the distance from the charge. This relationship is described by Coulomb's law, which states that the electric field $E$ at a distance $r$ from a point charge $Q$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nE = k \frac{|Q|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is Coulomb's constant, approximately equal to $8.9876 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2$. \n\nFrom this equation, we can see that as the distance $r$ increases, the electric field strength $E$ decreases. Specifically, if you double the distance from the charge, the electric field strength becomes one-fourth of its original value. This inverse square relationship is a fundamental characteristic of electric fields produced by point charges.\n\nAdditionally, the direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the charge: it points away from the charge if $Q$ is positive and towards the charge if $Q$ is negative. Thus, the electric field not only varies in strength with distance but also has a specific direction based on the nature of the charge creating it.
