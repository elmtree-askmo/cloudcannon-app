answer: >-
    An excellent example illustrating the conservation of momentum can be observed in a billiards game. When a cue ball strikes another ball, it transfers some of its momentum to the second ball. This interaction demonstrates how momentum is conserved during the collision.\n\nTo elaborate, consider the following scenario:\n\n1. **Before the Collision**: Let’s say the cue ball has a mass of $ m_1 $ and is moving with a velocity $ v_1 $. The second ball, with mass $ m_2 $, is initially at rest, so its velocity $ v_2 = 0 $.\n\n2. **During the Collision**: When the cue ball strikes the second ball, it exerts a force on it, causing the second ball to move. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n\n3. **After the Collision**: Let’s denote the final velocities of the cue ball and the second ball as $ v_1' $ and $ v_2' $, respectively. The conservation of momentum can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n   $$\n   m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'\n   $$\n\n   Since $ v_2 = 0 $, the equation simplifies to:\n\n   $$\n   m_1 v_1 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'\n   $$\n\nThis equation illustrates that the momentum lost by the cue ball is equal to the momentum gained by the second ball, thereby conserving the total momentum of the system.\n\nThis principle is not only applicable in billiards but also in various real-world scenarios, such as vehicle collisions, rocket propulsion, and even in the behavior of gas molecules in a balloon, where the total momentum remains constant despite individual particles gaining or losing momentum during collisions.
