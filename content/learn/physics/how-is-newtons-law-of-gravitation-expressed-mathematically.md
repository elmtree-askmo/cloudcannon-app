    How is Newton's Law of Gravitation expressed mathematically?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, is mathematically expressed by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( F \) is the gravitational force between two objects,\n- \( G \) is the universal gravitational constant, approximately \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),\n- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, and\n- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation encapsulates the fundamental principle that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. \n\nNewton's formulation was revolutionary as it unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, suggesting that the same force that causes an apple to fall to the ground is the same force that keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. This insight laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and has been foundational in our understanding of gravitational interactions.\n\nIn practical applications, the law can be used to calculate the gravitational force between various objects, such as the Earth and an object on its surface, or between celestial bodies. For example, if we consider a mass \( m_1 \) (the Earth, approximately \( 5.98 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)) and a mass \( m_2 \) (a person, approximately \( 70 \, \text{kg} \)) at a distance \( r \) (the radius of the Earth, approximately \( 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)), we can substitute these values into the formula to find the gravitational force acting on the person due to the Earth.\n\nThis mathematical representation not only provides a quantitative measure of gravitational force but also illustrates the inverse square nature of gravity, which is a key characteristic of this fundamental interaction in physics.
