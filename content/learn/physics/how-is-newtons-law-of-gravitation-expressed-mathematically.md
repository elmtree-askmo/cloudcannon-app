    How is Newton's Law of Gravitation expressed mathematically?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation is mathematically expressed through the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( F \) is the gravitational force between two objects,\n- \( G \) is the universal gravitational constant, approximately \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),\n- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, and\n- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis law states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. \n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Proportionality**: The gravitational force increases with the mass of the objects and decreases with the square of the distance separating them. This means that if the distance between the two masses is doubled, the gravitational force becomes one-fourth as strong.\n\n2. **Universal Application**: Newton's law applies universally to all objects with mass, explaining not only the falling of objects on Earth but also the orbits of planets and moons.\n\n3. **Vector Form**: The vector form of Newton's law indicates that the gravitational force is a vector quantity, directed along the line joining the centers of the two masses. The force exerted by one mass on another is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the second mass on the first, in accordance with Newton's third law of motion.\n\n4. **Limitations**: While Newton's law of gravitation is highly accurate for many practical purposes, it does not account for relativistic effects that become significant at very high speeds or in strong gravitational fields, as described by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.\n\n### Example Calculation:\nTo illustrate the application of this law, consider the gravitational force between the Earth and a person with a mass of 70 kg standing on its surface. The mass of the Earth (\( m_1 \)) is approximately \( 5.98 \times 10^{24} \) kg, and the average radius of the Earth (\( r \)) is about \( 6.38 \times 10^6 \) m. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{(5.98 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg})(70 \, \text{kg})}{(6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m})^2}\n$$\n\nCalculating this yields the gravitational force acting on the person due to the Earth, which corresponds to their weight.\n\nIn summary, Newton's Law of Gravitation provides a fundamental understanding of gravitational interactions, forming a cornerstone of classical physics and influencing our comprehension of the universe.
