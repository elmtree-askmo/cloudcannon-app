    How does gravitational force differ from electric and magnetic forces?
answer: >-
    Gravitational force, electric force, and magnetic force are three fundamental interactions in nature, each with distinct characteristics and behaviors.\n\n1. **Nature of the Forces**:\n   - **Gravitational Force**: This is a universal force of attraction that acts between any two objects with mass. It is always attractive and does not depend on the nature of the masses involved. The strength of gravitational force is described by Newton's Law of Gravitation, which states that the force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:\n     $$\n     F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n     $$\n     where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n   \n   - **Electric Force**: This force acts between charged objects and can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the types of charges involved (like charges repel, unlike charges attract). The electric force is described by Coulomb's Law:\n     $$\n     F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n     $$\n     where $k$ is Coulomb's constant and $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges.\n\n   - **Magnetic Force**: This force arises from the motion of electric charges and can also be attractive or repulsive. Unlike gravitational force, magnetic force depends on the orientation of the magnetic poles (north and south). The magnetic force can be described by the Lorentz force law, which states that the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by:\n     $$\n     F = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})\n     $$\n     where $q$ is the charge, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the charge, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\n2. **Strength and Range**:\n   - The gravitational force is extremely weak compared to electric and magnetic forces. For example, the electric force between a proton and an electron is approximately $8.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{N}$, while the gravitational force between them is about $3.6 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{N}$. This indicates that electric forces are nearly $10^{39}$ times stronger than gravitational forces.\n   - Both gravitational and electromagnetic forces have an infinite range, but their strength diminishes with distance. Gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance, while magnetic force can decrease even more rapidly, depending on the configuration of the magnetic fields.\n\n3. **Behavior**:\n   - Gravitational force is always attractive and acts on all masses, regardless of their charge. In contrast, electric and magnetic forces can both attract and repel, depending on the charges and magnetic poles involved.\n   - Gravitational fields are uniform and cannot be detected locally, while magnetic fields can be measured and manipulated.\n\nIn summary, gravitational force is a fundamental attractive force between masses, while electric and magnetic forces are related to charged particles and can exhibit both attraction and repulsion. The differences in their nature, strength, and behavior highlight the unique roles they play in the universe.
