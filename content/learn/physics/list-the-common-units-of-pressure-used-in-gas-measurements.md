    List the common units of pressure used in gas measurements.
answer: >-
    The common units of pressure used in gas measurements include:\n\n1. **Atmospheres (atm)**: A standard unit of pressure defined as being equal to the average atmospheric pressure at sea level. \n   - 1 atm = 101.325 kPa = 760 mmHg\n\n2. **Pascals (Pa)**: The SI unit of pressure, defined as one newton per square meter. It is commonly used in scientific calculations.\n   - 1 kPa = 1,000 Pa\n\n3. **Millimeters of Mercury (mmHg)**: A unit of pressure based on the height of a column of mercury. It is often used in medical and laboratory settings.\n   - 1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa\n\n4. **Torr**: A unit of pressure that is equivalent to mmHg. It is often used in vacuum measurements.\n   - 1 Torr = 1 mmHg\n\n5. **Bar**: A unit of pressure defined as 100 kPa. It is commonly used in meteorology and engineering.\n   - 1 bar = 100,000 Pa\n\nUnderstanding these units is crucial for converting between different pressure measurements and for applying gas laws in various scientific contexts.
