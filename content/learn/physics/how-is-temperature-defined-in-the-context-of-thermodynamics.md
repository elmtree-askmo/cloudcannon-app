    How is temperature defined in the context of thermodynamics?
answer: >-
    In the context of thermodynamics, temperature is defined as a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It serves as a quantitative indicator of the thermal state of a system. The scientific definition of temperature is more precise than everyday perceptions of hot and cold, and it is fundamentally linked to the concept of thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics provides a foundational understanding of temperature. It states that if two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and system B is also in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then systems A and C are in thermal equilibrium as well. This principle allows for the establishment of a temperature scale, as it implies that temperature is a property that can be measured and compared across different systems.\n\nThermodynamic temperature is measured using the Kelvin scale, which is an absolute temperature scale where 0 K represents absolute zeroâ€”the point at which molecular motion ceases. This definition of temperature is independent of the specific properties of the substances being measured, making it a universal quantity in thermodynamics.\n\nIn summary, temperature in thermodynamics is a fundamental quantity that reflects the average kinetic energy of particles in a system, is defined through the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, and is measured using the Kelvin scale.
