    How do you add forces that are in the same direction?
answer: >-
    To add forces that are in the same direction, you simply combine their magnitudes. This is because forces are vector quantities, and when they act in the same direction, their effects can be summed directly.\n\nFor example, if you have two forces, one of 200 N and another of 150 N, both acting to the east, the resultant force (denoted as $ F_{res} $) can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nF_{res} = 200 \, \text{N} + 150 \, \text{N} = 350 \, \text{N}\n$$\n\nThus, the resultant force on the object is 350 N directed to the east.\n\nIn general, when adding forces in the same direction, the steps are:\n1. Identify the magnitudes of the forces acting in the same direction.\n2. Add the magnitudes together to find the resultant force.\n3. Specify the direction of the resultant force, which will be the same as the direction of the individual forces.\n\nThis method simplifies the analysis of forces acting on an object, allowing for easier calculations and understanding of the net effect of multiple forces.
