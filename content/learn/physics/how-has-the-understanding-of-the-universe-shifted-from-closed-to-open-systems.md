    How has the understanding of the universe shifted from closed to open systems?
answer: >-
    The understanding of the universe has shifted from a closed to an open systems perspective, reflecting a significant evolution in both philosophical and scientific thought. Traditionally, physicists have approached the universe as a closed system, simplifying complex interactions and phenomena to create manageable models. This closed systems view posits that the universe can be fully described by its internal dynamics without considering external influences.\n\nHowever, recent philosophical discourse, particularly by thinkers like Karim Thébault, argues for embracing the openness of physical systems. This perspective suggests that acknowledging the universe as an open system—where external factors and interactions play a crucial role—can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the cosmos. The open systems approach allows for the consideration of influences beyond the immediate system, which can include interactions with other systems or the environment.\n\nAn interdisciplinary collaboration involving institutions like the University of Bristol, LMU Munich, and the University of Lancaster is working to establish a new framework for understanding the universe through this open systems lens. This initiative aims to challenge the entrenched closed systems view and explore the implications of an open universe, which may better reflect the complexities observed in cosmological data.\n\nMoreover, recent studies have suggested that the universe may not be flat, as previously thought, but could curve back on itself, indicating a more intricate structure than a simple closed system. This evolving understanding aligns with the philosophical shift towards recognizing the limitations of human understanding and the need for a more nuanced approach to cosmology.\n\nIn summary, the transition from a closed to an open systems perspective in understanding the universe reflects a broader recognition of the complexities and interdependencies inherent in cosmic phenomena, encouraging a more holistic view that incorporates both empirical and philosophical insights.
