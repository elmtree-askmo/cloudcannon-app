    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century, describes the gravitational attraction between two masses. It is a fundamental principle in classical physics that explains how objects with mass interact through gravitational forces.\n\nThe law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship can be mathematically represented by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two objects,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation encapsulates the essence of gravitational interaction, illustrating that as the masses increase, the gravitational force increases, and as the distance between them increases, the force decreases.\n\nNewton's insights into gravity not only explained the motion of celestial bodies, such as the Moon and planets, but also laid the groundwork for modern physics, influencing subsequent theories and discoveries in gravitational physics. His work established a quantitative framework that allowed for the prediction of gravitational effects, which remains relevant in both classical and modern physics contexts.
