    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century. This law describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics. It states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nMathematically, Newton's Law of Gravitation is represented by the formula:\n\n$$\nF_{G} = \frac{G(m_{1} m_{2})}{r^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ F_{G} $ is the gravitational force between the two masses, measured in newtons (N).\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $.\n- $ m_{1} $ and $ m_{2} $ are the masses of the two objects (in kilograms).\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses (in meters).\n\nThis law not only explains the gravitational force between objects on Earth but also extends to celestial bodies, allowing for the calculation of gravitational interactions in space. Newton's formulation was groundbreaking as it provided a mathematical framework that could describe the motion of planets and other celestial phenomena, thus establishing a foundation for modern physics. \n\nThe implications of this law are profound, influencing various fields such as astronomy, engineering, and even philosophy, as it connects the mathematical language of physics with the natural world.
