    To illustrate the relationship between electromotive force (EMF) and terminal voltage, let's consider a detailed example calculation.\n\n### Example Calculation\n\n**Given:**\n- EMF of the battery, $ \text{EMF} = 12 \, \text{V} $\n- Internal resistance of the battery, $ r = 1 \, \Omega $\n- Current flowing through the circuit, $ I = 2 \, \text{A} $\n\n**Formula:**\nThe terminal voltage $ V_{\text{terminal}} $ can be calculated using the formula:\n$$\nV_{\text{terminal}} = \text{EMF} - (I \cdot r)\n$$\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n1. Calculate the voltage drop across the internal resistance:\n   $$\n   I \cdot r = 2 \, \text{A} \cdot 1 \, \Omega = 2 \, \text{V}\n   $$\n\n2. Substitute the values into the terminal voltage formula:\n   $$\n   V_{\text{terminal}} = 12 \, \text{V} - 2 \, \text{V} = 10 \, \text{V}\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\nIn this example, the terminal voltage of the battery when a current of 2 A is flowing is $ 10 \, \text{V} $. This demonstrates that the terminal voltage is less than the EMF due to the internal resistance of the battery, which causes a voltage drop when current flows. \n\nUnder normal operating conditions, the terminal voltage will always be less than or equal to the EMF, as the internal resistance contributes to this voltage drop.
