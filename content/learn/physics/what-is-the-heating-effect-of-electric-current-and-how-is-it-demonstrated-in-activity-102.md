    What is the heating effect of electric current and how is it demonstrated in Activity 10.2?
answer: >-
    The heating effect of electric current, also known as Joule's heating, is the phenomenon where electric current passing through a conductor generates heat. This effect is primarily due to the resistance encountered by the electric current as it flows through the conductor. The heat produced can be quantified using Joule's law, which states that the heat generated ($H$) is directly proportional to the square of the current ($I^2$), the resistance ($R$) of the conductor, and the time ($t$) for which the current flows:\n\n$$\nH = I^2 R t\n$$\n\nThis principle is widely utilized in various electrical appliances, such as electric heaters, incandescent bulbs, and toasters, where electrical energy is intentionally converted into heat energy.\n\nIn Activity 10.2, the heating effect of electric current is demonstrated using a nichrome wire. The objective of this activity is to help students understand how electric current generates heat in a conductor. When the nichrome wire is connected to a power source, the electric current flows through it, causing the wire to heat up due to its resistance. This activity not only illustrates the heating effect but also encourages students to think about practical applications of this phenomenon in everyday electrical appliances.\n\nThe activity typically involves connecting a short length of nichrome wire to a battery and a switch (key). When the circuit is completed, students can observe the wire getting hot, which serves as a clear demonstration of the heating effect of electric current. Safety measures should be emphasized, such as not touching the wire for too long to avoid burns, and ensuring the circuit is switched off after the demonstration. \n\nOverall, the heating effect of electric current is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering and is crucial for understanding how various electrical devices operate.
