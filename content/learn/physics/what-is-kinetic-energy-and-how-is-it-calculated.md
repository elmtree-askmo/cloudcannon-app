    What is kinetic energy and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Kinetic energy is a form of energy that an object possesses due to its motion. It is defined as the energy an object has when it is in motion, and it depends on two key factors: the mass of the object and its velocity. The greater the mass and the faster the object moves, the more kinetic energy it has.\n\nThe formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is given by:\n\n$$\nKE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ KE $ is the kinetic energy,\n- $ m $ is the mass of the object (in kilograms),\n- $ v $ is the velocity of the object (in meters per second).\n\nTo calculate the kinetic energy of an object, you can follow these steps:\n1. Measure the mass of the object in kilograms.\n2. Measure the velocity of the object in meters per second.\n3. Square the velocity (multiply the velocity by itself).\n4. Multiply the squared velocity by half of the mass.\n5. The resulting value will give you the kinetic energy in joules (J), as the SI unit of energy is the joule.\n\nFor example, if you have a bicycle with a mass of 10 kg moving at a velocity of 5 m/s, the kinetic energy can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Square the velocity: $ 5^2 = 25 $.\n2. Multiply by half the mass: $ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 25 = 125 $ J.\n\nThus, the kinetic energy of the bicycle is 125 joules.\n\nKinetic energy is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction, and it is always a positive value since mass cannot be negative. Additionally, kinetic energy can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as potential energy, and vice versa, illustrating the principle of conservation of energy in physics.
