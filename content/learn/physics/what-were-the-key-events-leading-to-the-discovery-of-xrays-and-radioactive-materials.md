answer: >-
    The discovery of X-rays and radioactive materials marked significant milestones in the fields of physics and medicine. Here are the key events leading to these discoveries:\n\n1. **Discovery of X-rays (1895)**: The first and most notable event was the accidental discovery of X-rays by German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen on November 8, 1895. While experimenting with cathode rays, Röntgen noticed a fluorescent glow emanating from a nearby screen, which led him to investigate further. He realized that he had discovered a new form of radiation that could penetrate solid objects, including human tissue. This discovery was revolutionary, as it provided a non-invasive method to visualize the internal structures of the body. Röntgen's work earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.\n\n2. **Discovery of Radioactivity (1896)**: Shortly after Röntgen's discovery, French physicist Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity in uranium in 1896. Initially, he was investigating phosphorescence in uranium salts when he observed that they emitted rays that could expose photographic plates. This finding led to the realization that certain materials could emit radiation without any external energy source.\n\n3. **Curies' Contributions (1898)**: Building on Becquerel's work, Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie conducted extensive research on radioactivity. In November 1898, they isolated two new radioactive elements from pitchblende: radium and polonium. Their research not only expanded the understanding of radioactivity but also laid the groundwork for future medical applications of radioactive materials.\n\n4. **Recognition and Application (1900s)**: By the early 1900s, the scientific community recognized the significance of radioactivity. The Curies and Becquerel were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 for their contributions to the understanding of radioactivity. Following these discoveries, radium began to be used in medical treatments, particularly for skin lesions and cancer.\n\nThese key events collectively transformed the landscape of medical imaging and treatment, leading to the development of various diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that utilize X-rays and radioactive materials. The impact of these discoveries continues to be felt in modern medicine and science.
