    How is the magnitude of an electric field calculated using Coulomb's Law?
answer: >-
    The magnitude of an electric field can be calculated using Coulomb's Law, which describes the electrostatic force between two point charges. The formula for Coulomb's Law is given by:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{d^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ F $ is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the charges,\n- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $,\n- $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $ are the magnitudes of the two point charges, and\n- $ d $ is the distance between the centers of the two charges.\n\nTo find the electric field $ E $ created by a point charge $ Q $ at a distance $ r $ from the charge, we can relate the electric field to the force experienced by a test charge $ q $ placed in the field. The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge:\n\n$$\nE = \frac{F}{q}\n$$\n\nSubstituting Coulomb's Law into this equation, we can express the electric field due to a point charge $ Q $ as:\n\n$$\nE = k \frac{Q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nThis formula indicates that the electric field $ E $ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge $ Q $ and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $ r $ from the charge. The direction of the electric field is radially outward from the charge if $ Q $ is positive and radially inward if $ Q $ is negative.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the electric field produced by a point charge can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nE = k \frac{Q}{r^2}\n$$\n\nThis relationship is fundamental in understanding how electric fields interact with charges and is essential for problem-solving in electrostatics.
