    Refraction is the bending of light as it travels between different media, governed by Snell's law. It influences various optical phenomena, from the appearance of submerged objects to the operation of lenses and microscopes.

    What is refraction and how does it affect light?
answer: >-
    Refraction is a fundamental optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light travels from one medium to another and experiences a change in speed, resulting in a change in direction. This bending of light is governed by Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sines of the angle of incidence ($\theta_1$) and the angle of refraction ($\theta_2$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of light in the two media or, equivalently, to the ratio of their refractive indices ($n_1$ and $n_2$):\n\n$$\n\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}\n$$\n\nIn practical terms, when light moves from a less dense medium (like air, with a refractive index of approximately 1) to a denser medium (like water, with a refractive index of about 1.33), it bends towards the normal line (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence). Conversely, when light travels from a denser medium to a less dense medium, it bends away from the normal.\n\nRefraction is responsible for various optical phenomena, including the apparent bending of objects submerged in water (like a pencil appearing broken when placed in a glass of water) and the formation of rainbows when light passes through raindrops. It also plays a crucial role in the functioning of optical devices such as lenses and microscopes, where the bending of light allows for magnification and the focusing of images.\n\nOverall, refraction is a key concept in understanding how light interacts with different materials, influencing both natural occurrences and technological applications in optics.
