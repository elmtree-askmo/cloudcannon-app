    What is the mirror equation and how is it used in optics?
answer: >-
    The mirror equation is a fundamental relationship in optics that connects the object distance, image distance, and focal length of a mirror. It is expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_i} + \frac{1}{d_o}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- \( f \) is the focal length of the mirror,\n- \( d_i \) is the image distance (the distance from the mirror to the image),\n- \( d_o \) is the object distance (the distance from the mirror to the object).\n\n### Usage in Optics\n\n1. **Determining Image Distance**: If the object distance and the focal length of the mirror are known, the mirror equation can be used to calculate the image distance. This is particularly useful in applications where the position of the image is critical, such as in camera systems or optical instruments.\n\n2. **Finding Object Distance**: Conversely, if the image distance and the focal length are known, the equation can be rearranged to find the object distance. This is useful in scenarios where the placement of the object relative to the mirror needs to be determined.\n\n3. **Magnification Calculations**: The mirror equation can be used in conjunction with the magnification equation, which relates the heights of the object and image to their respective distances from the mirror. The magnification \( m \) is given by:\n\n$$\nm = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}\n$$\n\nThis allows for the calculation of either the image height or the object height when one is known.\n\n4. **Practical Applications**: The mirror equation is essential in designing various optical devices, including telescopes, microscopes, and medical instruments like endoscopes. Understanding how to manipulate the equation helps in optimizing the placement and curvature of mirrors for clear visibility and accurate imaging.\n\n### Example Problem\n\nTo illustrate the application of the mirror equation, consider a concave mirror with a focal length of 20 cm. If an object is placed 50 cm from the mirror, we can find the image distance as follows:\n\n1. Given:\n   - \( f = 20 \, \text{cm} \)\n   - \( d_o = 50 \, \text{cm} \)\n\n2. Using the mirror equation:\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_i} + \frac{1}{50}\n   $$\n\n3. Rearranging gives:\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{50}\n   $$\n\n4. Finding a common denominator and solving yields:\n   $$\n   d_i = 33.33 \, \text{cm}\n   $$\n\nThis indicates that the image is formed 33.33 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object, and further analysis can determine whether the image is real or virtual, upright or inverted.\n\nIn summary, the mirror equation is a powerful tool in optics that facilitates the understanding and prediction of image formation by mirrors, making it essential for both theoretical studies and practical applications in various fields.
