answer: >-
    Here are some examples of conceptual questions that could be included in exams on wave interference:\n\n1. **Wave Characteristics**: What type of experimental evidence indicates that light behaves as a wave? Provide an example of a wave characteristic of light that can be easily observed outside the laboratory.\n\n2. **Coherence**: Explain why two independent light sources, such as sodium lamps, do not produce an interference pattern. What is the significance of coherence in wave interference?\n\n3. **Interference Patterns**: In a Young's double-slit experiment, describe how the interference pattern is formed. What role do the path difference and phase difference play in determining whether constructive or destructive interference occurs?\n\n4. **Intensity and Amplitude**: If two light waves with electric field amplitudes $E_1$ and $E_2$ interfere at a point, how is the intensity $I$ at that point related to the amplitudes? Write the formula that describes this relationship.\n\n5. **Constructive vs. Destructive Interference**: Define constructive and destructive interference. How can you determine whether two waves will interfere constructively or destructively based on their phase difference?\n\n6. **Applications of Interference**: Discuss a practical application of wave interference in technology or nature. How does understanding wave interference contribute to advancements in these fields?\n\n7. **Path Difference Calculation**: In a double-slit experiment, if the path difference between two waves is given as $d$, how does this relate to the wavelength $\lambda$ for constructive interference to occur? Provide the condition for constructive interference.\n\nThese questions not only test the understanding of wave interference concepts but also encourage students to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios and theoretical situations.
