    What are the defining characteristics of brown dwarfs?
answer: >-
    Brown dwarfs are intriguing celestial objects that occupy a unique position between the largest gas giant planets and the smallest stars. Here are the defining characteristics of brown dwarfs:\n\n1. **Mass Range**: Brown dwarfs have masses that range from approximately 13 to 80 times that of Jupiter (M_J). This mass range is significant because it is not sufficient for sustained hydrogen fusion, which is the hallmark of true stars. Instead, they are often referred to as "failed stars" because they do not reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen burning in their cores.\n\n2. **Temperature**: The surface temperatures of brown dwarfs are relatively cool, ranging from about 200 to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 100 to 1,400 degrees Celsius). This is much cooler than main-sequence stars, which can have surface temperatures in the tens of thousands of degrees. The coolest brown dwarfs can have temperatures as low as 3,000 K, overlapping with those of red dwarf stars.\n\n3. **Fusion Processes**: While brown dwarfs do not sustain hydrogen fusion, they can undergo limited fusion of deuterium (a heavier isotope of hydrogen) during their early years. This process allows them to emit some light and heat, but it is not enough to classify them as stars.\n\n4. **Formation**: Brown dwarfs form in a similar manner to stars, through the gravitational collapse of gas within molecular clouds. However, they do not accumulate enough mass to ignite sustained nuclear fusion, which differentiates them from main-sequence stars.\n\n5. **Spectral Classification**: Brown dwarfs are classified into spectral types, with the coolest being classified as type L, which is characterized by an optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO). Some brown dwarfs may not exhibit these features, indicating a diversity in their spectral characteristics.\n\n6. **Role in Astronomy**: Brown dwarfs serve as an important bridge in our understanding of both planets and stars. Their intermediate temperatures and masses provide insights into the processes of star formation and the characteristics of planetary systems.\n\nIn summary, brown dwarfs are substellar objects that are too massive to be classified as planets but not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion like stars. Their unique properties make them a subject of interest in astrophysical research, particularly in understanding the formation and evolution of celestial bodies.
