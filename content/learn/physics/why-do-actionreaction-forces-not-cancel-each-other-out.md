    Why do action-reaction forces not cancel each other out?
answer: >-
    Action-reaction forces do not cancel each other out because they act on different objects. According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when one object exerts a force on a second object (the action force), the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction back on the first object (the reaction force). \n\nFor example, when a bird flies, its wings push air downwards (action force), and in response, the air pushes the bird upwards (reaction force). These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but they act on different entities—the bird and the air—so they do not cancel each other out.\n\nIt is crucial to distinguish between action-reaction force pairs and balanced forces acting on a single object. Balanced forces, which are often discussed in the context of Newton's first and second laws, act on the same object and can cancel each other out, resulting in no net force. In contrast, action-reaction forces are always present in pairs and act on different objects, which is why they do not cancel each other out. \n\nIn summary, the key reason action-reaction forces do not cancel each other out is that they act on different objects, allowing for the continued motion and interaction of those objects.
