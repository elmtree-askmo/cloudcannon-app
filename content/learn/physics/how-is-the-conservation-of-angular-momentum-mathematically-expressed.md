    How is the conservation of angular momentum mathematically expressed?
answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is mathematically expressed through the principle that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant if no net external torque acts on it. This can be represented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nThis indicates that the time derivative of the angular momentum vector $\vec{L}$ is zero, meaning that $\vec{L}$ is constant over time. In a system of particles, the total angular momentum can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\vec{L} = \vec{l}_1 + \vec{l}_2 + \ldots + \vec{l}_N = \text{constant}\n$$\n\nwhere $\vec{l}_i$ represents the angular momentum of each individual particle in the system.\n\nAngular momentum itself is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nL = I \omega\n$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the angular momentum, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity. This relationship shows that if the moment of inertia changes (for example, when an ice skater pulls in their arms), the angular velocity must adjust to keep the angular momentum constant, illustrating the conservation principle in action.\n\nIn summary, the conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that applies to various systems, and it is mathematically expressed through the constancy of the angular momentum vector in the absence of external torques.
