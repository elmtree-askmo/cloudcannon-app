    How is Newton's Law of Gravitation mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is mathematically represented by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between two objects,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects, and\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This relationship was groundbreaking as it provided a mathematical framework to describe gravitational interactions, which could explain not only terrestrial phenomena but also celestial mechanics, such as the motion of planets and moons.\n\nNewton's formulation of gravity was a significant advancement in classical physics, allowing for the prediction of gravitational forces in various contexts, from objects falling to Earth to the orbits of planets around the Sun.
