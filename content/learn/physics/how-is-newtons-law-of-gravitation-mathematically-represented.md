    How is Newton's Law of Gravitation mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation is mathematically represented by the formula:\n\n$$\nF_G = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n\n- $ F_G $ is the gravitational force between two objects,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $.\n\nThis law states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This foundational principle of classical physics explains how objects with mass interact through gravitational forces, and it has significant implications in various fields, including astronomy and physics.\n\nNewton's formulation of this law was a major advancement in understanding gravitational interactions, extending the earlier work of astronomers like Kepler, and it laid the groundwork for further developments in gravitational theory, including Einstein's theory of general relativity.
