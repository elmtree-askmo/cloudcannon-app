    What are Milankovitch Cycles and how do they influence climate?
answer: >-
    Milankovitch cycles are a set of predictable, periodic changes in the Earth's movements that influence the planet's climate over long periods, typically thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Named after the Serbian engineer and mathematician Milutin MilankoviÄ‡, these cycles are primarily driven by three key variations in the Earth's geometry relative to the Sun:\n\n1. **Eccentricity**: This refers to the shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which varies from more circular to more elliptical over a cycle of about 100,000 years. Changes in eccentricity affect the distance between the Earth and the Sun, thereby influencing the amount of solar radiation received.\n\n2. **Axial Tilt (Obliquity)**: The angle of the Earth's axial tilt changes between approximately 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle of about 41,000 years. This tilt affects the intensity of the seasons; a greater tilt results in more extreme seasons (hotter summers and colder winters), while a smaller tilt leads to milder seasons.\n\n3. **Precession**: This is the wobble in the Earth's rotation axis, which occurs over a cycle of about 26,000 years. Precession affects the timing of the seasons in relation to the Earth's position in its orbit, influencing how solar radiation is distributed across the planet.\n\nThese cycles collectively contribute to variations in solar radiation (insolation) received by the Earth, which can lead to significant climate changes, including the onset and retreat of ice ages and interglacial periods. For instance, the interplay of these cycles is believed to have played a crucial role in the timing of past glacial and interglacial periods throughout Earth's history.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while Milankovitch cycles have been instrumental in shaping Earth's climate over geological timescales, they do not account for the rapid climate changes observed in recent history, particularly since the mid-20th century. Current climate change is primarily attributed to human activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions, rather than natural cycles.
