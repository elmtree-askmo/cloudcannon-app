    What are the different types of forces in physics?
answer: >-
    In physics, forces can be classified into two main categories: **contact forces** and **non-contact forces**. Each category encompasses various specific types of forces that play crucial roles in the interactions between objects.\n\n### 1. Contact Forces\nContact forces occur when two objects are physically touching each other. Some common types of contact forces include:\n\n- **Frictional Force**: This force opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact. It can be static (preventing motion) or kinetic (acting during motion).\n- **Tension Force**: This force is transmitted through a string, rope, or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends.\n- **Normal Force**: This is the support force exerted upon an object that is in contact with a stable surface, acting perpendicular to the surface.\n- **Spring Force**: This force is exerted by a compressed or stretched spring, which can either push or pull depending on the spring's attachment.\n- **Air Resistance**: This is a type of frictional force that acts against the motion of an object moving through the air.\n\n### 2. Non-Contact Forces\nNon-contact forces act at a distance without the need for physical contact between objects. Key types of non-contact forces include:\n\n- **Gravitational Force**: This is the attractive force between two masses. The strength of this force depends on the masses involved and the distance between them.\n- **Electromagnetic Force**: This force acts between charged particles and is responsible for electric and magnetic interactions.\n- **Magnetic Force**: This is a specific type of electromagnetic force that acts between magnets or magnetic materials.\n- **Nuclear Force**: This force acts between particles in the nucleus of an atom, holding protons and neutrons together.\n\n### Summary\nForces are fundamental to understanding motion and interactions in the physical world. They can be categorized into contact forces, which require physical interaction, and non-contact forces, which can influence objects from a distance. Each type of force plays a significant role in various physical phenomena, from everyday activities to complex scientific principles.
