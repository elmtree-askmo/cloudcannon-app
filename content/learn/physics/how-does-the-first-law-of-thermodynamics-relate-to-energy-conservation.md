    How does the First Law of Thermodynamics relate to energy conservation?
answer: >-
    The First Law of Thermodynamics is fundamentally a statement of the law of conservation of energy, specifically tailored for thermodynamic systems. It asserts that within an isolated system, the total energy remains constant, even as energy is transformed from one form to another. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\Delta U = Q - W\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $\Delta U$ represents the change in internal energy of the system,\n- $Q$ is the net heat transfer into the system (with positive values indicating heat added to the system),\n- $W$ is the net work done by the system (with positive values indicating work done by the system on its surroundings).\n\nThe First Law emphasizes that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or converted between different forms. For example, in a heat engine, heat energy is transferred into the system, allowing it to perform work. This relationship highlights the interconnectedness of heat and work as methods of energy transfer.\n\nIn summary, the First Law of Thermodynamics encapsulates the principle of energy conservation by stating that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system, thereby reinforcing the idea that energy is conserved in all thermodynamic processes.
