    What are the main types of faults and how do they differ in terms of movement?
answer: >-
    The main types of faults are classified based on the direction of movement of the rocks on either side of the fault plane. Here are the primary types of faults and their distinguishing characteristics:\n\n### 1. Normal Faults\n- **Movement**: In normal faults, the hanging wall moves down relative to the footwall. This type of fault occurs due to extensional forces, where the crust is being pulled apart.\n- **Location**: Normal faults are typically found at divergent boundaries, such as mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys.\n\n### 2. Reverse Faults\n- **Movement**: Reverse faults are characterized by the hanging wall moving up relative to the footwall. This occurs due to compressional forces, where the crust is being pushed together.\n- **Location**: These faults are commonly found at convergent boundaries, where tectonic plates collide, such as in mountain ranges.\n\n### 3. Thrust Faults\n- **Movement**: Thrust faults are a specific type of reverse fault with a low-angle fault plane. The hanging wall moves up and over the footwall, similar to reverse faults but at a gentler slope.\n- **Location**: Thrust faults are also found at convergent boundaries and are often associated with mountain building processes.\n\n### 4. Strike-Slip Faults\n- **Movement**: In strike-slip faults, the movement is primarily horizontal, with the blocks on either side of the fault sliding past each other. This type of fault does not involve vertical displacement.\n- **Types**: Strike-slip faults can be further classified into:\n  - **Right Lateral Faults**: When you stand on one side of the fault and look across, the opposite block moves to the right.\n  - **Left Lateral Faults**: When you stand on one side of the fault and look across, the opposite block moves to the left.\n- **Location**: Strike-slip faults are typically found at transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Normal Faults**: Downward movement of the hanging wall (extensional).\n- **Reverse Faults**: Upward movement of the hanging wall (compressional).\n- **Thrust Faults**: Low-angle reverse faults with upward movement of the hanging wall.\n- **Strike-Slip Faults**: Horizontal movement with no vertical displacement.\n\nUnderstanding these fault types is crucial for assessing earthquake risks and the geological processes associated with plate tectonics. Each fault type plays a significant role in the dynamics of the Earth's crust and the occurrence of seismic events.
