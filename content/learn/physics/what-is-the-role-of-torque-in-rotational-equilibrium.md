    What is the role of torque in rotational equilibrium?
answer: >-
    Torque plays a crucial role in achieving rotational equilibrium, which is a state where the net torque acting on an object is zero. This means that any clockwise torques must be balanced by counterclockwise torques, ensuring that the object is either at rest or rotating at a constant angular velocity.\n\nTo understand torque, it is defined as the rotational equivalent of force. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\tau = r \cdot F \cdot \sin(\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $\tau$ is the torque,\n- $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied (lever arm),\n- $F$ is the magnitude of the force applied, and\n- $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm.\n\nIn the context of rotational equilibrium, the second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is that the sum of all torques acting on the object must equal zero:\n\n$$\n\sum \tau = 0\n$$\n\nThis condition ensures that there is no net torque causing the object to accelerate rotationally. If the torques are not balanced, the object will either start to rotate or change its rotational speed.\n\nIn practical applications, understanding torque and its role in rotational equilibrium is essential for analyzing the stability of structures, designing mechanical systems, and determining the balance points of objects. By calculating the torque for each force acting on an object and ensuring that their sum is zero, one can solve problems related to rotational motion effectively.
