    What is the mathematical representation of conservation of momentum?
answer: >-
    The mathematical representation of the law of conservation of momentum can be expressed in several ways, depending on the context of the problem. The fundamental principle states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external forces act upon it. This can be mathematically represented as:\n\n$$\np_{tot} = constant\n$$\n\nor more explicitly as:\n\n$$\np_{tot, \text{before}} = p_{tot, \text{after}}\n$$\n\nwhere $ p_{tot} $ is the total momentum of the system, which is the sum of the momenta of all individual objects involved.\n\nFor two colliding objects, the conservation of momentum can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nm_{1i}v_{1i} + m_{2i}v_{2i} = m_{1f}v_{1f} + m_{2f}v_{2f}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ m_{1i} $ and $ m_{2i} $ are the initial masses of objects 1 and 2, respectively.\n- $ v_{1i} $ and $ v_{2i} $ are their initial velocities.\n- $ m_{1f} $ and $ m_{2f} $ are the final masses (which remain the same in most cases) of objects 1 and 2.\n- $ v_{1f} $ and $ v_{2f} $ are their final velocities after the interaction.\n\nThis equation illustrates that the total momentum before the collision (or interaction) is equal to the total momentum after the collision, thereby demonstrating the conservation of momentum principle.
