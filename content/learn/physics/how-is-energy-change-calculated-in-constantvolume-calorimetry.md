    How is energy change calculated in constant-volume calorimetry?
answer: >-
    In constant-volume calorimetry, the energy change associated with a chemical reaction is calculated using the principle that the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) of the system is equal to the heat absorbed or released ($q_V$) at constant volume. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\Delta U = q_V\n$$\n\nHere’s a step-by-step explanation of how energy change is calculated in constant-volume calorimetry:\n\n1. **Setup of the Calorimeter**: A bomb calorimeter is typically used for constant-volume calorimetry. The reaction takes place in a sealed container (the bomb) that maintains a constant volume. The calorimeter is insulated to prevent heat exchange with the environment.\n\n2. **Measurement of Temperature Change**: During the reaction, the temperature of the calorimeter is monitored. The heat released or absorbed by the reaction causes a change in temperature, which is measured.\n\n3. **Heat Capacity of the Calorimeter**: The heat capacity of the calorimeter ($C_{bomb}$) is determined experimentally. This value is crucial for calculating the total heat change based on the temperature change observed.\n\n4. **Calculation of Heat Change**: The heat absorbed or released by the calorimeter can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nq_V = C_{bomb} \times \Delta T\n$$\n\nwhere $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature).\n\n5. **Determining Internal Energy Change**: Since there is no pressure-volume work done in a constant-volume system, the heat measured directly corresponds to the change in internal energy of the system:\n\n$$\n\Delta U = q_V\n$$\n\n6. **Example Calculation**: If the temperature of the calorimeter rises from 23.42 °C to 27.64 °C and the heat capacity of the calorimeter is 4.90 kJ/°C, the heat change can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\Delta T = 27.64 °C - 23.42 °C = 4.22 °C\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\nq_V = 4.90 \, \text{kJ/°C} \times 4.22 \, °C = 20.68 \, \text{kJ}\n$$\n\nThus, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) for the reaction would be:\n\n$$\n\Delta U = 20.68 \, \text{kJ}\n$$\n\nThis value represents the energy change associated with the chemical reaction occurring at constant volume. \n\nIn summary, constant-volume calorimetry allows for the precise measurement of energy changes in chemical reactions by directly relating temperature changes to internal energy changes, without the complications of pressure-volume work.
