    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. This law describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics.\n\n### Statement of the Law\nThe Law of Universal Gravitation states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{mM}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- \( F \) is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- \( m \) and \( M \) are the masses of the two objects,\n- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses,\n- \( G \) is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to \( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \).\n\n### Explanation of the Formula\n- **Direct Proportionality**: The force \( F \) increases as either mass \( m \) or mass \( M \) increases. This means that larger masses exert a stronger gravitational pull on each other.\n- **Inverse Square Law**: The force \( F \) decreases with the square of the distance \( r \) between the two masses. This means that if the distance between the masses is doubled, the gravitational force becomes one-fourth as strong.\n\n### Implications and Applications\nNewton's Law of Gravitation not only explains the motion of objects on Earth but also governs the motion of celestial bodies. For example, it can be used to calculate the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon, or between the Earth and an object falling towards it.\n\n### Example Calculation\nTo illustrate the application of Newton's Law of Gravitation, consider two masses: \( m_1 = 30 \, \text{kg} \) and \( m_2 = 50 \, \text{kg} \) separated by a distance of \( r = 4 \, \text{m} \). The gravitational force \( F \) can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{30 \times 50}{4^2}\n$$\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n$$\nF = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{1500}{16} \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 93.75 \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N}\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nNewton's Law of Gravitation is a cornerstone of classical physics, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding gravitational interactions. Its mathematical formulation not only allows for the calculation of gravitational forces but also serves as a foundation for further developments in physics, including the study of planetary motion and the formulation of modern gravitational theories.
