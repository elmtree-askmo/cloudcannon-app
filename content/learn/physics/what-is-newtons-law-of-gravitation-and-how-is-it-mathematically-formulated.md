    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687. It describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics. The law states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nMathematically, Newton's Law of Gravitation can be expressed with the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the universal gravitational constant, approximately $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis law implies that as the distance $ r $ between the two masses increases, the gravitational force $ F $ decreases, following the inverse square law. This relationship is crucial for understanding various phenomena in physics, including the motion of planets, the behavior of satellites, and the dynamics of celestial bodies.\n\nNewton's formulation of gravitation was influenced by earlier work, particularly the laws of planetary motion established by Johannes Kepler. Newton's law not only provided a mathematical framework for understanding gravitational interactions but also laid the groundwork for classical mechanics, linking mathematics and physics in a profound way. The law has been instrumental in various applications, from predicting the orbits of planets to understanding the behavior of objects under gravitational influence.
