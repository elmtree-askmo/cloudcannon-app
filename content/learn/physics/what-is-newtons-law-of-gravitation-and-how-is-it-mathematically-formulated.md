    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. This law describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics.\n\nThe law states that every mass in the universe attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the two objects,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis equation illustrates that as the distance $ r $ increases, the gravitational force $ F $ decreases following an inverse square law, meaning that the force diminishes rapidly with increasing distance. Conversely, the force increases with the mass of the objects involved.\n\nNewton's Law of Gravitation not only explains why objects fall towards the Earth but also governs the motion of celestial bodies, such as the orbits of planets around the sun and the moon around the Earth. It laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and has been instrumental in our understanding of gravitational interactions in the universe.
