    Newton's Law of Gravitation describes the gravitational attraction between two masses, formulated by Isaac Newton. It states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to their mass product and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, expressed mathematically as F = G(m1*m2/r^2).

    What is Newton's Law of Gravitation and how is it mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Law of Gravitation, also known as the Law of Universal Gravitation, was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. It describes the gravitational attraction between two masses and is a fundamental principle in classical physics. The law states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\nMathematically, Newton's Law of Gravitation is expressed by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ F $ is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two masses,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $.\n\nThis equation indicates that the gravitational force increases with the mass of the objects and decreases with the square of the distance between them. For example, if the distance between two masses is doubled, the gravitational force between them becomes one-fourth as strong.\n\nNewton's Law of Gravitation not only explains the attraction between objects on Earth but also governs the motion of celestial bodies, such as planets orbiting the Sun and moons orbiting planets. It laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and has been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations over the centuries.
