    How is electric power defined and mathematically represented?
answer: >-
    Electric power is defined as the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted in an electrical circuit. It quantifies how much energy is used or delivered over a specific period of time. The SI unit of electric power is the watt (W), which is equivalent to one joule per second.\n\nMathematically, electric power can be represented using the formula:\n\n$$\nP = IV\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ P $ is the electric power in watts (W),\n- $ I $ is the electric current in amperes (A),\n- $ V $ is the voltage in volts (V).\n\nAdditionally, electric power can also be expressed in terms of resistance $ R $ using Ohm's Law. The following formulas are valid for calculating electric power:\n\n1. $ P = I^2 R $ (where $ R $ is the resistance in ohms),\n2. $ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $.\n\nThese equations illustrate the relationship between power, current, voltage, and resistance in electrical circuits, allowing for various methods of calculating power based on the available parameters. Understanding electric power is crucial for assessing the efficiency and performance of electrical devices, such as light bulbs and appliances, which are often rated in watts.
