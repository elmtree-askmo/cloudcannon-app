    How is the electric field determined at a specific point, such as point B?
answer: >-
    To determine the electric field at a specific point, such as point B, you need to consider the contributions from all source charges in the vicinity. The electric field at point B is calculated as the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each individual charge at that point.\n\n1. **Electric Field from a Point Charge**: The electric field $ \vec{E} $ created by a point charge $ Q $ at a distance $ r $ from the charge is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2} \hat{r}\n   $$\n   where $ \hat{r} $ is the unit vector pointing away from the charge if $ Q $ is positive, and towards the charge if $ Q $ is negative.\n\n2. **Vector Sum of Electric Fields**: If there are multiple charges, the total electric field $ \vec{E}_{\text{total}} $ at point B is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each charge:\n   $$\n   \vec{E}_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{E}_i\n   $$\n   where $ \vec{E}_i $ is the electric field due to the $ i $-th charge.\n\n3. **Calculating the Electric Field**: For each charge, you will need to calculate the distance from the charge to point B and the direction of the electric field vector. The magnitude of the electric field can be calculated using Coulomb's law, and the direction can be determined based on the sign of the charge.\n\n4. **Example Calculation**: Suppose you have two point charges, $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $, located at different positions. You would calculate the electric field at point B due to $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $ separately, and then add these vectors together, taking into account their directions.\n\n5. **Superposition Principle**: The principle of superposition states that the total electric field at a point is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each charge. This means that if the electric fields due to individual charges are known, they can be added together to find the resultant electric field at point B.\n\nIn summary, to determine the electric field at a specific point, you calculate the electric field contributions from each source charge and then sum these vectorially to find the total electric field at that point.
