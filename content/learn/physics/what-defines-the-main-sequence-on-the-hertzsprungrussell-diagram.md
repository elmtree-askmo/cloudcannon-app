    What defines the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram?
answer: >-
    The main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (H-R diagram) is defined as a continuous and distinctive band that runs diagonally from the upper left to the lower right of the diagram. This band represents the majority of stars, approximately 80% to 90% of the total stellar population, which are in a stable phase of stellar evolution where they are fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.\n\nIn the H-R diagram, the vertical axis typically represents the luminosity of stars, while the horizontal axis represents their surface temperature, which decreases from left to right. The main sequence includes hot, luminous stars at the upper left (such as O-type stars) and cooler, dimmer stars at the lower right (such as M-type stars). \n\nThe relationship between luminosity and mass for main sequence stars can be described by the mass-luminosity relationship, which states that luminosity (L) is roughly proportional to mass (M) raised to the power of approximately 3.5, expressed as:\n\n$$\nL \propto M^{3.5}\n$$\n\nThis relationship indicates that more massive stars are significantly more luminous than their less massive counterparts. The main sequence is crucial for understanding stellar evolution, as it marks the phase in a star's life where it spends the majority of its lifetime, typically billions of years, depending on its mass.\n\nAs stars evolve, they will eventually leave the main sequence once they exhaust the hydrogen in their cores, leading to changes in their luminosity and temperature, which can be tracked on the H-R diagram. The main sequence serves as a fundamental tool for astronomers to classify stars and study their properties and life cycles.
