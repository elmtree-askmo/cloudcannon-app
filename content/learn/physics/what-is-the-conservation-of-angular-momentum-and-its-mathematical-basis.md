    What is the conservation of angular momentum and its mathematical basis?
answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torques act on it. This principle is crucial in understanding rotational dynamics and is derived from Newton's laws of motion, particularly the law of conservation of momentum.\n\nMathematically, angular momentum $ \vec{L} $ for a system of particles can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}\n$$\n\nwhere $ \vec{r} $ is the position vector from a designated origin to the particle, and $ \vec{p} $ is the linear momentum of the particle, defined as $ \vec{p} = m \vec{v} $ (with $ m $ being mass and $ \vec{v} $ being velocity). For a system of particles, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of the angular momenta of all individual particles:\n\n$$\n\vec{L}_{\text{total}} = \vec{L}_1 + \vec{L}_2 + \ldots + \vec{L}_N\n$$\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum can be mathematically stated as:\n\n$$\n\frac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{if } \tau_{\text{net}} = 0\n$$\n\nwhere $ \tau_{\text{net}} $ is the net external torque acting on the system. This means that if the net external torque is zero, the total angular momentum $ \vec{L} $ remains constant over time.\n\nIn practical terms, this principle explains various phenomena in nature, such as the behavior of spinning objects. For example, when an ice skater pulls in their arms while spinning, they reduce their moment of inertia, which results in an increase in their angular velocity to conserve angular momentum.\n\nThe unit of angular momentum is $ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s} $, and its dimensional formula is given by:\n\n$$\n[M L^2 T^{-1}]\n$$\n\nIn summary, the conservation of angular momentum is a key concept in both classical mechanics and modern physics, illustrating the interconnectedness of physical laws and the underlying principles governing motion.
