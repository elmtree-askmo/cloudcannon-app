answer: >-
    To calculate tension and acceleration in block and pulley systems, we can apply Newton's second law of motion and analyze the forces acting on the masses involved. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solving such problems:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the System\nConsider a simple pulley system with two masses, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), connected by a string over a frictionless pulley. Assume \( m_1 \) is hanging and \( m_2 \) is on a surface.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Directions\nChoose a positive direction for acceleration. For example, if \( m_1 \) is moving downward, we can define downward as positive for \( m_1 \) and upward as positive for \( m_2 \).\n\n### Step 3: Apply Newton's Second Law\nFor each mass, apply Newton's second law, \( F = ma \):\n\n1. For mass \( m_1 \):\n   - The forces acting on \( m_1 \) are its weight \( m_1g \) (downward) and the tension \( T \) in the string (upward).\n   - The equation becomes:\n     $$\n     m_1g - T = m_1a \quad (1)\n     $$\n\n2. For mass \( m_2 \):\n   - The forces acting on \( m_2 \) are the tension \( T \) (upward) and the weight \( m_2g \) (downward).\n   - The equation becomes:\n     $$\n     T - m_2g = m_2a \quad (2)\n     $$\n\n### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations\nYou now have two equations (1) and (2). You can solve for \( T \) and \( a \) by eliminating one variable. \n\n1. Rearranging equation (1) gives:\n   $$\n   T = m_1g - m_1a \quad (3)\n   $$\n\n2. Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n   $$\n   m_1g - m_1a - m_2g = m_2a\n   $$\n   Rearranging gives:\n   $$\n   m_1g - m_2g = m_1a + m_2a\n   $$\n   $$\n   (m_1 - m_2)g = (m_1 + m_2)a\n   $$\n   Thus, the acceleration \( a \) is:\n   $$\n   a = \frac{(m_1 - m_2)g}{m_1 + m_2} \quad (4)\n   $$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Tension\nNow, substitute the value of \( a \) back into equation (3) to find the tension \( T \):\n$$\nT = m_1g - m_1\left(\frac{(m_1 - m_2)g}{m_1 + m_2}\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified to find the exact value of \( T \).\n\n### Example Problem\nIf \( m_1 = 10 \, \text{kg} \) and \( m_2 = 5 \, \text{kg} \), and using \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):\n1. Calculate \( a \):\n   $$\n   a = \frac{(10 - 5) \cdot 9.81}{10 + 5} = \frac{5 \cdot 9.81}{15} \approx 3.27 \, \text{m/s}^2\n   $$\n2. Calculate \( T \):\n   $$\n   T = 10 \cdot 9.81 - 10 \cdot 3.27 \approx 98.1 - 32.7 \approx 65.4 \, \text{N}\n   $$\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps, you can effectively calculate the tension and acceleration in block and pulley systems. Understanding the forces at play and applying Newton's laws are crucial for solving these types of physics problems.
