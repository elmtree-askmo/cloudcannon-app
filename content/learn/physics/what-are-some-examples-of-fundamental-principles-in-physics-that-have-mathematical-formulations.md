    What are some examples of fundamental principles in physics that have mathematical formulations?
answer: >-
    In physics, several fundamental principles are encapsulated by mathematical formulations, which serve as essential tools for understanding the behavior and interaction of matter and energy. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Newton's Laws of Motion**: \n   - **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:\n     $$ \n     F = 0 \quad \text{if} \quad v = \text{constant} \n     $$\n   - **Second Law**: This law relates the force acting on an object to its mass and acceleration, formulated as:\n     $$ \n     F = ma \n     $$\n   - **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which can be expressed as:\n     $$ \n     F_{AB} = -F_{BA} \n     $$\n\n2. **Law of Universal Gravitation**: Newton's law of gravitation describes the gravitational force between two masses, given by:\n   $$ \n   F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \n   $$\n   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses, and $ r $ is the distance between their centers.\n\n3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: This principle states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum remains constant. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   L = I \omega \n   $$\n   where $ L $ is angular momentum, $ I $ is the moment of inertia, and $ \omega $ is the angular velocity.\n\n4. **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**: This law states that a change in magnetic field within a closed loop induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the wire, mathematically represented as:\n   $$ \n   \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \n   $$\n   where $ \mathcal{E} $ is the induced EMF and $ \Phi_B $ is the magnetic flux.\n\n5. **Einstein's Theory of Relativity**: One of the most famous equations in physics, $ E = mc^2 $, expresses the equivalence of mass and energy, where $ E $ is energy, $ m $ is mass, and $ c $ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThese mathematical formulations not only provide a concise representation of physical laws but also facilitate predictions and deeper understanding of natural phenomena. The relationship between mathematics and physics is profound, as mathematics serves as a language through which the laws of physics are articulated and understood.
