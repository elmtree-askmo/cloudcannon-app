    What are some examples of fundamental principles in physics that have mathematical formulations?
answer: >-
    In physics, many fundamental principles are encapsulated in mathematical formulations that describe the behavior of physical systems. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Newton's Laws of Motion**: \n   - **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n     $$ \n     F = 0 \implies \Delta v = 0 \n     $$\n   - **Second Law**: The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is given by:\n     $$ \n     F = ma \n     $$\n   - **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which can be represented as:\n     $$ \n     F_{A} = -F_{B} \n     $$\n\n2. **Law of Universal Gravitation**: Newton formulated this law to describe the gravitational attraction between two masses:\n   $$ \n   F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \n   $$\n   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses, and $ r $ is the distance between their centers.\n\n3. **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**: This law describes how a changing magnetic field can induce an electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit:\n   $$ \n   \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \n   $$\n   where $ \mathcal{E} $ is the induced EMF and $ \Phi_B $ is the magnetic flux.\n\n4. **Maxwell's Equations**: These four equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, describing how electric and magnetic fields interact. One of the equations, for example, is:\n   $$ \n   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \n   $$\n   where $ \mathbf{E} $ is the electric field, $ \rho $ is the charge density, and $ \epsilon_0 $ is the permittivity of free space.\n\n5. **Conservation of Energy**: This principle can be mathematically expressed in various forms, such as:\n   $$ \n   E_{\text{total}} = K + U \n   $$\n   where $ K $ is kinetic energy and $ U $ is potential energy.\n\n6. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: This principle states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torques act on it:\n   $$ \n   L = I \omega \n   $$\n   where $ L $ is angular momentum, $ I $ is the moment of inertia, and $ \omega $ is angular velocity.\n\nThese examples illustrate how mathematical formulations serve as a language to express and understand the fundamental principles of physics, bridging the gap between abstract concepts and observable phenomena.
