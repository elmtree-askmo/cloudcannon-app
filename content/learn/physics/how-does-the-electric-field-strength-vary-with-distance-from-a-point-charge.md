    How does the electric field strength vary with distance from a point charge?
answer: >-
    The electric field strength produced by a point charge varies inversely with the square of the distance from the charge. This relationship is described by Coulomb's law, which states that the electric field $ E $ at a distance $ r $ from a point charge $ Q $ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nE = \frac{kQ}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ E $ is the electric field strength,\n- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant (approximately $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $),\n- $ Q $ is the magnitude of the point charge, and\n- $ r $ is the distance from the charge.\n\nAs the distance $ r $ increases, the electric field strength $ E $ decreases rapidly due to the $ r^2 $ term in the denominator. This means that if you double the distance from the charge, the electric field strength will be reduced to one-fourth of its original value.\n\nAdditionally, the direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the charge:\n- For a positive point charge, the electric field lines point away from the charge.\n- For a negative point charge, the electric field lines point towards the charge.\n\nThis behavior illustrates how the electric field strength diminishes with distance and how it is influenced by the nature of the charge.
