    Contact forces are forces that occur when two objects are physically touching each other. Here are some examples of contact forces:\n\n1. **Normal Force**: This is the force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it. For example, when a book is placed on a table, the table exerts an upward normal force on the book.\n\n2. **Frictional Force**: This force opposes the motion of an object sliding or rolling on a surface. For instance, when a box slides across the floor, the friction between the box and the floor acts to slow it down.\n\n3. **Tension Force**: This force is transmitted through a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends. An example is the force experienced by a rope when a person pulls a bucket of water from a well.\n\n4. **Applied Force**: This is the force that is applied to an object by a person or another object. For example, when someone pushes a car, the force they exert is an applied force.\n\n5. **Buoyant Force**: This is the upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an object immersed in it. For example, when a balloon is submerged in water, the buoyant force acts to lift it.\n\n6. **Reaction Force**: According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. For example, when you jump off a small boat, the boat moves in the opposite direction due to the reaction force.\n\nThese examples illustrate the various types of contact forces that can be observed in everyday situations.
