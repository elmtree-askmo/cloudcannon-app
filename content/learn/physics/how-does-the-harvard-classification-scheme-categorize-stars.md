    How does the Harvard Classification Scheme categorize stars?
answer: >-
    The Harvard Classification Scheme, developed at Harvard College Observatory in the late 19th century and refined by Annie Jump Cannon in the early 20th century, categorizes stars based primarily on their spectral characteristics, which are closely related to their surface temperatures. The scheme uses a sequence of spectral types denoted by the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, arranged from the hottest to the coolest stars:\n\n- **O-type stars**: These are bluish-white stars with surface temperatures typically ranging from 25,000 to 50,000 K. They exhibit strong lines of ionized helium in their spectra.\n- **B-type stars**: Blue-white stars with temperatures between approximately 10,000 and 25,000 K.\n- **A-type stars**: White stars with surface temperatures around 7,500 to 10,000 K, characterized by strong hydrogen lines.\n- **F-type stars**: Yellow-white stars with temperatures from about 6,000 to 7,500 K.\n- **G-type stars**: Yellow stars, like our Sun, with temperatures between 5,000 and 6,000 K.\n- **K-type stars**: Orange stars with temperatures ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 K.\n- **M-type stars**: Red stars with surface temperatures below 3,500 K, where titanium oxide becomes prominent in their spectra.\n\nIn addition to these main spectral types, the classification system has been expanded to include spectral types L, T, and Y, which account for brown dwarfsâ€”objects that form like stars but do not undergo thermonuclear fusion.\n\nThe Harvard Classification Scheme is a one-dimensional system that primarily focuses on the temperature of stars, while also incorporating a luminosity classification system that categorizes stars into different luminosity classes (I for supergiants, II for bright giants, III for normal giants, IV for subgiants, and V for main sequence stars). This combination of temperature and luminosity provides a comprehensive framework for understanding stellar characteristics and evolution.
