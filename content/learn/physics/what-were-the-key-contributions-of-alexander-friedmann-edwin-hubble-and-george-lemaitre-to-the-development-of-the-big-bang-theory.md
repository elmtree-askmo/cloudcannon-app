    The key contributions of Alexander Friedmann, Edwin Hubble, and George Lemaitre to the development of the Big Bang Theory are foundational to our understanding of the universe's origins and expansion.\n\n1. **Alexander Friedmann (1922)**:\n   - Friedmann was a Russian physicist and mathematician who proposed a model of an expanding universe. His work was based on Einstein's equations of general relativity. He derived solutions that suggested the universe could be dynamic rather than static, which was the prevailing view at the time. This concept of an expanding universe laid the groundwork for the Big Bang Theory, indicating that the universe was not fixed but rather evolving over time.\n\n2. **Edwin Hubble (1929)**:\n   - Hubble was an American astronomer who provided empirical evidence for the expansion of the universe. He observed that distant galaxies were moving away from us, and the farther away a galaxy was, the faster it appeared to be receding. This observation led to Hubble's Law, which states that the velocity of a galaxy's recession is proportional to its distance from Earth. Hubble's findings were crucial in supporting Friedmann's theoretical model and helped establish the idea that the universe is expanding.\n\n3. **George Lemaitre (1931)**:\n   - Lemaitre, a Belgian priest and physicist, proposed that the universe originated from a "primeval atom," which exploded at the moment of creation, leading to the expansion of the universe. His ideas were among the first to suggest a beginning to the universe, which aligned with the implications of Friedmann's and Hubble's work. Lemaitre's concept of the primeval atom is often considered an early formulation of what would later be known as the Big Bang Theory.\n\nTogether, these three scientists significantly advanced our understanding of the universe's origins and its dynamic nature, forming the basis of the Big Bang Theory as we know it today. Their contributions highlight the transition from a static view of the universe to one that acknowledges its expansion and evolution over time.
