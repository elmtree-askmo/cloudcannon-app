    How does a compass needle deflect in the presence of an electric current?
answer: >-
    When an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around the conductor. This phenomenon is a fundamental aspect of electromagnetism. A compass needle, which is essentially a small magnet, will deflect when placed near a current-carrying wire due to the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the current and the magnetic field of the compass needle.\n\nThe deflection of the compass needle occurs because the magnetic field created by the electric current exerts a force on the needle. The direction of the deflection is determined by the direction of the current flowing through the wire. If the terminals of the battery connected to the wire are interchanged, the direction of the current reverses, and consequently, the compass needle will deflect in the opposite direction.\n\nThe magnitude of the deflection is also influenced by the strength of the current; as the current increases, the magnetic field around the wire becomes stronger, leading to a greater deflection of the compass needle. This relationship illustrates that the magnetic field produced by the current-carrying conductor is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through it.\n\nIn summary, the compass needle deflects in the presence of an electric current due to the magnetic field generated by the current, which interacts with the magnetic field of the compass needle itself. This effect demonstrates the link between electricity and magnetism, a principle that is foundational in the study of electric circuits and electromagnetic applications.
