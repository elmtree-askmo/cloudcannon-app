    How is resistance defined and what are its units?
answer: >-
    Resistance in electrical systems is defined as the opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit. It is a fundamental property that determines how easily current can pass through a conductor or component. The unit of measurement for resistance is the ohm, represented by the Greek letter omega (Ω). \n\nThe relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) is described by Ohm's Law, which states that:\n\n$$\nR = \frac{V}{I}\n$$\n\nThis means that resistance is equal to the voltage across a conductor divided by the current flowing through it. One ohm is defined as the resistance that allows a current of one ampere to flow when a voltage of one volt is applied across it. \n\nIn summary, resistance is a crucial concept in understanding electrical circuits, and its unit, the ohm (Ω), is essential for quantifying how much a material opposes the flow of electric current.
