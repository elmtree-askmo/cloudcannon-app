    What are lattice systems and unit cells in solids?
answer: >-
    Lattice systems and unit cells are fundamental concepts in the study of solid-state materials and crystallography. \n\n### Lattice Systems\nA lattice system refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of points in space that defines the periodic structure of a crystal. There are seven distinct lattice systems, which are categorized based on the lengths of their axes and the angles between them. These systems include:\n\n1. **Cubic**\n2. **Tetragonal**\n3. **Orthorhombic**\n4. **Hexagonal**\n5. **Rhombohedral**\n6. **Monoclinic**\n7. **Triclinic**\n\nEach lattice system can contain one or more types of unit cells, leading to a total of 14 different Bravais lattices, which describe the unique arrangements of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystal.\n\n### Unit Cells\nA unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice that retains the overall symmetry and structure of the entire crystal. It can be visualized as a parallelepiped, defined by its edge lengths (a, b, c) and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The unit cell serves as the building block for the entire crystal structure, and when repeated in three-dimensional space, it generates the full lattice.\n\nThere are two main types of unit cells:\n\n1. **Primitive (Simple) Unit Cell**: Contains lattice points only at the corners. For example, in a simple cubic unit cell, there is one atom per unit cell, as each corner atom contributes 1/8 of an atom to the cell.\n\n2. **Centered Unit Cell**: Contains additional lattice points in the center of the cell. Examples include:\n   - **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)**: Contains one atom at the center in addition to the corner atoms, resulting in a total of 2 atoms per unit cell.\n   - **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)**: Contains atoms at the center of each face of the cube, leading to a total of 4 atoms per unit cell.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, lattice systems provide a framework for understanding the geometric arrangement of crystals, while unit cells are the smallest units that define the structure and symmetry of these lattices. Understanding these concepts is crucial for studying the properties of solids, including their mechanical, thermal, and electrical behaviors.
