answer: >-
    Torque is a fundamental concept in mechanics that describes the rotational effect produced by a force applied at a distance from an axis of rotation. It is crucial in understanding how forces cause objects to rotate, particularly in biomechanics and engineering.\n\n### Definition of Torque\nTorque ($\tau$) is defined mathematically as:\n$$\n\tau = F \cdot d \cdot \sin(\theta)\n$$\nwhere:\n- $F$ is the applied force,\n- $d$ is the distance from the axis of rotation (the moment arm),\n- $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm.\n\nWhen the force is applied perpendicular to the moment arm, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\tau = F \cdot d\n$$\n\n### Relationship with Angular Displacement\nAngular displacement ($\theta$) refers to the angle through which an object has rotated about a specific axis, measured in radians. The relationship between torque and angular displacement is mediated through angular acceleration and angular velocity.\n\nThe kinematic equation for angular motion is given by:\n$$\n\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2\n$$\nwhere:\n- $\theta$ is the angular displacement,\n- $\omega_0$ is the initial angular velocity,\n- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration,\n- $t$ is the time.\n\n### Connection Between Torque and Angular Motion\nTorque is the rotational equivalent of linear force and is responsible for causing angular acceleration. The relationship between torque and angular acceleration ($\alpha$) can be expressed using Newton's second law for rotation:\n$$\n\tau = I \cdot \alpha\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia of the object. This equation shows that the torque applied to an object results in angular acceleration, which in turn affects the angular displacement over time.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, torque is a measure of the rotational force applied to an object, and it plays a critical role in generating angular motion. The relationship between torque and angular displacement is established through angular acceleration, illustrating how forces lead to rotational movement around an axis. Understanding these concepts is essential in fields such as biomechanics, where they help analyze human motion and the mechanics of joints.
