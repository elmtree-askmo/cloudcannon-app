    What are the three main types of plate boundaries and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    The three main types of plate boundaries are divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, each characterized by distinct geological features and activities:\n\n1. **Divergent Boundaries**:\n   - **Description**: At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move apart from each other.\n   - **Geological Features**: This movement leads to the formation of new crust, typically seen at mid-ocean ridges. As the plates separate, magma rises from below the Earth's surface to fill the gap, creating new oceanic crust.\n   - **Examples**: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a classic example of a divergent boundary where the Eurasian and North American plates are moving apart.\n\n2. **Convergent Boundaries**:\n   - **Description**: Convergent boundaries occur where tectonic plates collide or move towards each other.\n   - **Geological Features**: This interaction can result in subduction (where one plate is forced beneath another) or mountain building. Subduction zones are often associated with deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs. Mountain ranges can form when two continental plates collide.\n   - **Examples**: The Himalayas, formed by the collision of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, exemplify a convergent boundary.\n\n3. **Transform Boundaries**:\n   - **Description**: At transform boundaries, tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally.\n   - **Geological Features**: This lateral movement can cause significant seismic activity, leading to earthquakes. Unlike divergent and convergent boundaries, transform boundaries do not typically create or destroy crust.\n   - **Examples**: The San Andreas Fault in California is a well-known transform boundary where the Pacific Plate slides past the North American Plate.\n\nUnderstanding these boundaries is crucial for predicting geological events, as each type is associated with specific geological hazards and features.
