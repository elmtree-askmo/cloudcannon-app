    What is the SI unit of force and how is it defined?
answer: >-
    The SI unit of force is the newton, symbolized as "N." It is defined as the amount of force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n1 \, \text{N} = 1 \, \text{kg} \cdot \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}\n$$\n\nThis definition highlights that a force of one newton will cause a one-kilogram mass to accelerate at a rate of one meter per second squared. The newton is named after Sir Isaac Newton, in recognition of his foundational contributions to classical mechanics.
