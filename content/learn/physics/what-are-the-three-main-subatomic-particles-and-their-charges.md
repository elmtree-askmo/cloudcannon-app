    What are the three main subatomic particles and their charges?
answer: >-
    The three main subatomic particles that make up an atom are:\n\n1. **Protons**: \n   - **Charge**: Positive (+1)\n   - **Mass**: Approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), or about 938 MeV/c².\n\n2. **Neutrons**: \n   - **Charge**: Neutral (0)\n   - **Mass**: Approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), or about 939 MeV/c².\n\n3. **Electrons**: \n   - **Charge**: Negative (-1)\n   - **Mass**: Approximately 1/1836 of an atomic mass unit (amu), or about 0.511 MeV/c².\n\nThese particles are fundamental to the structure of atoms, with protons and neutrons residing in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around the nucleus in electron shells. The balance of protons and electrons determines the overall charge of the atom, while the number of protons defines the atomic number and thus the element itself.
