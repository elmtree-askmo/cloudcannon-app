    What are the different formulations of Newton's Laws in mathematical terms?
answer: >-
    Newton's Laws of Motion are foundational principles in classical mechanics that describe the relationship between the forces acting on an object and its motion. These laws can be expressed in various mathematical formulations:\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**:\n   - **Statement**: An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: This law can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     \sum \vec{F} = 0 \implies \vec{v} = \text{constant}\n     $$\n   where $\sum \vec{F}$ is the vector sum of all forces acting on the object, and $\vec{v}$ is the velocity.\n\n2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**:\n   - **Statement**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: This law is commonly expressed as:\n     $$\n     \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \vec{a}\n     $$\n   or in terms of momentum:\n     $$\n     \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\n     $$\n   where $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ is the net force, $m$ is the mass, $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration, and $\vec{p}$ is the momentum of the object.\n\n3. **Third Law (Action and Reaction)**:\n   - **Statement**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: This can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     \vec{F}_{A \to B} = -\vec{F}_{B \to A}\n     $$\n   where $\vec{F}_{A \to B}$ is the force exerted by object A on object B, and $\vec{F}_{B \to A}$ is the force exerted by object B on object A.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Rotational Analogues**: When applied to rotating bodies, Newton's laws lead to analogous formulations involving torque and angular momentum. For example, the rotational analogue of the second law can be expressed as:\n  $$\n  \tau = I \alpha\n  $$\n  where $\tau$ is the torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.\n\n- **Center of Mass**: For a system of particles, the center of mass can be defined mathematically as:\n  $$\n  \vec{R}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vec{r}_i\n  $$\n  where $M$ is the total mass, $m_i$ is the mass of the $i^{th}$ particle, and $\vec{r}_i$ is its position vector.\n\nThese formulations illustrate how Newton's laws can be expressed mathematically, providing a framework for analyzing motion and forces in both linear and rotational dynamics.
