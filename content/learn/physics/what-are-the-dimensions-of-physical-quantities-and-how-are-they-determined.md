    What are the dimensions of physical quantities and how are they determined?
answer: >-
    The dimensions of physical quantities express their dependence on the base quantities, represented as a product of symbols (or powers of symbols) corresponding to these base quantities. In the International System of Units (SI), there are seven fundamental quantities, each with its own dimension:\n\n1. **Length** (L)\n2. **Mass** (M)\n3. **Time** (T)\n4. **Electric Current** (I)\n5. **Thermodynamic Temperature** (Θ)\n6. **Amount of Substance** (N)\n7. **Luminous Intensity** (J)\n\nFor example, the dimension of length is denoted as $L$ or $L^1$, while mass is represented as $M$ or $M^1$, and time as $T$ or $T^1$.\n\nTo determine the dimensions of a derived physical quantity, one can express it in terms of these fundamental quantities. For instance, the dimension of acceleration can be derived from its definition as the change in velocity per unit time. Since velocity is defined as length per time, its dimension is $L T^{-1}$. Therefore, the dimension of acceleration is:\n\n$$\n[a] = \frac{[L T^{-1}]}{[T]} = [L T^{-2}]\n$$\n\nThis indicates that acceleration has one dimension of length, negative two dimensions of time, and zero dimensions of mass, which can also be expressed as $ [M^0 L^1 T^{-2}] $.\n\nAdditionally, some physical quantities are dimensionless, meaning they are ratios of quantities that have the same dimensions. An example of this is the angle $θ$, defined as:\n\n$$\nθ = \frac{\text{length of the circular arc}}{\text{radius of the circle}}\n$$\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of physical quantities are determined by analyzing their relationships to the fundamental quantities, allowing for a systematic understanding of how different physical phenomena relate to one another through dimensional analysis. This analysis is crucial in verifying the correctness of equations and understanding the nature of physical laws.
