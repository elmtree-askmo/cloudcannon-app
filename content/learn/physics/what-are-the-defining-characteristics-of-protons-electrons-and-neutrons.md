    What are the defining characteristics of protons, electrons, and neutrons?
answer: >-
    The defining characteristics of protons, electrons, and neutrons are as follows:\n\n### Protons\n- **Charge**: Protons carry a positive charge (+1).\n- **Mass**: The mass of a proton is approximately $1.672 \times 10^{-27}$ kg, which is equivalent to about 1 atomic mass unit (amu).\n- **Location**: Protons are located in the nucleus of an atom, contributing significantly to the atom's mass.\n- **Stability**: Protons are very stable and do not decay spontaneously.\n- **Role**: The number of protons in an atom defines the atomic number (Z) and thus the identity of the element.\n\n### Neutrons\n- **Charge**: Neutrons are neutral particles and carry no charge.\n- **Mass**: Neutrons have a mass slightly greater than that of protons, also approximately 1 amu.\n- **Location**: Like protons, neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom.\n- **Stability**: Neutrons are stable when bound within the nucleus but can decay into protons and electrons when free.\n- **Role**: Neutrons contribute to the mass of the atom and play a crucial role in the stability of the nucleus. The number of neutrons can vary in isotopes of the same element.\n\n### Electrons\n- **Charge**: Electrons carry a negative charge (-1).\n- **Mass**: The mass of an electron is negligible compared to protons and neutrons, approximately $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kg, or about 0.0005 amu.\n- **Location**: Electrons are found outside the nucleus in what is often referred to as the electron cloud, orbiting the nucleus in various energy levels or shells.\n- **Stability**: Electrons are stable and do not decay.\n- **Role**: Electrons are responsible for chemical bonding and interactions between atoms. Their arrangement in energy levels determines the chemical properties of an element.\n\nIn summary, protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus and contribute to the mass of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus and are involved in chemical interactions. The balance of these particles determines the stability and identity of the atom.
