    What are the two clauses and the condition in Newton's First Law of Motion?
answer: >-
    Newton's First Law of Motion, often referred to as the law of inertia, consists of two main clauses and a condition that describes the behavior of objects in motion and at rest.\n\n### Two Clauses:\n1. **Clause for Objects at Rest**: An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This means that if no external force is applied, the object will not start moving on its own.\n   \n2. **Clause for Objects in Motion**: An object in motion will continue to move at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This indicates that an object will maintain its velocity (both speed and direction) unless a force causes it to change.\n\n### Condition:\nThe condition that underlies these clauses is the presence of **unbalanced forces**. If the net force acting on an object is zero (i.e., all forces are balanced), the object will either remain at rest or continue moving uniformly. Conversely, if there is a net force acting on the object, it will experience a change in its state of motion, either accelerating or decelerating.\n\nIn summary, Newton's First Law emphasizes the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion, encapsulated in the concept of inertia. This foundational principle is crucial for understanding the dynamics of motion in classical mechanics.
