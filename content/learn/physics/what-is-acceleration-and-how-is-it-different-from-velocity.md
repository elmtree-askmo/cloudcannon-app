    What is acceleration, and how is it different from velocity?
answer: >-
    Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It quantifies how quickly an object is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Mathematically, acceleration can be expressed using the formula:\n\n$$\na = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}\n$$\n\nwhere \( a \) is acceleration, \( \Delta v \) is the change in velocity, \( v_f \) is the final velocity, \( v_i \) is the initial velocity, and \( \Delta t \) is the time interval over which the change occurs. The SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²), indicating how much the velocity of an object changes per second.\n\nIn contrast, velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. It is a vector quantity that includes both speed (the magnitude of motion) and direction. The formula for velocity is given by:\n\n$$\nv = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\n$$\n\nwhere \( v \) is velocity, \( \Delta x \) is the change in position, and \( \Delta t \) is the time interval.\n\nThe key differences between acceleration and velocity are:\n\n1. **Definition**: \n   - Velocity measures how fast an object is moving and in which direction.\n   - Acceleration measures how quickly the velocity of an object is changing.\n\n2. **Units**: \n   - The unit of velocity is meters per second (m/s).\n   - The unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²).\n\n3. **Nature**: \n   - Velocity can be constant (uniform motion) or variable (changing speed or direction).\n   - Acceleration indicates a change in velocity, which can be positive (speeding up), negative (slowing down), or zero (constant velocity).\n\nBoth acceleration and velocity are fundamental concepts in kinematics, which is the study of motion. Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing the motion of objects in physics.
