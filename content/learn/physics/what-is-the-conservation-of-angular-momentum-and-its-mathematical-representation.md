    What is the conservation of angular momentum and its mathematical representation?
answer: >-
    The conservation of angular momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external torques are acting on it. This principle is crucial for understanding the behavior of rotating objects and is applicable in various physical phenomena, including mechanics and astrophysics.\n\nMathematically, angular momentum ($L$) can be defined in two equivalent forms:\n\n1. For a point mass, angular momentum is given by:\n   $$\n   L = r \times p\n   $$\n   where $r$ is the position vector from the axis of rotation to the point mass, and $p$ is the linear momentum of the mass, defined as $p = mv$ (with $m$ being the mass and $v$ the velocity).\n\n2. For a rigid body, angular momentum can also be expressed as:\n   $$\n   L = I \omega\n   $$\n   where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum can be mathematically represented as:\n$$\n\frac{d \vec{L}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis equation indicates that the rate of change of angular momentum ($\vec{L}$) with respect to time is zero when no net external torque is applied, implying that $\vec{L}$ remains constant.\n\nAn illustrative example of this principle is seen in the behavior of an ice skater. When the skater pulls her arms in while spinning, she reduces her moment of inertia, which results in an increase in her angular velocity to conserve angular momentum.\n\nOverall, the conservation of angular momentum is a powerful tool in solving complex rotational problems and is deeply connected to the symmetry of physical laws.
