    What are the relative charges of sub-atomic particles?
answer: >-
    The relative charges of the three main sub-atomic particles are as follows:\n\n1. **Proton**: The proton carries a positive charge of +1. It is located in the nucleus of the atom and has a relative mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu).\n\n2. **Neutron**: The neutron has no charge, which is represented as 0. It is also located in the nucleus alongside protons and has a relative mass of approximately 1 amu, similar to that of protons.\n\n3. **Electron**: The electron carries a negative charge of -1. It is found in the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus and has a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons, approximately 1/1840 of an amu.\n\nIn summary, the relative charges are:\n- Proton: +1\n- Neutron: 0\n- Electron: -1\n\nThese charges play a crucial role in the behavior of atoms, particularly in how they interact with electric fields and form chemical bonds.
