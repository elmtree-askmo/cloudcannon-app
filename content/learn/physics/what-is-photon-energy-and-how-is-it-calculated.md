    What is photon energy and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Photon energy is the energy carried by a single photon, which is the smallest unit of light. The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its electromagnetic frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that as the frequency of a photon increases, its energy also increases, while a longer wavelength corresponds to lower energy.\n\nThe energy of a photon can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\n1. Using frequency:\n   $$ E = hf $$\n   where:\n   - $ E $ is the energy of the photon,\n   - $ h $ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J⋅s}$),\n   - $ f $ is the frequency of the photon in Hertz (Hz).\n\n2. Using wavelength:\n   $$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$\n   where:\n   - $ c $ is the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$),\n   - $ \lambda $ is the wavelength of the photon in meters.\n\nTo calculate the energy of a photon from its wavelength, you can follow these steps:\n1. Convert the wavelength from nanometers (if necessary) to meters.\n2. Use the formula $ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $ to find the energy in joules.\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 520 nm (which is $520 \times 10^{-9}$ m), you would substitute the values into the formula:\n\n$$\nE = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J⋅s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{520 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}} \approx 2.38 \, \text{eV}\n$$\n\nThis calculation shows that the energy of a single photon of green light (520 nm) is approximately 2.38 electron volts (eV). \n\nUnderstanding photon energy is crucial in various fields, including quantum mechanics, thermochemistry, and the study of electromagnetic radiation.
