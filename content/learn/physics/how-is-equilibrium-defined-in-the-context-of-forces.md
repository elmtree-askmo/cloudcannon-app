    How is equilibrium defined in the context of forces?
answer: >-
    In the context of forces, equilibrium is defined as a state where all the forces acting on an object are balanced, resulting in no net force and no acceleration. This means that if an object is at rest, it will remain at rest, and if it is in motion, it will continue to move at a constant velocity. The concept of equilibrium is crucial for understanding how forces interact and how objects respond to those forces.\n\nThere are two primary types of equilibrium in mechanics:\n\n1. **Static Equilibrium**: This occurs when the net force and net torque acting on a body are both zero, meaning the body is at rest. In this state, the object does not move or rotate.\n\n2. **Dynamic Equilibrium**: This occurs when an object is moving at a constant velocity, which also implies that the net force and net torque are zero. The object maintains its motion without any change in speed or direction.\n\nIn summary, a system is in equilibrium when all the forces are balanced, leading to no resultant force or torque. This results in the object either remaining at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line, adhering to Newton's first law of motion.
