    What is the Local Super Cluster and how is it structured?
answer: >-
    The Local Supercluster, also known as the Laniakea Supercluster, is a significant structure in the universe that encompasses the Virgo Cluster and the Local Group, which includes the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, among others. It is a flattened structure with a diameter of approximately 50 megaparsecs (about 160 million light-years), containing at least 100 galaxy groups and clusters.\n\nThe Local Supercluster is centered around the Virgo Cluster, which is the most prominent collection of galaxies within this region. The Local Group, which consists of the Milky Way and its neighboring galaxies, is located on the outskirts of the Local Supercluster. The overall structure of the Local Supercluster is complex, as it is part of a larger cosmic web where clusters of galaxies are interconnected, separated by vast voids.\n\nIn terms of its geometry, the Local Supercluster defines the supergalactic plane and serves as a reference for the supergalactic coordinate system. This structure plays a crucial role in understanding the distribution of galaxies in our local universe and has encouraged astronomers to explore further into the cosmos.\n\nThe Local Supercluster is one of about 10 million superclusters identified in the observable universe, highlighting the vastness and complexity of cosmic structures. Its precise boundaries are challenging to define, as the local enhancement of galaxies gradually transitions into the cosmic background, making it a subject of ongoing research in cosmology.
