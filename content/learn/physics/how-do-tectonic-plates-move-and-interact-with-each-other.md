    How do tectonic plates move and interact with each other?
answer: >-
    Tectonic plates move and interact with each other through a combination of forces and processes that are fundamental to the theory of plate tectonics. The Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and the upper mantle, is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on a partially molten layer called the asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is primarily driven by convection currents in the mantle, which are caused by the heat from the Earth's interior.\n\nThere are three main types of plate boundaries where these interactions occur:\n\n1. **Convergent Boundaries**: At convergent boundaries, tectonic plates move toward each other and collide. This can result in one plate being forced beneath another in a process known as subduction, leading to the formation of mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches, and volcanic activity. For example, the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate has created the Himalayas.\n\n2. **Divergent Boundaries**: Divergent boundaries occur where tectonic plates move apart from each other. This movement allows magma to rise from the mantle, creating new crust as it cools. This process is commonly observed at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where new oceanic crust is formed.\n\n3. **Transform Boundaries**: At transform boundaries, plates slide past one another horizontally. This lateral movement can cause significant friction and lead to earthquakes. A well-known example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California.\n\nThe movement of tectonic plates is not uniform; they can move at different rates, typically ranging from two to 15 centimeters (one to six inches) per year. The interactions at plate boundaries are responsible for many geological phenomena, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of various landforms.\n\nIn summary, tectonic plates move and interact through the forces generated by mantle convection, and their interactions at boundaries can lead to significant geological changes on Earth.
