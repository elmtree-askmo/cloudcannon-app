    How does molecular kinetic energy relate to temperature?
answer: >-
    Molecular kinetic energy is fundamentally related to temperature through the principles of the kinetic molecular theory. According to this theory, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nKE_{avg} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T\n$$\n\nwhere $ KE_{avg} $ is the average kinetic energy, $ k_B $ is the Boltzmann constant, and $ T $ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin.\n\nAs the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. This means that the molecules move faster at higher temperatures. Specifically, a rise in temperature results in an increase in the average velocity of the gas molecules, which can be understood through the kinetic energy formula:\n\n$$\nKE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2\n$$\n\nwhere $ m $ is the mass of the molecule and $ v $ is its velocity. As temperature increases, the average velocity $ v $ of the molecules increases, leading to a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nThis relationship has significant implications for the behavior of gases. For instance, at a constant temperature, different gases will have the same average kinetic energy if they are at the same temperature, regardless of their molecular mass. This is why lighter gases, such as helium, will move faster than heavier gases, like carbon dioxide, at the same temperature.\n\nIn summary, molecular kinetic energy is directly related to temperature, with higher temperatures corresponding to greater average kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas. This relationship is a cornerstone of the kinetic molecular theory and helps explain various gas behaviors, including pressure and temperature relationships.
