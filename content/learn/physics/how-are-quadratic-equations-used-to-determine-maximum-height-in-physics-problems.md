    How are quadratic equations used to determine maximum height in physics problems?
answer: >-
    Quadratic equations play a crucial role in determining the maximum height of projectiles in physics problems, particularly in the context of projectile motion. The height of an object thrown into the air can often be modeled by a quadratic function, which takes the general form:\n\n$$\nh(t) = at^2 + bt + c\n$$\n\nwhere \( h(t) \) represents the height at time \( t \), and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the motion. In projectile motion, the coefficient \( a \) is typically negative due to the downward acceleration caused by gravity.\n\n### Finding Maximum Height\n\nTo find the maximum height of the projectile, we need to determine the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation. The vertex form of a quadratic function provides the maximum (or minimum) value, which occurs at the x-coordinate given by:\n\n$$\nt = -\frac{b}{2a}\n$$\n\nOnce we have the time \( t \) at which the maximum height occurs, we can substitute this value back into the height equation to find the maximum height \( h \).\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nFor instance, consider the height of a projectile given by the equation:\n\n$$\nh(t) = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t + 58.8\n$$\n\nHere, \( a = -4.9 \) and \( b = 19.6 \). To find the time at which the maximum height occurs:\n\n$$\nt = -\frac{19.6}{2 \times -4.9} = 2 \text{ seconds}\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute \( t = 2 \) back into the height equation:\n\n$$\nh(2) = -4.9(2)^2 + 19.6(2) + 58.8 = 78.4 \text{ meters}\n$$\n\nThus, the maximum height reached by the projectile is 78.4 meters, occurring at 2 seconds after launch.\n\n### Application in Physics\n\nThis method of using quadratic equations to find maximum height is widely applicable in various physics problems involving projectiles, such as balls thrown, rockets launched, or any object moving under the influence of gravity. The principles of kinematics and the effects of gravity are encapsulated in these quadratic models, allowing for precise calculations of motion characteristics.\n\nIn summary, quadratic equations are essential tools in physics for modeling the trajectory of projectiles and determining their maximum heights, leveraging the properties of parabolas and the vertex formula.
