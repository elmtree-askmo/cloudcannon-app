    What is the vector sum of electric fields?
answer: >-
    The vector sum of electric fields is determined by the principle of superposition, which states that the total electric field at a point in space is the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each individual charge present in the vicinity. This means that each charge creates its own electric field independently of the others, and the resultant electric field at any point is obtained by adding these individual electric field vectors together.\n\nFor example, if we have two electric fields at a point, represented as $\vec{E}_1$ and $\vec{E}_2$, the net electric field $\vec{E}_{\text{net}}$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\vec{E}_{\text{net}} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2\n$$\n\nIf $\vec{E}_1 = 3\hat{x} \, \text{N/C}$ and $\vec{E}_2 = 4\hat{y} \, \text{N/C}$, then the net electric field would be:\n\n$$\n\vec{E}_{\text{net}} = (3\hat{x} + 4\hat{y}) \, \text{N/C}\n$$\n\nTo find the magnitude of this resultant electric field, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$\nE = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \, \text{N/C}\n$$\n\nThis demonstrates how the vector sum of electric fields works, allowing us to calculate the total electric field at a point due to multiple source charges. The direction of the resultant electric field is determined by the directions of the individual electric field vectors being summed.
