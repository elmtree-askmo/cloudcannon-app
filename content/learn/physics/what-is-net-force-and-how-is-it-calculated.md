    What is net force and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Net force is defined as the total force acting on an object when all individual forces are combined. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The net force plays a crucial role in understanding the motion and behavior of objects, as it determines how an object will accelerate according to Newton's Second Law of Motion.\n\nTo calculate the net force, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify all the forces acting on the object**: This includes all pushes and pulls, which can be represented as vectors.\n\n2. **Draw a free-body diagram**: This visual representation helps to clearly see all the forces acting on the object, including their directions.\n\n3. **Sum the forces**: If the forces are acting in the same direction, you add their magnitudes. If they are acting in opposite directions, you subtract the smaller force from the larger one. The formula for net force can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   F_{\text{net}} = F_1 + F_2 + ... + F_n\n   $$\n   where $ F_1, F_2, ..., F_n $ are the individual forces acting on the object.\n\n4. **Consider the direction**: The resulting net force will have the direction of the larger force if the forces are opposing each other.\n\nFor example, if an object experiences a force of 10 N to the right and a force of 4 N to the left, the net force can be calculated as:\n$$\nF_{\text{net}} = 10 \, \text{N} - 4 \, \text{N} = 6 \, \text{N} \text{ to the right}.\n$$\n\nIn summary, the net force is calculated by vector addition of all forces acting on an object, and it is essential for predicting the object's motion according to Newton's laws.
