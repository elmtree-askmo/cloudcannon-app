    How does diffraction differ from refraction in wave behavior?
answer: >-
    Diffraction and refraction are two distinct phenomena that describe how waves behave when they encounter obstacles or transition between different media.\n\n**Diffraction** refers to the bending and spreading of waves when they encounter an obstacle or pass through a narrow opening. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave. For example, when light waves pass through a slit, they spread out and create patterns of light and dark bands due to interference. Diffraction illustrates the wave nature of light and other types of waves, such as sound.\n\n**Refraction**, on the other hand, is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium to another, which is caused by a change in their speed. When a wave enters a medium with a different density, its speed changes, leading to a change in direction. For instance, when light travels from air into water, it slows down and bends towards the normal line (an imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary between the two media). The law of refraction can be mathematically expressed using Snell's law:\n\n$$\nn_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2\n$$\n\nwhere $ n_1 $ and $ n_2 $ are the indices of refraction for the first and second media, and $ \theta_1 $ and $ \theta_2 $ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between diffraction and refraction are:\n- **Diffraction** involves the spreading of waves around obstacles or through openings, while **refraction** involves the bending of waves due to a change in speed as they move between different media.\n- Diffraction is more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is similar to the wavelength of the wave, whereas refraction is dependent on the properties of the two media involved.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for applications in optics, acoustics, and various fields of physics.
