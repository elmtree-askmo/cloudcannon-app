    How is angular momentum conserved in physical systems?
answer: >-
    Angular momentum conservation is a fundamental principle in physics that applies to various physical systems, particularly in mechanics and astrophysics. The principle states that if the net external torque acting on a system is zero, then the angular momentum of that system remains constant. This is analogous to the conservation of linear momentum, which holds when the net external force is zero.\n\nMathematically, angular momentum $L$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nL = I \omega\n$$\n\nor \n\n$$\nL = r \times p\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\omega$ is the angular velocity, $r$ is the radius vector from the axis of rotation to the point of interest, and $p$ is the linear momentum.\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum can be observed in various scenarios. For example, when an ice skater pulls in their arms while spinning, the moment of inertia decreases, leading to an increase in angular velocity to conserve angular momentum. This is because the net torque on the skater is very close to zero due to minimal friction between the skates and the ice.\n\nAnother significant example is the formation of the solar system. The solar system coalesced from a rotating cloud of gas and dust. As gravitational forces caused the cloud to contract, the rotation rate increased, demonstrating the conservation of angular momentum.\n\nIn summary, angular momentum is conserved in a closed system where no external torques are acting. This principle is crucial for understanding various physical phenomena, from the motion of celestial bodies to the dynamics of everyday objects.
