    How is angular momentum conserved in physical systems?
answer: >-
    Angular momentum conservation is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant if no external torques act on it. This principle is a rotational counterpart to the conservation of linear momentum and is deeply rooted in Newton's laws of motion.\n\nMathematically, angular momentum $L$ can be defined in two ways:\n\n1. As the product of the moment of inertia $I$ and the angular velocity $\omega$:\n   $$\n   L = I \omega\n   $$\n\n2. As the cross product of the position vector $r$ and the linear momentum $p$:\n   $$\n   L = r \times p\n   $$\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum can be observed in various physical systems. For instance, when an ice skater pulls her arms in while spinning, she reduces her moment of inertia, which causes her to spin faster to conserve angular momentum. This occurs because the net torque acting on her is very close to zero, allowing her angular momentum to remain constant.\n\nAnother example is found in celestial mechanics, where the conservation of angular momentum explains the orbits of planets. As a cloud of gas and dust contracts under gravitational forces, its rotation rate increases due to the conservation of angular momentum, leading to the formation of solar systems.\n\nIn summary, angular momentum is conserved in a system when the net external torque is zero. This principle is crucial in understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of spinning objects to the dynamics of celestial bodies, and it highlights the underlying unity in the laws of physics.
