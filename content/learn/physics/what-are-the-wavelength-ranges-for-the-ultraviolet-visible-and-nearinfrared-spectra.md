    What are the wavelength ranges for the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra?
answer: >-
    The wavelength ranges for the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectra are as follows:\n\n1. **Ultraviolet (UV) Spectrum**: \n   - The UV spectrum ranges from approximately **10 nm to 400 nm**.\n   - It is further divided into three categories:\n     - **UVA**: 320-400 nm\n     - **UVB**: 280-320 nm\n     - **UVC**: 100-280 nm\n\n2. **Visible Spectrum**: \n   - The visible spectrum, which is the range of light visible to the human eye, spans from approximately **400 nm (violet)** to **700 nm (red)**.\n\n3. **Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectrum**: \n   - The near-infrared region begins just beyond the visible spectrum, starting at about **700 nm** and extending to around **800 nm** or more, depending on the specific definitions used. The broader infrared spectrum can extend up to **1 mm**.\n\nThese ranges are important in various applications, including spectroscopy, photography, and understanding light-matter interactions.
