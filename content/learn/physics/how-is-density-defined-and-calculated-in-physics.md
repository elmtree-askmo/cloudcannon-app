    How is density defined and calculated in physics?
answer: >-
    In physics, density is defined as a fundamental physical property that quantifies how much mass is contained within a given volume of a substance. It is a measure of how tightly packed the matter in a substance is. The relationship between mass and volume can be expressed mathematically with the formula:\n\n$$\n\rho = \frac{m}{V}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $\rho$ (rho) represents density,\n- $m$ is the mass of the substance, and\n- $V$ is the volume it occupies.\n\nDensity is typically measured in units such as grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) or kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). For example, the density of water is approximately 1 g/cm³, while the average density of Earth is about 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nDensity plays a crucial role in various physical phenomena, including buoyancy, where it helps determine whether an object will float or sink in a fluid. The concept of density is also essential in fields such as chemistry and engineering, where it aids in understanding material properties and behaviors.\n\nTo calculate density, one can rearrange the formula to find mass or volume if the other two quantities are known:\n\n- To find mass: \n$$\nm = \rho \cdot V\n$$\n\n- To find volume:\n$$\nV = \frac{m}{\rho}\n$$\n\nUnderstanding density and its calculation is fundamental in both theoretical and applied physics, as it provides insights into the characteristics of materials and their interactions.
