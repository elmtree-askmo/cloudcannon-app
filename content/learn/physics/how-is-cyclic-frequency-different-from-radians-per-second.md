    How is cyclic frequency different from radians per second?
answer: >-
    Cyclic frequency and radians per second are two ways to express frequency, but they refer to different concepts.\n\n1. **Cyclic Frequency**: This is typically measured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). It represents the number of complete cycles of a periodic waveform that occur in one second. The relationship between cyclic frequency $ f $ and the period $ T_p $ of the waveform is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   f = \frac{1}{T_p}\n   $$\n   where $ T_p $ is the time taken for one complete cycle.\n\n2. **Radians per Second**: This is known as angular frequency, denoted by $ \omega $ (omega). It measures the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform and is expressed in radians per second. The relationship between angular frequency and cyclic frequency is given by:\n   $$\n   \omega = 2\pi f\n   $$\n   This means that for every complete cycle (which corresponds to $ 2\pi $ radians), the angular frequency is scaled by $ 2\pi $.\n\nIn summary, while cyclic frequency (in Hz) counts the number of cycles per second, radians per second (angular frequency) measures how quickly the angle changes in a circular motion. Both are related, but they serve different purposes in the analysis of periodic functions and waveforms.
