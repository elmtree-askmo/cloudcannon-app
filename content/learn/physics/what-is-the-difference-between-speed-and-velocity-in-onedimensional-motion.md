    What is the difference between speed and velocity in one-dimensional motion?
answer: >-
    In one-dimensional motion, the distinction between speed and velocity is fundamental in understanding how objects move. \n\n**Speed** is defined as a scalar quantity that measures how quickly an object is moving, without regard to its direction. It is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. The formula for average speed can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\n$$\n\nFor example, if a car travels 100 kilometers in 2 hours, its speed is 50 kilometers per hour (km/h).\n\n**Velocity**, on the other hand, is a vector quantity that not only includes the speed of the object but also the direction of its motion. This means that velocity provides more information than speed, as it indicates how the position of an object changes over time. The formula for average velocity is given by:\n\n$$\n\text{Average Velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Total Time}}\n$$\n\nDisplacement refers to the change in position of the object, which is a vector quantity. For instance, if the same car travels 100 kilometers east and then returns to its starting point, its average speed would still be 50 km/h, but its average velocity would be 0 km/h, since the displacement is zero.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between speed and velocity in one-dimensional motion are:\n- **Speed** is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while **velocity** is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction).\n- Speed measures the total distance traveled, whereas velocity measures the change in position (displacement) over time.\n- An object can have a constant speed while changing its velocity if it changes direction.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for analyzing motion in physics, especially in practical problem-solving scenarios.
