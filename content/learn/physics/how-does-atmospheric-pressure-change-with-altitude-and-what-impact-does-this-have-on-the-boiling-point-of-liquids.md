    How does atmospheric pressure change with altitude and what impact does this have on the boiling point of liquids?
answer: >-
    Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, which affects the density of air. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is approximately 1,014 millibars (14.7 pounds per square inch). As one ascends, such as to an elevation of 10 km (about 30,000 feet), the pressure drops significantly to around 265 millibars, which is less than 30% of the pressure at sea level. This reduction in pressure occurs because there is less air above a given point as altitude increases, resulting in a decrease in the weight of the air column exerting pressure on the surface.\n\nThe impact of this decrease in atmospheric pressure on the boiling point of liquids, particularly water, is significant. The boiling point is defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. As altitude increases and atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of water also decreases. \n\nAt sea level, water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). However, for every approximately 500 feet increase in altitude, the boiling point of water drops by about 0.9 °F (or roughly 1 °C). For example, in high-altitude locations like Denver, which is situated at about 5,280 feet (1,609 meters), water boils at around 95 °C (203 °F). This phenomenon is crucial for cooking and food preparation at high altitudes, as it affects cooking times and methods.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between atmospheric pressure and boiling point is direct: as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the boiling point of liquids also decreases, requiring less heat for the liquid to reach its boiling point.
