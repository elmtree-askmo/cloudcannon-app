    The Universal Law of Gravitation determines the gravitational force between two masses with the formula F = G (m1 m2)/r^2, where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the masses. This law is essential for understanding the forces acting between objects in the universe.

    What is the mathematical expression for the Universal Law of Gravitation?
answer: >-
    The mathematical expression for the Universal Law of Gravitation, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is given by:\n\n$$\nF = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nIn this equation:\n- $ F $ represents the gravitational force between two masses,\n- $ G $ is the gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2/\text{kg}^2 $,\n- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,\n- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nThis law explains the gravitational attraction between any two masses in the universe and is fundamental in understanding both celestial mechanics and the behavior of objects on Earth.
