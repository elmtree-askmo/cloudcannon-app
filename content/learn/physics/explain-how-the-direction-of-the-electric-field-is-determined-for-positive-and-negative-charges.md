    Explain how the direction of the electric field is determined for positive and negative charges.
answer: >-
    The direction of the electric field is fundamentally linked to the nature of the charge creating it. The electric field direction is defined as the direction that a positive test charge would move if placed in the field. Hereâ€™s how it works for both positive and negative charges:\n\n1. **Positive Point Charge**: \n   - The electric field generated by a positive point charge points **radially outward** from the charge. This means that if you were to place a positive test charge in the vicinity of a positive charge, it would experience a force pushing it away from the source charge. This outward direction is consistent with the repulsive nature of like charges.\n\n2. **Negative Point Charge**: \n   - Conversely, the electric field created by a negative point charge points **radially inward** toward the charge. If a positive test charge were placed near a negative charge, it would be attracted to the negative charge, moving towards it. This inward direction reflects the attractive force between opposite charges.\n\n### Summary of Electric Field Direction:\n- **Positive Charge**: Electric field points outward.\n- **Negative Charge**: Electric field points inward.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for understanding how charges interact in electrostatic situations. The electric field not only indicates the direction of force on a positive test charge but also helps in calculating the resultant electric fields when multiple charges are present, using principles such as superposition. \n\nIn summary, the electric field direction is determined by the nature of the charge creating it, with positive charges radiating outward and negative charges drawing inward.
