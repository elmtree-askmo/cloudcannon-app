    Several fundamental laws in physics rely heavily on mathematics, illustrating the deep interconnection between these two fields. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Newton's Laws of Motion**: These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics. They can be expressed mathematically as:\n   - **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This can be represented as:\n     $$ \n     F = 0 \implies \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = 0 \n     $$\n   - **Second Law**: The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is given by:\n     $$ \n     F = ma \n     $$\n   - **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which can be expressed as:\n     $$ \n     F_{AB} = -F_{BA} \n     $$\n\n2. **Law of Universal Gravitation**: Newton's law of gravitation describes the gravitational force between two masses. It is mathematically expressed as:\n   $$ \n   F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \n   $$\n   where \( F \) is the gravitational force, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses, and \( r \) is the distance between their centers.\n\n3. **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**: This law relates the change in magnetic flux through a circuit to the electromotive force (EMF) induced in the circuit. It can be mathematically stated as:\n   $$ \n   \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \n   $$\n   where \( \mathcal{E} \) is the induced EMF and \( \Phi_B \) is the magnetic flux.\n\n4. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: This principle states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum remains constant. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   L = I\omega \n   $$\n   where \( L \) is angular momentum, \( I \) is the moment of inertia, and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity.\n\n5. **Laws of Thermodynamics**: These laws describe the principles of energy transfer and transformation. For example, the first law of thermodynamics, which is a statement of energy conservation, can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   \Delta U = Q - W \n   $$\n   where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is the heat added to the system, and \( W \) is the work done by the system.\n\n6. **SchrÃ¶dinger's Equation**: In quantum mechanics, this fundamental equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is expressed as:\n   $$ \n   i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \n   $$\n   where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant, \( \Psi \) is the wave function, and \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator.\n\nThese examples illustrate how mathematical language and notation are essential for formulating and understanding the fundamental principles of physics. The relationship between mathematics and physics has been a subject of study since antiquity, and it continues to evolve, influencing both fields significantly.
