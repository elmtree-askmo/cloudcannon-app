    What are the base SI units for length and mass?
answer: >-
    The base SI units for length and mass are as follows:\n\n- **Length:** The base SI unit for length is the meter (m).\n- **Mass:** The base SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg).\n\nThese units are part of the International System of Units (SI), which provides a standardized framework for measurements in science and engineering. The use of these units ensures consistency and clarity in scientific communication and calculations.
