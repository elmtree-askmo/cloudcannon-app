    How does temperature relate to thermal energy?
answer: >-
    Temperature is fundamentally related to thermal energy, which is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules in a substance. As temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles in a material also increases, leading to greater thermal energy.\n\n1. **Direct Proportionality**: The quantity of heat transferred (denoted as $ q_{rev} $) is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $ T $ of an object. This means that as the temperature rises, the amount of heat energy transferred also increases. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   q_{rev} \propto T \n   $$\n\n2. **Thermal Energy and Temperature**: Thermal energy can be quantified using the Boltzmann constant $ k_B $. At a temperature of 293 K (approximately room temperature), the thermal energy can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   \text{Thermal Energy} = k_B T \approx 0.025 \, \text{eV} \, \text{or} \, 0.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}\n   $$\n   This indicates that thermal energy is a measure of the energy due to the random motion of particles, which is directly influenced by temperature.\n\n3. **Molecular Motion**: In different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas), the effect of temperature on thermal energy varies. In solids, particles are fixed in place but vibrate around their equilibrium positions. In liquids, particles can move more freely, and in gases, they have the most freedom of movement. Higher temperatures lead to increased molecular motion, resulting in higher thermal energy.\n\n4. **Entropy and Temperature**: The relationship between thermal energy and temperature also ties into the concept of entropy. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system increases with temperature, as higher temperatures allow for a greater number of microstates (configurations of particles). This is expressed in the equation for change in entropy during an isothermal process:\n   $$\n   \Delta S = \frac{\Delta Q}{T}\n   $$\n   where $ \Delta S $ is the change in entropy, $ \Delta Q $ is the change in heat, and $ T $ is the absolute temperature.\n\nIn summary, temperature is a critical factor in determining the thermal energy of a system. As temperature increases, the thermal energy associated with the random motion of particles also increases, leading to greater heat transfer and changes in entropy.
