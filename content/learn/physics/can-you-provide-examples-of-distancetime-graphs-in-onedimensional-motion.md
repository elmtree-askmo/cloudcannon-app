    Distance-time graphs are essential tools for visualizing the motion of objects in one dimension. They plot distance on the vertical axis (Y-axis) and time on the horizontal axis (X-axis). Here are some examples of distance-time graphs that illustrate different types of motion:\n\n1. **Uniform Motion**: \n   - In this case, an object moves at a constant speed. The distance-time graph will be a straight line with a positive slope. For example, if a car travels at a steady speed of 60 km/h, the graph will show a straight line that rises steadily as time progresses.\n\n2. **Stationary Object**: \n   - When an object is at rest, the distance-time graph will be a horizontal line parallel to the X-axis. This indicates that the distance from the starting point does not change over time. For instance, if a person stands still for 5 minutes, the graph will remain flat during that time.\n\n3. **Accelerating Object**: \n   - If an object is accelerating, the distance-time graph will be a curve that becomes steeper over time. For example, a bus that starts from rest and accelerates to a higher speed will show a curve that rises more steeply as time increases, indicating that the distance covered is increasing at a faster rate.\n\n4. **Decelerating Object**: \n   - Conversely, if an object is decelerating, the graph will also be a curve, but it will flatten out over time. For instance, if a car is moving at a high speed and then begins to slow down, the graph will show a curve that rises less steeply as time progresses.\n\n5. **Changing Speeds**: \n   - A graph can also represent an object that changes speed. For example, if a bus travels at a constant speed for a while, then speeds up, and finally comes to a stop, the graph will consist of a straight line (constant speed), followed by a steeper line (increased speed), and then a horizontal line (stopped).\n\nThese examples illustrate how distance-time graphs can effectively represent various types of motion, providing insights into the speed and behavior of moving objects. Understanding these graphs is crucial for analyzing motion in physics.
