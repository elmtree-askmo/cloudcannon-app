    What are Newton's Laws and how are they mathematically formulated?
answer: >-
    Newton's Laws of Motion are three fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. These laws were first formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in his seminal work, "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," published in 1687. Here is a detailed overview of each law along with their mathematical formulations:\n\n1. **Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)**:\n   - **Statement**: An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at a constant velocity in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: This law can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     \text{If } F_{\text{net}} = 0, \text{ then } v = \text{constant}\n     $$\n   - This implies that if no net force is acting on an object, its velocity remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Newton's Second Law**:\n   - **Statement**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This law quantifies the effect of forces on motion.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: The law is commonly expressed as:\n     $$\n     F = ma\n     $$\n     where $ F $ is the net force applied to the object, $ m $ is the mass of the object, and $ a $ is the acceleration produced.\n   - This can also be expressed in terms of momentum ($ p $):\n     $$\n     F = \frac{dp}{dt}\n     $$\n     where $ p = mv $ is the momentum of the object.\n\n3. **Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)**:\n   - **Statement**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always occur in pairs; if one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the first object.\n   - **Mathematical Formulation**: This can be expressed as:\n     $$\n     F_{A \to B} = -F_{B \to A}\n     $$\n   - Here, $ F_{A \to B} $ is the force exerted by object A on object B, and $ F_{B \to A} $ is the force exerted by object B on object A.\n\nThese laws form the foundation of classical mechanics and have been instrumental in understanding the motion of objects under various forces. They are widely applicable in everyday situations and are essential for the study of physics, although they have limitations at very high speeds (close to the speed of light), in strong gravitational fields, or at quantum scales, where relativistic and quantum mechanics take precedence.
