    How is mass defined in physics?
answer: >-
    In physics, mass is defined as the quantity of matter in an object and is a fundamental property of all matter. It is quantitatively measured as the resistance that a body of matter offers to a change in its speed or position when a force is applied. This property is often referred to as inertia. The greater the mass of an object, the more force is required to change its motion, as described by Newton's Second Law of Motion, which states that force equals mass times acceleration ($F = ma$).\n\nMass is an intrinsic property, meaning it does not change regardless of the object's location or the gravitational field it is in. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). It is important to distinguish mass from weight; while mass measures the amount of matter in an object, weight is the force exerted on that mass by gravity. Weight can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nW = m \cdot g\n$$\n\nwhere $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/sÂ² on Earth).\n\nIn modern physics, the concept of mass has evolved, especially with the advent of particle physics, where different particles can have different masses even if they contain the same amount of matter. This complexity highlights that mass is not solely a measure of the quantity of matter but also relates to the intrinsic properties of particles.\n\nIn summary, mass is a fundamental concept in physics that plays a crucial role in understanding motion, gravity, and the behavior of matter in various physical contexts.
