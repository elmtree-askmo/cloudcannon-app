    What is Bragg's Law and how is it applied in X-ray diffraction?
answer: >-
    Bragg's Law is a fundamental principle in crystallography that describes the relationship between the angle at which X-rays are diffracted by a crystal lattice and the spacing between the lattice planes. Formulated by physicist Sir William Lawrence Bragg and his father, Sir William Henry Bragg, in 1913, the law is expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\nn\lambda = 2d\sin\theta\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ n $ is an integer representing the order of the diffraction,\n- $ \lambda $ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays,\n- $ d $ is the distance between the crystal planes (interplanar spacing),\n- $ \theta $ is the angle of incidence (and reflection) of the X-rays.\n\nBragg's Law explains the conditions for constructive interference of X-rays reflected by the planes of a crystal lattice. When X-rays strike a crystal, they are scattered by the electrons surrounding the atoms. If the path difference between the waves reflected from adjacent planes is an integer multiple of the wavelength, constructive interference occurs, resulting in a detectable intensity of diffracted X-rays.\n\nIn practical applications, Bragg's Law is utilized in X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques to analyze crystal structures. By measuring the angles at which X-rays are diffracted, researchers can determine the interplanar spacing $ d $ and thus infer the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. This method has been pivotal in identifying and characterizing various materials, including minerals, metals, and biological macromolecules.\n\nBragg's Law has significant implications in various fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology, as it provides insights into the structural properties of materials and their interactions.
