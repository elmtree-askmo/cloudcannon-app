    How do resistors behave differently when connected in parallel compared to in series?
answer: >-
    Resistors behave differently when connected in series compared to when they are connected in parallel, primarily in terms of current flow, voltage distribution, and equivalent resistance.\n\n### Resistors in Series\n1. **Current**: In a series configuration, the same current flows through each resistor. This means that the current is constant at all points in the circuit.\n2. **Voltage**: The total voltage across the series of resistors is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops across each resistor. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$ \n   V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \ldots \n   $$\n   where $ V_1, V_2, V_3, \ldots $ are the voltage drops across each resistor.\n3. **Equivalent Resistance**: The total or equivalent resistance $ R_T $ of resistors in series is simply the sum of their resistances:\n   $$\n   R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots \n   $$\n\n### Resistors in Parallel\n1. **Current**: In a parallel configuration, the voltage across each resistor is the same, but the current can vary. The total current flowing from the source is the sum of the currents through each parallel branch:\n   $$\n   I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \ldots \n   $$\n   where $ I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots $ are the currents through each resistor.\n2. **Voltage**: The voltage across each resistor in parallel is equal to the source voltage. Thus, if connected to a voltage source $ V $, then:\n   $$\n   V = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = \ldots \n   $$\n3. **Equivalent Resistance**: The total or equivalent resistance $ R_T $ of resistors in parallel is calculated using the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each individual resistance:\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots \n   $$\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, when resistors are connected in series, they share the same current and the total resistance is the sum of their resistances, while in parallel, they share the same voltage and the total resistance is found using the reciprocal formula. This fundamental difference affects how circuits are designed and analyzed in electrical engineering and physics.
