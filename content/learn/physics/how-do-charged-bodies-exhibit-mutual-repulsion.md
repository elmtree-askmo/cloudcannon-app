    How do charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion?
answer: >-
    Charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion due to the fundamental principles of electrostatics, specifically described by Coulomb's law. According to Coulomb's first law, like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract. This means that when two bodies possess the same type of charge—either both positive or both negative—they will exert a force on each other that pushes them apart.\n\nThe force of repulsion between two charged bodies can be quantified using Coulomb's law, which states that the force $F$ between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is Coulomb's constant, approximately equal to $8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$. This equation indicates that the force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. As the distance $r$ decreases, the force of repulsion increases, leading to a stronger interaction between the charges.\n\nIn summary, charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion due to the nature of electric charge, where like charges repel each other, and this interaction can be mathematically described by Coulomb's law.
