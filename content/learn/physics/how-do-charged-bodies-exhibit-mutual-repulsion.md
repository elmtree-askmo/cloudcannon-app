    How do charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion?
answer: >-
    Charged bodies exhibit mutual repulsion due to the fundamental properties of electric charge. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. According to the principles of electrostatics, like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract. This behavior can be explained through Coulomb's law, which quantifies the electrostatic force between two charged objects.\n\nCoulomb's law states that the force $ F $ between two point charges $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $ separated by a distance $ r $ is given by the formula:\n\n$$\nF = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\n$$\n\nwhere $ k $ is Coulomb's law constant, approximately $ 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $. The force is positive when both charges are of the same type (either both positive or both negative), indicating a repulsive force.\n\nWhen two charged bodies with like charges come close to each other, the electrons and nuclei within each body experience a shift. This shift results in similar charges accumulating near the surfaces of both objects, leading to a repulsive force between them. The greater the magnitude of the charges and the closer the distance between them, the stronger the repulsive force will be.\n\nIn summary, the mutual repulsion of charged bodies is a direct consequence of the nature of electric charges and is mathematically described by Coulomb's law, which illustrates how the force between charges varies with their magnitudes and the distance separating them.
