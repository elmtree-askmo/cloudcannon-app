    What is the definition of reflection in physics?
answer: >-
    In physics, reflection is defined as the change in the direction of a wavefront at the interface between two different media, resulting in the wavefront bouncing back into the original medium. This phenomenon is commonly observed with light waves when they strike a surface, such as a mirror. \n\nThe law of reflection states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, which is the angle at which the incoming wave (incident ray) strikes the surface relative to the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface). This can be summarized as:\n\n$$\n\theta_r = \theta_i\n$$\n\nwhere $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection and $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence. This principle applies not only to light but also to other types of waves, such as sound waves, when they encounter a flat surface.\n\nReflection can be categorized into two main types: specular reflection, which occurs on smooth surfaces and results in clear images, and diffuse reflection, which occurs on rough surfaces and scatters light in many directions. Understanding the principles of reflection is crucial in various applications, including optics, acoustics, and imaging technologies.
