    How does forced harmonic vibration differ from free vibration?
answer: >-
    Forced harmonic vibration and free vibration are two fundamental concepts in the study of mechanical vibrations, each characterized by distinct behaviors and underlying principles.\n\n**Free Vibration** occurs when a mechanical system oscillates without any external forces acting on it after an initial disturbance. The system vibrates at its natural frequency, which is determined by its physical properties such as mass and stiffness. For example, a pendulum swinging after being pushed is an instance of free vibration. The motion continues until energy is dissipated due to damping effects, such as friction or air resistance, leading to a gradual decrease in amplitude over time.\n\nMathematically, the equation of motion (EoM) for free vibrations can be expressed as:\n$$\nm_{e} \ddot{y}_{e} + c_{e} \dot{y}_{e} + k_{e} y_{e} = 0\n$$\nwhere $m_{e}$ is the mass, $c_{e}$ is the damping coefficient, and $k_{e}$ is the stiffness of the system.\n\n**Forced Vibration**, on the other hand, occurs when an external force is applied to the system, causing it to oscillate. This external force can be periodic, such as a sinusoidal force, and it drives the system to vibrate at the frequency of the applied force rather than its natural frequency. An example of forced vibration is a mass-spring system subjected to a periodic driving force.\n\nThe equation of motion for forced vibrations can be represented as:\n$$\nm_{e} \ddot{y}_{e} + c_{e} \dot{y}_{e} + k_{e} y_{e} = F_{0, e} \cos(\omega t)\n$$\nwhere $F_{0, e}$ is the amplitude of the external force and $\omega$ is the frequency of the applied force.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between forced harmonic vibration and free vibration are:\n- **Source of Motion**: Free vibration is due to an initial disturbance with no external forces, while forced vibration is driven by external forces.\n- **Frequency of Oscillation**: Free vibration oscillates at the system's natural frequency, whereas forced vibration oscillates at the frequency of the external force.\n- **Damping Effects**: Free vibrations typically diminish over time due to damping, while forced vibrations can maintain a steady-state amplitude depending on the relationship between the driving frequency and the system's natural frequency.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for engineers when designing systems to ensure stability and performance, particularly in applications such as machinery, structural engineering, and acoustics.
