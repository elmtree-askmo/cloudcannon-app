    How is the displacement current mathematically formulated in Maxwell's equations?
answer: >-
    The displacement current is mathematically formulated in Maxwell's equations as an extension of Ampère's law. It accounts for the changing electric field in situations where there is no actual current flowing, such as in a capacitor. The displacement current density, denoted as $ J_d $, is defined as the rate of change of the electric displacement field $ D $:\n\n$$\nJ_d = \frac{\partial D}{\partial t}\n$$\n\nIn the context of Maxwell's equations, the displacement current is incorporated into the modified form of Ampère's law, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\nabla \times B = \mu_0 \left( J + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \right)\n$$\n\nHere, $ B $ is the magnetic field, $ J $ is the conduction current density, $ \mu_0 $ is the permeability of free space, $ \epsilon_0 $ is the permittivity of free space, and $ E $ is the electric field. The term $ \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} $ represents the displacement current, which allows for the continuity of the magnetic field even in regions where there is no conduction current.\n\nThis formulation shows that the displacement current density has the same units as the conduction current density, and it serves as a source of the magnetic field, similar to actual current. Thus, the displacement current is crucial for understanding electromagnetic wave propagation and the behavior of electric fields in dynamic situations.
