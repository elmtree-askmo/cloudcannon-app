    What is free fall and how does gravity affect it?
answer: >-
    Free fall is a term used in physics to describe the motion of an object that is falling solely under the influence of gravity, without any other forces acting on it, such as air resistance. In classical mechanics, this means that the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force, which causes it to accelerate towards the Earth (or another celestial body) at a constant rate. On Earth, this acceleration due to gravity is approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$.\n\nIn the context of Newtonian physics, free fall can be described by Newton's laws of motion. Specifically, the weight of an object, which is the force due to gravity, can be expressed with the equation:\n\n$$\nW = mg\n$$\n\nwhere $ W $ is the weight, $ m $ is the mass of the object, and $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity. This means that all objects, regardless of their mass, will experience the same acceleration when in free fall, assuming air resistance is negligible.\n\nIn general relativity, free fall is described differently. Here, gravity is not viewed as a force but rather as a curvature of space-time. An object in free fall moves along a geodesic, which is the shortest path between two points in curved space-time. For example, satellites orbiting Earth are in free fall, as they are continuously falling towards the planet but also moving forward, resulting in an orbit.\n\nIt's important to note that for an object to be considered in free fall, it must not encounter air resistance. In a vacuum, where there is no air, all objects will fall at the same rate regardless of their mass. However, in the presence of air, factors such as shape and surface area can affect the rate of fall due to air resistance, which can lead to different falling speeds for different objects.\n\nIn summary, free fall is a fundamental concept in physics that illustrates how gravity influences the motion of objects, and it serves as a basis for understanding more complex gravitational interactions in both classical and modern physics.
