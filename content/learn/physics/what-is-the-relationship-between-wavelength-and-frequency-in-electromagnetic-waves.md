    What is the relationship between wavelength and frequency in electromagnetic waves?
answer: >-
    The relationship between wavelength and frequency in electromagnetic waves is described by the equation:\n\n$$\nf = \frac{c}{\lambda}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ f $ is the frequency of the wave,\n- $ c $ is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately $ 3 \times 10^8 $ m/s),\n- $ \lambda $ (lambda) is the wavelength of the wave.\n\nThis equation indicates that frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. As the wavelength decreases, the frequency increases, and vice versa. This means that electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths (such as X-rays and gamma rays) have higher frequencies and, consequently, higher energy, while those with longer wavelengths (such as radio waves) have lower frequencies and lower energy.\n\nIn summary, the speed of electromagnetic waves is constant, and the relationship between wavelength and frequency can be summarized as follows: if the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases, and if the frequency decreases, the wavelength increases. This fundamental relationship is crucial in various applications, including telecommunications and medical imaging technologies.
