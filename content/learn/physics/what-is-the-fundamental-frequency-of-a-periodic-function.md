    What is the fundamental frequency of a periodic function?
answer: >-
    The fundamental frequency of a periodic function, often denoted as $ f_0 $, is defined as the lowest frequency of that function. It is calculated as the inverse of the fundamental period $ T_0 $, which is the shortest period over which the function repeats itself. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nf_0 = \frac{1}{T_0}\n$$\n\nIn the context of Fourier series, the fundamental frequency is significant because it serves as the base frequency from which all other frequencies (harmonics) in the series are derived. Each harmonic has a frequency that is an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is $ f_0 $, the first harmonic would be $ 2f_0 $, the second harmonic $ 3f_0 $, and so on.\n\nThe fundamental frequency is also related to the concept of harmonics in music, where it represents the pitch of the note perceived as the lowest partial present in a sound. In summary, the fundamental frequency is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of periodic functions and their representation through Fourier series.
