    What are the key differences between free and forced vibrations?
answer: >-
    The key differences between free and forced vibrations can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Free Vibration**: This occurs when a system is set into motion by an initial disturbance and then allowed to vibrate without any external forces acting on it, except for the restoring force. The system oscillates at its natural frequency.\n   - **Forced Vibration**: This occurs when an external periodic force is applied to a system, causing it to vibrate. The system attempts to maintain its vibrations in response to this external force.\n\n2. **Forces Involved**:\n   - **Free Vibration**: The only force acting on the system is the restoring force, which is dependent on the system's properties (like stiffness).\n   - **Forced Vibration**: An external periodic force is continuously applied, which drives the system's motion.\n\n3. **Frequency**:\n   - **Free Vibration**: The frequency of free vibrations is determined by the physical properties of the system, such as its density, shape, and elasticity. It oscillates at its natural frequency.\n   - **Forced Vibration**: The frequency of forced vibrations is dictated by the frequency of the external force applied to the system. The system can vibrate at this frequency, regardless of its natural frequency.\n\n4. **Duration of Motion**:\n   - **Free Vibration**: The motion continues until the energy is dissipated (e.g., through damping), and the system eventually comes to rest.\n   - **Forced Vibration**: The motion persists as long as the external force is applied. If the external force is removed, the forced vibrations cease.\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   - **Free Vibration**: A pendulum swinging after being pushed, or a tuning fork vibrating after being struck.\n   - **Forced Vibration**: A mass-spring system subjected to a periodic driving force, such as a car's suspension system responding to road bumps.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for analyzing and designing mechanical systems, as they influence the dynamic behavior and stability of structures and machines.
