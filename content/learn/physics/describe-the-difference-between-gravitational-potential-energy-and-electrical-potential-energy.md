    Describe the difference between gravitational potential energy and electrical potential energy.
answer: >-
    Gravitational potential energy (GPE) and electrical potential energy (EPE) are both forms of potential energy, but they arise from different physical interactions and are calculated using different principles.\n\n### Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)\nGravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. The higher an object is above a reference point (usually the ground), the more gravitational potential energy it has. The formula to calculate gravitational potential energy is:\n\n$$\nGPE = mgh\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ m $ is the mass of the object (in kilograms),\n- $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $ 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 $ on Earth),\n- $ h $ is the height of the object above the reference point (in meters).\n\nFor example, a book placed on a high shelf has more gravitational potential energy than one on a lower shelf because it has a greater height from which it can fall.\n\n### Electrical Potential Energy (EPE)\nElectrical potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy a charged particle possesses due to its position in an electric field. It is related to the work done in moving a charge within that field. The formula for electrical potential energy is given by:\n\n$$\nEPE = qV\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ q $ is the charge (in coulombs),\n- $ V $ is the electric potential (in volts).\n\nElectric potential is defined as the potential energy per unit charge, and it reflects the work done to move a charge from one point to another in an electric field. For instance, a battery stores electrical potential energy due to the separation of positive and negative charges.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Source of Energy**:\n   - GPE is due to gravitational forces acting on mass.\n   - EPE is due to electric forces acting on charged particles.\n\n2. **Calculation**:\n   - GPE depends on mass, gravitational acceleration, and height.\n   - EPE depends on charge and electric potential.\n\n3. **Units**:\n   - Both forms of potential energy are measured in joules (J).\n\n4. **Physical Context**:\n   - GPE is commonly observed in scenarios involving heights, such as objects falling or being lifted.\n   - EPE is observed in electrical circuits and systems involving charged particles.\n\nIn summary, while both gravitational potential energy and electrical potential energy are forms of stored energy related to position, they arise from different forces and are calculated using different parameters.
