answer: >-
    To calculate the vector sum of electric fields from multiple charges, we utilize the principle of superposition. This principle states that the total electric field at a specific point in space is the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each individual charge. Here’s a step-by-step process to perform this calculation:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Charges and Their Positions\nDetermine the positions and magnitudes of all the point charges involved in the scenario. For example, let’s say we have three point charges $ Q_1, Q_2, $ and $ Q_3 $ located at positions $ \vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2, $ and $ \vec{r}_3 $ respectively.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Electric Field from Each Charge\nFor each charge, calculate the electric field $ \vec{E}_i $ at the point of interest using Coulomb's law:\n\n$$\n\vec{E}_i = k \frac{Q_i}{r_i^2} \hat{r}_i\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant,\n- $ Q_i $ is the magnitude of the charge,\n- $ r_i $ is the distance from the charge to the point of interest,\n- $ \hat{r}_i $ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point of interest.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Direction of Each Electric Field\nThe direction of the electric field depends on the sign of the charge:\n- For a **positive charge**, the electric field points **away** from the charge.\n- For a **negative charge**, the electric field points **towards** the charge.\n\n### Step 4: Vector Addition of Electric Fields\nOnce you have calculated the electric fields from all charges, you can find the total electric field $ \vec{E}_{\text{total}} $ at the point by summing the individual electric fields vectorially:\n\n$$\n\vec{E}_{\text{total}} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 + \vec{E}_3 + \ldots + \vec{E}_n\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Consider Components\nSince electric fields are vector quantities, it is often useful to break them down into their components (e.g., x and y components) before summing them. For example, if $ \vec{E}_i $ has components $ E_{ix} $ and $ E_{iy} $, the total electric field components can be calculated as:\n\n$$\nE_{\text{total}, x} = E_{1x} + E_{2x} + E_{3x} + \ldots + E_{nx}\n$$\n\n$$\nE_{\text{total}, y} = E_{1y} + E_{2y} + E_{3y} + \ldots + E_{ny}\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Resultant Electric Field\nFinally, the magnitude and direction of the resultant electric field can be determined from the total components:\n\n$$\n|\vec{E}_{\text{total}}| = \sqrt{(E_{\text{total}, x})^2 + (E_{\text{total}, y})^2}\n$$\n\nThe direction can be found using the arctangent function:\n\n$$\n\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{E_{\text{total}, y}}{E_{\text{total}, x}}\right)\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps, you can effectively calculate the vector sum of electric fields from multiple charges, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the electric field at a given point in space. This method is essential for analyzing complex charge configurations and understanding the interactions between charges in electrostatics.
