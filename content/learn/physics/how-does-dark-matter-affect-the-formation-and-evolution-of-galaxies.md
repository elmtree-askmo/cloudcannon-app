    How does dark matter affect the formation and evolution of galaxies?
answer: >-
    Dark matter plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, influencing their structure, stability, and distribution throughout the universe. Here are some key points regarding the impact of dark matter on galaxies:\n\n1. **Galactic Halos**: Dark matter primarily exists in the form of halos surrounding galaxies. These halos are essential for the formation and stability of galaxies, providing the necessary gravitational pull to hold visible matter together. Without these substantial dark matter halos, galaxies would not have the mass required to form and evolve as we observe them today.\n\n2. **Gravitational Effects**: The gravitational influence of dark matter affects how galaxies form, grow, and cluster together. Observations, such as those from the Rubin Observatory, demonstrate that dark matter's properties significantly impact the evolution of the universe, including the clumping of galaxies into larger structures known as the cosmic web.\n\n3. **N-body Simulations**: Research utilizing N-body simulations has shown that dark matter's characteristics, particularly in cold dark matter (CDM) models, are critical for understanding galaxy formation. These simulations help scientists explore how dark matter interacts with baryonic (normal) matter, influencing star formation rates, angular momentum, and the overall morphology of galaxies.\n\n4. **Cosmic Dawn**: During the cosmic dawn, when the first stars and galaxies began to form, dark matter's gravitational effects were pivotal. Studies of this era reveal how dark matter contributed to the early structure of the universe, shaping the formation of the first galaxies and their subsequent evolution.\n\n5. **Observational Evidence**: Techniques such as gravitational lensing and X-ray emissions from hot intracluster gas provide observational evidence of dark matter's presence and its influence on galaxy clusters. These observations confirm that dark matter constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe, significantly affecting the properties of galaxies, including their stellar populations and the distribution of matter within them.\n\n6. **Impact on Stellar Properties**: The mass of dark matter halos influences various properties of stars within galaxies, such as their ages, metal content, and formation rates. Research indicates that these stellar properties are not solely dependent on the visible matter but are also significantly affected by the total mass, including the dark matter component.\n\nIn summary, dark matter is integral to the formation and evolution of galaxies, shaping their structure and influencing their dynamics through gravitational interactions. Understanding dark matter is essential for a comprehensive view of cosmic evolution and the large-scale structure of the universe.
