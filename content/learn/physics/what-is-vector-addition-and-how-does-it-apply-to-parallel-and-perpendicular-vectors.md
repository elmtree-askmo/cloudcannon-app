    What is vector addition, and how does it apply to parallel and perpendicular vectors?
answer: >-
    Vector addition is the mathematical process of combining two or more vectors to produce a resultant vector, which represents the total effect of the original vectors. This operation is fundamental in understanding how vectors interact and is widely used in various fields, including physics and engineering.\n\n### Definition and Properties\nVector addition adheres to specific rules and properties, such as commutativity (i.e., $\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}$) and associativity (i.e., $(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) + \vec{C} = \vec{A} + (\vec{B} + \vec{C})$). These properties facilitate the study of vector spaces and their subspaces.\n\n### Methods of Vector Addition\n1. **Graphical Methods**: \n   - **Head-to-Tail Method**: Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector. The resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.\n   - **Parallelogram Law**: If two vectors are represented as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of the parallelogram represents the resultant vector.\n\n2. **Component-wise Addition**: Vectors can also be added by breaking them down into their components along the coordinate axes. For vectors $\vec{A} = (A_x, A_y)$ and $\vec{B} = (B_x, B_y)$, the resultant vector $\vec{R}$ can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   \vec{R} = (A_x + B_x, A_y + B_y)\n   $$\n\n### Parallel and Perpendicular Vectors\n- **Parallel Vectors**: When vectors are parallel (either in the same direction or opposite), their magnitudes can be added or subtracted directly. For example, if $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are parallel and in the same direction, the resultant vector $\vec{R}$ is given by:\n  $$\n  \vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}\n  $$\n  If they are in opposite directions, the resultant is:\n  $$\n  \vec{R} = |\vec{A}| - |\vec{B}|\n  $$\n\n- **Perpendicular Vectors**: When vectors are perpendicular to each other, the Pythagorean theorem is used to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. If $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ are perpendicular, the magnitude of the resultant vector $\vec{R}$ is given by:\n  $$\n  R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\n  $$\n  The direction can be determined using trigonometric functions, such as:\n  $$\n  \tan(\theta) = \frac{B}{A}\n  $$\n\n### Applications\nVector addition is crucial in physics for resolving forces into their components, determining net forces acting on objects, and analyzing motion. Understanding how to add vectors, both graphically and analytically, is essential for solving problems related to forces, motion, and other vector-related phenomena.\n\nIn summary, vector addition is a foundational concept in physics and mathematics, enabling the analysis of various physical situations involving direction and magnitude.
