    How is thermal velocity defined and calculated in the context of quantum mechanics?
answer: >-
    In the context of quantum mechanics, thermal velocity is defined as the average velocity of particles in a system that arises from their thermal energy. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of gases and plasmas, especially in fields like fusion research.\n\nThe thermal velocity ($v_{th}$) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nv_{th} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (approximately $1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}$),\n- $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,\n- $m$ is the mass of the particle.\n\nThis formula indicates that the thermal velocity increases with temperature and decreases with the mass of the particle. For instance, lighter particles will have higher thermal velocities at a given temperature compared to heavier particles.\n\nUnderstanding thermal velocity is essential in quantum mechanics as it relates to phenomena such as quantum tunneling, where particles can pass through potential barriers due to their thermal energy, even if they do not have enough classical energy to overcome the barrier. This is particularly relevant in fusion reactions, where the thermal velocities of particles must be sufficient to allow for the conditions necessary for fusion to occur.
