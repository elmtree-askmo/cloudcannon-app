    How is heat calculated for a temperature change in a substance?
answer: >-
    To calculate the heat transfer associated with a temperature change in a substance, you can use the specific heat formula. The formula is expressed as:\n\n$$\nQ = mc\Delta T\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $Q$ is the heat transferred (in joules),\n- $m$ is the mass of the substance (in grams or kilograms),\n- $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the substance (in joules per gram per degree Celsius, J/g°C or joules per kilogram per Kelvin, J/kg·K),\n- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius or Kelvin), calculated as $T_f - T_i$, where $T_f$ is the final temperature and $T_i$ is the initial temperature.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Heat Transfer:\n1. **Identify the Mass**: Determine the mass of the substance you are working with.\n2. **Determine Initial and Final Temperatures**: Measure or note the initial and final temperatures of the substance to find the temperature change.\n3. **Calculate the Change in Temperature**: Use the formula $\Delta T = T_f - T_i$.\n4. **Find the Specific Heat Capacity**: Look up or measure the specific heat capacity of the substance.\n5. **Plug Values into the Formula**: Substitute the values of $m$, $c$, and $\Delta T$ into the formula to calculate $Q$.\n\n### Example Calculation:\nIf you have 100 grams of water (specific heat capacity $c = 4.18 \, \text{J/g°C}$) that is heated from 20°C to 80°C, the calculation would be:\n\n1. Mass $m = 100 \, \text{g}$\n2. Initial temperature $T_i = 20°C$\n3. Final temperature $T_f = 80°C$\n4. Change in temperature $\Delta T = 80°C - 20°C = 60°C$\n5. Specific heat capacity $c = 4.18 \, \text{J/g°C}$\n\nNow, substituting these values into the formula:\n\n$$\nQ = (100 \, \text{g}) \times (4.18 \, \text{J/g°C}) \times (60°C) = 25080 \, \text{J}\n$$\n\nThus, the heat transferred to the water is 25080 joules.\n\nThis method can be applied to any substance, provided you know its specific heat capacity and the mass involved.
