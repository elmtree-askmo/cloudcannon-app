    How is electric current defined and measured?
answer: >-
    Electric current is defined as the flow of electric charge, which can be carried by charged particles such as electrons, protons, ions, or holes. In most practical applications, particularly in electrical circuits, the charge carriers are electrons moving through a conductor, such as a wire. The current is a measure of the quantity of charge passing a specific point in the circuit per unit of time.\n\nThe average electric current ($I$) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nI = \frac{Q}{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the electric charge in coulombs and $t$ is the time in seconds. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is defined as one coulomb of charge passing through a point in a circuit per second.\n\nTo measure electric current, an instrument called an ammeter is used. The ammeter must be connected in series with the circuit component whose current is to be measured, ensuring that the current flows through the ammeter. There are various types of ammeters, including digital multimeters (DMMs) and dâ€™Arsonval meters, which can measure both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). For larger currents, a precision resistor known as a shunt can be used in parallel with the ammeter to allow for accurate measurement without exceeding the ammeter's voltage range.\n\nIn summary, electric current is a fundamental concept in electricity, representing the flow of charge, and it is measured in amperes using devices like ammeters.
