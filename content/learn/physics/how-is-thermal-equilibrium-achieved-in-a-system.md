    How is thermal equilibrium achieved in a system?
answer: >-
    Thermal equilibrium is achieved in a system when two or more bodies in physical contact with each other exchange no heat energy, resulting in them having the same temperature. This condition can be defined as follows:\n\n1. **Definition**: Thermal equilibrium occurs when there is no net flow of thermal energy between two bodies. If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This relationship is a consequence of the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\n2. **Process**: When two bodies at different temperatures come into contact, heat will flow from the hotter body to the cooler one until they reach the same temperature. For example, when molten rock from a volcano cools down, it will release heat to the surrounding atmosphere until both the rock and the air are at the same temperature, achieving thermal equilibrium.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing Thermal Equilibrium**: The rate at which thermal equilibrium is reached can be influenced by several factors, including the initial temperature difference between the bodies. A greater temperature difference typically results in a faster heat exchange process. For instance, pouring boiling water into a glass at room temperature will lead to a quicker approach to thermal equilibrium compared to pouring warm water.\n\n4. **Measurement**: A practical indication of thermal equilibrium is when a thermometer, placed in contact with a substance, stops changing its reading. This indicates that the thermometer and the substance have reached the same temperature, confirming thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, thermal equilibrium is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that describes the state of a system where all parts are at the same temperature, and there is no heat transfer occurring between them.
