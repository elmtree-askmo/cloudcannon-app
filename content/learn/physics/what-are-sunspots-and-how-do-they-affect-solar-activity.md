    What are sunspots and how do they affect solar activity?
answer: >-
    Sunspots are dark, cooler regions on the Sun's surface that are associated with strong magnetic fields. These areas appear dark because the intense magnetic activity prevents some of the heat from the Sun's interior from reaching the surface, resulting in lower temperatures compared to the surrounding areas. Sunspots typically come in groups, with each group containing pairs of spots that exhibit opposite magnetic polaritiesâ€”one set with a positive (north) magnetic field and the other with a negative (south) magnetic field.\n\nThe formation and number of sunspots vary with the solar cycle, which lasts approximately 11 years. During the solar cycle, the Sun transitions from a solar minimum, characterized by few or no sunspots, to a solar maximum, where the number of sunspots increases dramatically. This cyclical nature of sunspot activity is closely monitored by scientists, as it serves as an indicator of the Sun's overall activity level.\n\nSunspots are significant because they are often the sites of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are explosive events that release large amounts of energy and charged particles into space. These solar phenomena can have various effects on space weather, including disruptions to Earth's magnetic field, which can lead to auroras and other atmospheric phenomena. Additionally, changes in solar activity can influence satellite operations, communication systems, and even power grids on Earth.\n\nIn summary, sunspots are crucial markers of solar activity, and their study helps scientists understand the Sun's behavior and its impact on the solar system, including Earth.
