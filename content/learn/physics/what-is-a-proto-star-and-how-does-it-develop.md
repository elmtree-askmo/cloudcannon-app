    What is a proto star and how does it develop?
answer: >-
    A protostar is an early stage in the formation of a star, representing the initial phase of stellar evolution. It forms when a dense region within a molecular cloud collapses under its own gravity, leading to the accumulation of gas and dust. This process typically begins with the fragmentation of a molecular cloud, which is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, into smaller, dense clumps. As these clumps collapse, they generate heat due to gravitational forces, resulting in the formation of a protostar.\n\nThe protostar stage can last anywhere from about 100,000 years to several million years, depending on the mass of the star being formed. For low-mass stars, such as those similar to the Sun, this phase lasts approximately 500,000 years. During this time, the protostar continues to gather mass from its surrounding molecular cloud, and its core temperature gradually increases.\n\nAs the protostar evolves, it eventually reaches temperatures high enough to initiate nuclear fusion, which marks the transition to the next stage of stellar evolution. This fusion process converts hydrogen into helium and releases energy in the form of light and heat, causing the protostar to shine brightly. At this point, the protostar may evolve into a T Tauri star, which is still in the early stages of stellar development but has begun nuclear fusion.\n\nIn summary, a protostar is a crucial phase in the life cycle of a star, characterized by the accumulation of mass and the gradual increase in core temperature, leading to the eventual onset of nuclear fusion and the birth of a new star.
