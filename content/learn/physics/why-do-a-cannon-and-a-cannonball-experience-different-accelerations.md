    Why do a cannon and a cannonball experience different accelerations?
answer: >-
    The reason a cannon and a cannonball experience different accelerations when the cannon is fired is primarily due to their differing masses. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship can be expressed with the formula:\n\n$$\na = \frac{F}{m}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ a $ is the acceleration,\n- $ F $ is the force applied,\n- $ m $ is the mass of the object.\n\nWhen the cannon fires the cannonball, both the cannon and the cannonball experience equal and opposite forces due to Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, because the cannonball has a much smaller mass compared to the cannon, it experiences a much greater acceleration.\n\nFor example, if we consider a cannon with a mass of 600 kg and a cannonball with a mass of 1.5 kg, the force exerted by the cannon on the cannonball is significant enough to propel it forward at a high velocity. The cannonball accelerates rapidly due to its smaller mass, while the cannon recoils in the opposite direction but with much less acceleration because of its larger mass.\n\nIn summary, the different accelerations of the cannon and cannonball can be attributed to the fact that the same force results in a greater acceleration for the lighter object (the cannonball) compared to the heavier object (the cannon), as described by Newton's Second Law.
