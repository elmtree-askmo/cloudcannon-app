    What is the primary cause of ocean acidification?
answer: >-
    The primary cause of ocean acidification is the increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels. As CO2 levels rise in the atmosphere, approximately 30% of this CO2 is absorbed by the oceans. This absorption leads to a series of chemical reactions that form carbonic acid, which subsequently releases hydrogen ions into the seawater, lowering the pH and increasing the acidity of the ocean.\n\nThe process can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **CO2 Emission**: Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.\n2. **CO2 Absorption**: Oceans absorb a substantial portion of this atmospheric CO2.\n3. **Formation of Carbonic Acid**: The absorbed CO2 reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid (H2CO3).\n4. **Release of Hydrogen Ions**: Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions, increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water and lowering the pH.\n\nThis decrease in pH disrupts the marine carbonate system, which is crucial for organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons, such as marine terrapods. As the ocean becomes more acidic, it becomes increasingly challenging for these organisms to form and maintain their calcium carbonate structures, which can have cascading effects on marine ecosystems and food webs.\n\nIn summary, the primary cause of ocean acidification is the rising levels of atmospheric CO2 due to human activities, leading to increased absorption of CO2 by the oceans and subsequent chemical changes that lower ocean pH.
