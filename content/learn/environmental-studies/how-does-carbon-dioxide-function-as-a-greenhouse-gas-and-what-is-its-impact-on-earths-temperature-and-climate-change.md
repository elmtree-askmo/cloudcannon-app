    How does carbon dioxide function as a greenhouse gas, and what is its impact on Earth's temperature and climate change?
answer: >-
    Carbon dioxide (CO₂) functions as a greenhouse gas by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which is a critical factor in regulating the planet's temperature and influencing climate change. Here’s a detailed explanation of its role and impact:\n\n### Mechanism of Greenhouse Effect\n1. **Absorption of Infrared Radiation**: CO₂, along with other greenhouse gases, absorbs infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. When sunlight reaches the Earth, it is converted into heat (infrared radiation). Greenhouse gases like CO₂ trap some of this heat, preventing it from escaping back into space.\n\n2. **Re-radiation of Heat**: After absorbing infrared radiation, CO₂ re-emits some of this energy back towards the Earth's surface, which contributes to warming the atmosphere. This process is essential for maintaining a temperature that supports life on Earth.\n\n### Impact on Earth's Temperature\n- **Global Warming**: The increase in atmospheric CO₂ levels, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, enhances the greenhouse effect. This leads to a rise in global temperatures, commonly referred to as global warming.\n- **Temperature Increase**: The rise in CO₂ concentrations correlates with an increase in average global temperatures. For instance, since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO₂ levels have risen significantly, contributing to an increase in Earth's average temperature by approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius (as of 2021).\n\n### Contribution to Climate Change\n- **Extreme Weather Events**: The warming of the planet due to increased CO₂ levels is linked to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall.\n- **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels**: Higher temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels, which can result in coastal flooding and loss of habitat.\n- **Ecosystem Disruption**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect ecosystems, leading to shifts in species distributions, altered growing seasons, and increased stress on biodiversity.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas that plays a crucial role in the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change. Its increasing concentration in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities, poses serious challenges to the environment and necessitates urgent action to mitigate its impacts through strategies such as carbon sequestration, renewable energy adoption, and reducing carbon footprints.
