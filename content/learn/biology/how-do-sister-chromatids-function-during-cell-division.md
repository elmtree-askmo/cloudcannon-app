    How do sister chromatids function during cell division?
answer: >-
    Sister chromatids play a crucial role during cell division, specifically in the processes of mitosis and meiosis. Hereâ€™s how they function:\n\n1. **Formation**: Sister chromatids are formed during the S phase of the cell cycle when DNA replication occurs. Each chromosome is duplicated, resulting in two identical copies, which are held together at a region called the centromere.\n\n2. **Mitosis**: \n   - During mitosis, sister chromatids are separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes. \n   - The process can be broken down into several stages:\n     - **Prophase**: The chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the mitotic spindle begins to form.\n     - **Metaphase**: Sister chromatids align at the metaphase plate.\n     - **Anaphase**: The centromeres split, and the spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart toward opposite poles of the cell.\n     - **Telophase**: The chromatids reach the poles, and the nuclear envelope begins to reform around each set of chromosomes, followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, resulting in two identical daughter cells.\n\n3. **Meiosis**: \n   - In meiosis, sister chromatids are also separated, but this occurs in two distinct stages (Meiosis I and Meiosis II).\n   - **Meiosis I**: Homologous chromosomes are separated, and sister chromatids remain together.\n   - **Meiosis II**: This is similar to mitosis, where sister chromatids are separated:\n     - **Prophase II**: The spindle apparatus forms again.\n     - **Metaphase II**: Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate.\n     - **Anaphase II**: Sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles.\n     - **Telophase II**: Four haploid cells are formed, each containing one copy of each chromosome.\n\n4. **Significance**: The separation of sister chromatids is essential for maintaining genetic stability. It ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the genetic material, which is critical for proper cell function and organismal development.\n\nIn summary, sister chromatids are vital for the accurate distribution of genetic material during cell division, whether in somatic cells through mitosis or in gametes through meiosis. Their proper separation is crucial for genetic stability and diversity.
