    Describe osmosis and differentiate between isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions.
answer: >-
    Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. This movement occurs in response to differences in osmolarity, which is the total solute concentration of a solution. Osmosis is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is influenced by the tonicity of the surrounding solutions.\n\n### Tonicity and Its Types\n\nTonicity refers to the relative concentration of solutes in a solution compared to another solution, typically in relation to a cell. There are three primary types of tonicity:\n\n1. **Isotonic Solutions**:\n   - An isotonic solution has an equal solute concentration compared to the cytosol (the fluid inside the cell).\n   - In this scenario, there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell, meaning that water enters and exits at the same rate.\n   - This equilibrium helps maintain cell shape and function without causing swelling or shrinking.\n\n2. **Hypertonic Solutions**:\n   - A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration compared to the cytosol.\n   - In this case, water moves out of the cell to the area of higher solute concentration, leading to cell shrinkage or crenation.\n   - This can be detrimental to cells, as excessive water loss can disrupt cellular functions.\n\n3. **Hypotonic Solutions**:\n   - A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration compared to the cytosol.\n   - Here, water moves into the cell, causing it to swell and potentially burst (lyse) if the influx of water is excessive.\n   - This is particularly relevant for cells that lack a rigid cell wall, such as animal cells.\n\n### Biological Examples of Osmosis\n\n- **Plant Cells**: When placed in a hypotonic solution, plant cells absorb water, leading to increased turgor pressure, which helps maintain their structure. Conversely, in a hypertonic solution, plant cells lose water, resulting in wilting.\n- **Freshwater Protists**: Organisms like paramecia use contractile vacuoles to expel excess water that enters their cells due to the hypotonic environment they inhabit.\n- **Marine Invertebrates**: These organisms often have internal salt concentrations that match their environment, allowing them to maintain osmotic balance without significant water loss or gain.\n\nIn summary, osmosis is a vital process that regulates water movement in cells, influenced by the tonicity of the surrounding solutions. Understanding these concepts is essential for comprehending how cells interact with their environment and maintain homeostasis.
