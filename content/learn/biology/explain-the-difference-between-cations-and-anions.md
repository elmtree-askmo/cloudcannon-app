    Explain the difference between cations and anions.
answer: >-
    Cations and anions are both types of ions, which are atoms or groups of atoms that carry an electrical charge due to the loss or gain of electrons. The primary difference between them lies in their electrical charge:\n\n1. **Cations**:\n   - **Charge**: Cations have a positive charge. This occurs when an atom loses one or more electrons, resulting in a surplus of protons compared to electrons.\n   - **Formation**: Typically, cations are formed from metals. For example, sodium (Na) can lose one electron to form a sodium cation (Na⁺).\n   - **Reactivity**: Cations are generally more reactive than anions because they have a greater attraction to electrons, which can lead to the formation of ionic bonds with anions.\n\n2. **Anions**:\n   - **Charge**: Anions have a negative charge. This occurs when an atom gains one or more electrons, resulting in a surplus of electrons compared to protons.\n   - **Formation**: Anions are usually formed from nonmetals. For example, chlorine (Cl) can gain one electron to form a chloride anion (Cl⁻).\n   - **Stability**: Anions gain electrons to attain stability, often achieving a full valence shell, which is a more stable electronic configuration.\n\nIn summary, the key distinctions are:\n- **Charge**: Cations are positively charged, while anions are negatively charged.\n- **Formation**: Cations are typically formed from metals losing electrons, whereas anions are formed from nonmetals gaining electrons.\n\nBoth cations and anions play crucial roles in ionic bonding, where oppositely charged ions attract each other to form stable compounds, often resulting in the formation of crystalline structures.
