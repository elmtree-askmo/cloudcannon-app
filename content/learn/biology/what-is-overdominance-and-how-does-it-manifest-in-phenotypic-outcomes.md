    What is overdominance and how does it manifest in phenotypic outcomes?
answer: >-
    Overdominance, also known as heterozygote advantage, is a genetic phenomenon where the heterozygous genotype (having two different alleles for a gene) exhibits greater fitness than either of the homozygous genotypes (having two identical alleles). This increased fitness can lead to a higher frequency of the heterozygous genotype within a population, as individuals with this genotype are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nA classic example of overdominance is observed in the context of sickle cell disease and malaria resistance. Individuals with one normal hemoglobin allele (A) and one sickle cell allele (S) (genotype AS) have a survival advantage against malaria compared to those with the homozygous genotypes (AA or SS). Specifically:\n\n- **Genotype AA**: Individuals with two normal alleles are susceptible to malaria.\n- **Genotype SS**: Individuals with two sickle cell alleles typically suffer from sickle cell disease, which can lead to severe health complications and reduced lifespan.\n- **Genotype AS**: Heterozygous individuals (AS) have some sickle-shaped cells, which can provide a protective effect against malaria without the severe health issues associated with the homozygous SS genotype.\n\nThis phenomenon illustrates how overdominance can manifest in phenotypic outcomes, as the heterozygous individuals not only survive better in malaria-endemic regions but also contribute to the genetic diversity of the population. Consequently, overdominance can play a significant role in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of populations, particularly in environments where specific diseases exert selective pressure.
