    What are the major classes of biological macromolecules and their elemental composition?
answer: >-
    The major classes of biological macromolecules and their elemental compositions are as follows:\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**:\n   - **Elemental Composition**: Primarily composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) in a typical ratio of 1:2:1 (e.g., glucose has the formula C₆H₁₂O₆).\n   - **Function**: Carbohydrates serve as a primary energy source and provide structural support in cells (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls).\n\n2. **Lipids**:\n   - **Elemental Composition**: Composed mainly of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), but with a much lower proportion of oxygen compared to carbohydrates. Some lipids, like phospholipids, also contain phosphorus (P).\n   - **Function**: Lipids are essential for energy storage, forming cell membranes (phospholipids), and serving as signaling molecules (steroids).\n\n3. **Proteins**:\n   - **Elemental Composition**: Composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). Some proteins may also contain sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P).\n   - **Function**: Proteins perform a wide range of functions, including catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes), providing structural support, and facilitating communication within and between cells.\n\n4. **Nucleic Acids**:\n   - **Elemental Composition**: Composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Nucleotides, the building blocks of nucleic acids, contain a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n   - **Function**: Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information, guiding protein synthesis, and regulating cellular activities.\n\nThese macromolecules are vital for the structure and function of living organisms, each playing unique roles in biological processes. The diversity in their elemental composition contributes to their varied structures and functions, which are essential for life.
