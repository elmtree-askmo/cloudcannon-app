    What are the main classes of biological macromolecules?
answer: >-
    The main classes of biological macromolecules are:\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**: \n   - **Building Blocks**: Monosaccharides (simple sugars) such as glucose and fructose.\n   - **Structure**: Composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1. They can be classified into:\n     - **Monosaccharides**: Single sugar units (e.g., glucose).\n     - **Disaccharides**: Composed of two monosaccharides linked by a glycosidic bond (e.g., sucrose).\n     - **Polysaccharides**: Long chains of monosaccharides (e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose).\n\n2. **Proteins**: \n   - **Building Blocks**: Amino acids.\n   - **Structure**: Proteins are polymers formed by linking amino acids through peptide bonds. The sequence and chemical properties of the amino acids determine the protein's structure and function. Proteins play critical roles in catalysis (enzymes), structure (collagen), transport (hemoglobin), and signaling (hormones).\n\n3. **Nucleic Acids**: \n   - **Building Blocks**: Nucleotides.\n   - **Structure**: Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are polymers made of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are essential for storing and transmitting genetic information.\n\n4. **Lipids**: \n   - **Building Blocks**: Fatty acids and glycerol.\n   - **Structure**: Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules, including triglycerides (fats and oils), phospholipids (major components of cell membranes), and steroids (such as cholesterol). They are primarily involved in energy storage, membrane structure, and signaling.\n\nThese macromolecules are vital for the structure and function of living organisms, each serving distinct roles that contribute to the complexity of biological systems.
