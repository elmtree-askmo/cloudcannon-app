answer: >-
    Capillary action is the ability of water to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces. This phenomenon is primarily driven by two key properties of water: adhesion and cohesion.\n\n1. **Adhesion**: This is the tendency of water molecules to stick to other substances. In the context of capillary action, when water comes into contact with the walls of a narrow tube or a porous material (like a paper towel), the water molecules adhere to the surface due to attractive forces. For example, in a paper towel, water molecules stick to the cellulose fibers, which facilitates the upward movement of water.\n\n2. **Cohesion**: This refers to the attraction between water molecules themselves. Water molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds, which create a cohesive force that allows them to stick to each other. This cohesion is crucial in maintaining a continuous column of water as it moves upward through narrow spaces.\n\nThe interplay between adhesion and cohesion is what enables capillary action. As water adheres to the walls of a vessel, it pulls other water molecules along with it due to cohesion. This is particularly important in biological systems, such as in plants, where capillary action helps transport water from the roots to the leaves.\n\nIn summary, capillary action is a result of the combined effects of adhesion (water sticking to surfaces) and cohesion (water sticking to itself), allowing water to move through narrow spaces effectively. This phenomenon is vital for various natural processes, including the movement of water in plants and the behavior of water in small tubes or porous materials.
