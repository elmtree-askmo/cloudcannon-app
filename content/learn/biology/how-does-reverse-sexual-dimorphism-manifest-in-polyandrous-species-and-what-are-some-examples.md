answer: >-
    Reverse sexual dimorphism in polyandrous species manifests as a situation where females are larger, more colorful, or otherwise more ornamented than males, which is contrary to the typical pattern observed in many species where males exhibit these traits to attract females. This phenomenon is often associated with a reversal of traditional sex roles, where females compete for mates and males take on the majority of parental care responsibilities.\n\n### Examples of Reverse Sexual Dimorphism in Polyandrous Species:\n\n1. **Pheasant-tailed Jacanas (Hydrophasianus chirurgus)**: This bird species is a classic example of polyandry combined with sexual dimorphism reversal. In this species, females are larger and more colorful than males. The females compete for access to multiple males, who are responsible for incubating eggs and caring for the young.\n\n2. **Syngnathidae Family (Seahorses and Pipefish)**: In this family, males are known for their role in parental care, as they carry developing embryos. In many species, females develop pronounced secondary sexual characteristics, such as larger size and more vibrant coloration, which are typically associated with male traits in other species. This reversal of roles is a clear example of how polyandry can lead to sexual dimorphism reversal.\n\n3. **Jacana Species**: Similar to the pheasant-tailed jacana, other jacana species also exhibit polyandry and sexual dimorphism reversal, where females are larger and more aggressive, competing for multiple males who take on the parental duties.\n\n4. **Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularius)**: In this species, females are larger and more aggressive than males. They engage in polyandrous mating systems, where they may mate with multiple males, who then take on the responsibility of incubating eggs and caring for the chicks.\n\n### Mechanisms Behind Reverse Sexual Dimorphism:\n\n- **Parental Investment**: In polyandrous systems, the male's role often shifts to that of a caregiver, which can lead to a selection pressure on females to be more competitive and thus evolve traits that enhance their attractiveness to males.\n  \n- **Sexual Selection**: The dynamics of sexual selection can change in polyandrous species, leading to females developing traits that are typically associated with male competition in other species. This is supported by the observation that in species with more pronounced polyandry, sexual dimorphism tends to be more extreme.\n\n- **Aggression and Competition**: Larger females may be more aggressive in competing for mates, which can further reinforce the selection for size and ornamentation in females.\n\nIn summary, reverse sexual dimorphism in polyandrous species is characterized by females being larger and more ornamented than males, often accompanied by a reversal of traditional sex roles where males provide parental care. Examples include the pheasant-tailed jacana, various species within the Syngnathidae family, and the spotted sandpiper, all of which illustrate the complex interplay between mating systems and sexual selection.
