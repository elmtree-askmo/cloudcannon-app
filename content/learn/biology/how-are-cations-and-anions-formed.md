    How are cations and anions formed?
answer: >-
    Cations and anions are formed through the process of electron transfer between atoms, which is a fundamental aspect of ionic bonding.\n\n### Formation of Cations\nCations are positively charged ions that result from the loss of one or more electrons by an atom. This typically occurs with metals, which have a tendency to lose electrons due to their lower electronegativity. For example, in the case of sodium (Na), it has one electron in its outermost shell. When sodium loses this electron, it becomes a sodium cation (Na⁺):\n\n$$\n\text{Na} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + e^-\n$$\n\n### Formation of Anions\nAnions are negatively charged ions formed by the gain of one or more electrons by an atom. This process usually occurs with non-metals, which have higher electronegativities and a greater tendency to attract electrons. For instance, chlorine (Cl) has seven electrons in its outer shell and needs one more to achieve a stable octet configuration. When chlorine gains an electron, it becomes a chloride anion (Cl⁻):\n\n$$\n\text{Cl} + e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}^-\n$$\n\n### Summary of the Process\n1. **Electron Transfer**: In ionic bonding, one atom (usually a metal) donates electrons, while another atom (usually a non-metal) accepts them.\n2. **Cation Formation**: The atom that loses electrons becomes a cation (positively charged).\n3. **Anion Formation**: The atom that gains electrons becomes an anion (negatively charged).\n4. **Electrostatic Attraction**: The resulting cations and anions are held together by strong electrostatic forces, forming ionic compounds.\n\nThis process is crucial in various biological functions, such as nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction, where ions like sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) play essential roles.
