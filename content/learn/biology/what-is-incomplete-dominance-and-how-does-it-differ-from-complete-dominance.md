    What is incomplete dominance and how does it differ from complete dominance?
answer: >-
    Incomplete dominance is a form of genetic interaction where neither allele in a gene pair completely masks the other. This results in a phenotype that is an intermediate blend of the two parental traits. For example, when a red-flowered plant is crossed with a white-flowered plant, the offspring may exhibit pink flowers, demonstrating that both alleles contribute to the phenotype without one being fully dominant over the other.\n\nIn contrast, complete dominance occurs when the dominant allele completely masks the effect of the recessive allele in a heterozygous condition. In this case, the phenotype of the heterozygote will express only the dominant trait. For instance, if a plant with a dominant allele for purple flowers is crossed with a plant with a recessive allele for white flowers, all offspring will display the purple flower phenotype, as the dominant trait completely overshadows the recessive one.\n\nThe key differences between incomplete dominance and complete dominance are:\n\n1. **Phenotypic Expression**: Incomplete dominance results in an intermediate phenotype (e.g., pink flowers from red and white parents), while complete dominance results in the dominant phenotype being expressed (e.g., purple flowers from a purple and white parent).\n\n2. **Allelic Interaction**: In incomplete dominance, both alleles contribute to the phenotype, whereas in complete dominance, the dominant allele completely masks the effect of the recessive allele.\n\n3. **Genotypic Ratios**: In a typical cross involving incomplete dominance, the F2 generation from heterozygous parents will show a phenotypic ratio of 1:2:1 (one homozygous dominant, two heterozygous, and one homozygous recessive), while in complete dominance, the ratio is often 3:1 for dominant to recessive traits.\n\nOverall, incomplete dominance introduces a blending of traits, while complete dominance results in a clear distinction between dominant and recessive traits.
