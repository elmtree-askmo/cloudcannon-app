    What is the primary biological function of nucleic acids?
answer: >-
    The primary biological function of nucleic acids, which include DNA and RNA, is the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information. \n\n1. **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**: DNA serves as the genetic blueprint for all living organisms. It contains the instructions needed for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of organisms. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes the information necessary to produce proteins, which perform a vast array of functions within cells.\n\n2. **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**: RNA plays several roles in the expression of genetic information. It acts as a messenger (mRNA) that carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized. Additionally, RNA can have catalytic functions (as seen in ribozymes) and is involved in the regulation of gene expression (as in various types of non-coding RNAs).\n\nThe synthesis of nucleic acids occurs through dehydration reactions that form phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides, creating the primary structure of these molecules. This structural integrity is crucial for their biological functions, including the accurate replication of genetic material during cell division and the proper expression of genes.\n\nIn summary, the primary biological functions of nucleic acids are centered around the storage and expression of genetic information, which is fundamental to the continuity of life and the functioning of all living organisms.
