    Provide an example of a sex-limited trait and its phenotypic outcome.
answer: >-
    A classic example of a sex-limited trait is milk production in dairy cattle. In this case, the genes responsible for milk yield and quality are present in both male (bulls) and female (cows) cattle. However, the phenotypic expression of this trait is limited to female cattle due to the influence of sex hormones, specifically those related to lactation. \n\nIn a genetic cross, even if both male and female offspring inherit the alleles associated with milk production, only the females will exhibit the ability to produce milk. This illustrates how sex-limited traits can be present in both sexes at the genetic level but are only expressed phenotypically in one sex, influenced by hormonal factors. \n\nAnother example can be seen in certain breeds of chickens, where specific feather patterns are expressed only in males, despite both sexes carrying the alleles for these traits. This further emphasizes the role of sex hormones in determining the expression of sex-limited traits.
