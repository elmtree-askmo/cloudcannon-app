    What happens to glucose during cellular respiration?
answer: >-
    During cellular respiration, glucose undergoes a series of biochemical reactions that convert its stored chemical energy into a usable form of energy, primarily in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs in the mitochondria of both plant and animal cells and can be summarized in the following steps:\n\n1. **Glycolysis**: This is the first stage of cellular respiration, which occurs in the cytoplasm. In glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a small amount of ATP and reduces NAD⁺ to NADH, which carries electrons to the next stages.\n\n   The overall reaction for glycolysis can be represented as:\n   $$\n   C_6H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow 2 \text{C}_3H_4O_3 + 2 \text{ATP} + 2 \text{NADH}\n   $$\n\n2. **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: If oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is transported into the mitochondria, where it is further oxidized in the Krebs cycle. This cycle produces additional NADH and FADH₂, as well as a small amount of ATP, while releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) as a waste product.\n\n   The general reaction for the Krebs cycle can be summarized as:\n   $$\n   \text{Acetyl-CoA} + 3 \text{NAD}^+ + \text{FAD} + \text{GDP} + \text{P}_i \rightarrow 3 \text{NADH} + \text{FADH}_2 + \text{ATP} + 2 \text{CO}_2\n   $$\n\n3. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC)**: The NADH and FADH₂ produced in the previous steps carry high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons move through the chain, they release energy, which is used to pump protons (H⁺ ions) across the membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through a process called oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n   The final electron acceptor in the chain is oxygen (O₂), which combines with the electrons and protons to form water (H₂O):\n   $$\n   4 \text{e}^- + 4 \text{H}^+ + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2O\n   $$\n\nOverall, the complete reaction for cellular respiration can be summarized as:\n$$\nC_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{ATP}\n$$\n\nIn summary, during cellular respiration, glucose is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, while releasing energy stored in the glucose molecule as ATP. This process is crucial for providing energy for various biological functions in living organisms.
