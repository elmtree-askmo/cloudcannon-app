    How can you predict the complementary strand of a given DNA sequence?
answer: >-
    To predict the complementary strand of a given DNA sequence, you can follow the rules of complementary base pairing. Each nitrogenous base in DNA pairs with a specific partner:\n\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)\n- Thymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A)\n- Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G)\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)\n\nGiven a DNA strand, you can determine the complementary strand by replacing each base with its corresponding pair. Additionally, it's important to note the directionality of the strands; DNA strands are antiparallel, meaning one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction while the complementary strand runs in the 3' to 5' direction.\n\n### Example\nIf you have the following DNA sequence:\n\n5’ – T - A - C - G - G - T - A - A - G - G - C - C - A - T - C – 3’\n\nTo find the complementary strand, you would pair each base as follows:\n\n- T pairs with A\n- A pairs with T\n- C pairs with G\n- G pairs with C\n\nThus, the complementary strand would be:\n\n3’ – A - T - G - C - C - A - T - T - C - C - G - G - T - A - G – 5’\n\n### Summary Steps\n1. Write down the original DNA sequence.\n2. Use the base pairing rules to determine the complementary bases.\n3. Reverse the order of the bases to reflect the antiparallel nature of DNA strands.\n\nThis method allows you to accurately predict the complementary strand of any given DNA sequence.
