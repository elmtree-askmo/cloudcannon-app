    What is meant by equilibrium frequency in the context of fitness dynamics?
answer: >-
    In the context of fitness dynamics, **equilibrium frequency** refers to the specific point at which the fitness levels of two or more competing strategies or species are equal. This concept is crucial in understanding how populations interact and evolve over time, particularly under conditions of frequency-dependent selection.\n\nWhen two species or strategies are in competition, their relative fitness can fluctuate based on their population frequencies. The equilibrium frequency is achieved when the fitness payoffs for each strategy are balanced, meaning that neither strategy has a selective advantage over the other. At this point, the population dynamics stabilize, and the proportions of the competing strategies remain constant unless external factors disrupt this balance.\n\nMathematically, the equilibrium condition can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nW_h = W_d\n$$\n\nwhere $ W_h $ and $ W_d $ represent the fitness levels of the two competing strategies (e.g., hogs and dogs). When these fitness levels are equal, the population can maintain a stable frequency of each strategy.\n\nUnderstanding equilibrium frequency is essential for predicting how populations will respond to changes in their environment, competition, and other evolutionary pressures. It also highlights the importance of relative fitness in shaping evolutionary strategies, as shifts in population dynamics can lead to changes in the equilibrium frequency over time.
