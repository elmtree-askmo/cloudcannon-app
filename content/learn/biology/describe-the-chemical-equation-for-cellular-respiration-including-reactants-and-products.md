    Describe the chemical equation for cellular respiration, including reactants and products.
answer: >-
    The chemical equation for cellular respiration represents the process by which organisms convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. The overall equation can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nC_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{Energy (ATP)}\n$$\n\n### Reactants:\n- **Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)**: A simple sugar that serves as the primary energy source for cells.\n- **Oxygen (O₂)**: A gas that is essential for aerobic respiration.\n\n### Products:\n- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: A waste product released back into the atmosphere.\n- **Water (H₂O)**: Another byproduct of the reaction.\n- **Energy (ATP)**: Adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of the cell, which is used for various cellular functions.\n\n### Process Overview:\nCellular respiration occurs primarily in the mitochondria of cells and involves several stages, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. This process is crucial for all living organisms as it provides the energy necessary for growth, reproduction, and maintenance of cellular functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in the carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide, which can be utilized by plants during photosynthesis.
