    What are some common examples of disaccharides?
answer: >-
    Disaccharides are carbohydrates formed by the linkage of two monosaccharides through a glycosidic bond, typically via a dehydration reaction. Some common examples of disaccharides include:\n\n1. **Sucrose**: Composed of glucose and fructose, sucrose is commonly known as table sugar and is found in many plants.\n2. **Lactose**: This disaccharide consists of glucose and galactose and is primarily found in milk and dairy products.\n3. **Maltose**: Formed from two glucose molecules, maltose is often found in malted foods and beverages, as well as in the process of starch digestion.\n\nDisaccharides play a significant role in energy transport and can be hydrolyzed into their monosaccharide components for use in metabolic processes.
