    What is the difference between diffusion and osmosis in passive transport?
answer: >-
    The difference between diffusion and osmosis in passive transport lies primarily in the type of substances being transported and the specific mechanisms involved.\n\n### Diffusion\n- **Definition**: Diffusion is the process by which molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. This process can involve various types of molecules, including gases (like oxygen and carbon dioxide) and small nonpolar molecules.\n- **Mechanism**: Molecules move directly through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane or through protein channels if they are larger or polar. This movement occurs spontaneously and does not require energy.\n\n### Osmosis\n- **Definition**: Osmosis is a specific type of diffusion that refers exclusively to the movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. Water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (higher water concentration) to an area of higher solute concentration (lower water concentration).\n- **Mechanism**: Osmosis can occur through the lipid bilayer, but it is often facilitated by specialized water channels known as aquaporins, which allow for the rapid transport of water molecules.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Substances Involved**:\n   - **Diffusion**: Involves various types of molecules (e.g., gases, small solutes).\n   - **Osmosis**: Specifically involves water molecules.\n\n2. **Concentration Gradient**:\n   - **Diffusion**: Molecules move from high to low concentration.\n   - **Osmosis**: Water moves from low solute concentration to high solute concentration.\n\n3. **Mechanisms**:\n   - **Diffusion**: Can occur through the lipid bilayer or via protein channels.\n   - **Osmosis**: Primarily facilitated by aquaporins in addition to passing through the lipid bilayer.\n\nIn summary, while both diffusion and osmosis are forms of passive transport that do not require energy, they differ in the types of molecules involved and the specific processes by which they occur. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending how cells maintain homeostasis and manage the movement of substances across their membranes.
