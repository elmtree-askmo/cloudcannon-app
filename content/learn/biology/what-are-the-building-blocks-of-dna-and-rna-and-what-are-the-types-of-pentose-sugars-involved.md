    What are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, and what are the types of pentose sugars involved?
answer: >-
    The building blocks of DNA and RNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three main components:\n\n1. **A five-carbon sugar**: \n   - In DNA, the sugar is **deoxyribose**, which is characterized by the absence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon. This structural difference is crucial as it distinguishes DNA from RNA.\n   - In RNA, the sugar is **ribose**, which contains a hydroxyl group on the 2' carbon.\n\n2. **A phosphate group**: This group is attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar and is involved in forming the phosphodiester bonds that link nucleotides together to create the nucleic acid backbone.\n\n3. **A nitrogenous base**: There are two categories of nitrogenous bases:\n   - **Purines**: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G).\n   - **Pyrimidines**: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) in DNA, and Uracil (U) in RNA.\n\nThe differences in the sugar components (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA) are significant as they affect the stability and function of the nucleic acids. DNA is typically double-stranded and serves as the genetic blueprint, while RNA is usually single-stranded and plays various roles in protein synthesis and gene regulation.\n\nIn summary, the types of pentose sugars involved in nucleic acids are:\n- **Deoxyribose** (found in DNA)\n- **Ribose** (found in RNA)
