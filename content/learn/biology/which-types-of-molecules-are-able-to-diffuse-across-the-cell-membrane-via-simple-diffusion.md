    Which types of molecules are able to diffuse across the cell membrane via simple diffusion?
answer: >-
    Molecules that are able to diffuse across the cell membrane via simple diffusion are typically small, nonpolar, and some very small polar molecules. The key characteristics of these molecules include:\n\n1. **Small Nonpolar Molecules**: These molecules can easily pass through the lipid bilayer due to their hydrophobic nature. Examples include:\n   - **Gases**: Oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) can diffuse directly through the membrane without assistance.\n   - **Lipids**: Nonpolar lipids, such as steroid hormones, can also diffuse freely across the membrane.\n\n2. **Very Small Polar Molecules**: While polar molecules generally have more difficulty crossing the hydrophobic lipid bilayer, some very small polar molecules can still diffuse through. A notable example is:\n   - **Water (H₂O)**: Although water can also move through specialized channels (aquaporins), it can diffuse across the membrane to a limited extent.\n\nIn summary, the types of molecules that can diffuse across the cell membrane via simple diffusion include small nonpolar molecules (like O₂ and CO₂) and very small polar molecules (like water). This process occurs down the concentration gradient and continues until equilibrium is reached, contributing to cellular homeostasis.
