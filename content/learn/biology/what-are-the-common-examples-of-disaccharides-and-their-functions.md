    What are the common examples of disaccharides and their functions?
answer: >-
    Disaccharides are carbohydrates formed by the linkage of two monosaccharides through a glycosidic bond, typically via a dehydration reaction. Here are some common examples of disaccharides along with their functions:\n\n1. **Sucrose**: \n   - **Composition**: Sucrose is composed of glucose and fructose.\n   - **Function**: Commonly known as table sugar, sucrose serves as a primary energy source for many plants and is widely used in food products. It is easily hydrolyzed into its monosaccharide components for energy metabolism.\n\n2. **Lactose**: \n   - **Composition**: Lactose consists of glucose and galactose.\n   - **Function**: Found primarily in milk and dairy products, lactose provides energy to infants and young mammals. It can be broken down by the enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose, which are then utilized for energy.\n\n3. **Maltose**: \n   - **Composition**: Maltose is formed from two glucose molecules.\n   - **Function**: Often found in malted foods and beverages, maltose plays a role in the digestion of starch. It is hydrolyzed into glucose units, which can be readily used for energy.\n\nDisaccharides are important for energy transport in biological systems and can be hydrolyzed into their monosaccharide components for use in various metabolic processes. Their solubility in water allows them to be easily transported in biological fluids, facilitating their role in energy supply.
