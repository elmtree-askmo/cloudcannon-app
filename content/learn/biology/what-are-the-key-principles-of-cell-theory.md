    What are the key principles of cell theory?
answer: >-
    The key principles of cell theory are foundational concepts in biology that describe the nature and function of cells. The cell theory is primarily based on three main postulates:\n\n1. **All living organisms are composed of cells**: This principle states that all forms of life, whether unicellular (like bacteria) or multicellular (like plants and animals), are made up of one or more cells. Cells are recognized as the basic structural units of life.\n\n2. **Cells are the basic unit of life**: This principle emphasizes that cells are the smallest units that can carry out all life processes. They serve as the fundamental building blocks of all living organisms, performing essential functions necessary for survival and reproduction.\n\n3. **All cells arise from pre-existing cells**: This principle asserts that new cells are produced only from the division of existing cells. This concept was a significant advancement in understanding biological processes, as it refuted earlier notions of spontaneous generation.\n\nThe formulation of cell theory is credited to German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden in the 1830s, with later contributions from Rudolf Virchow. The cell theory serves as a cornerstone of biological sciences, providing a unified framework for understanding the cellular basis of life and the interrelationships among living organisms.
