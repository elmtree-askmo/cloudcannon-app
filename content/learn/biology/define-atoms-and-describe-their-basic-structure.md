    Define atoms and describe their basic structure.
answer: >-
    Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, and they are the smallest units of an element that retain the properties of that element. Each atom consists of three main subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n\n### Basic Structure of Atoms\n\n1. **Nucleus**: \n   - The nucleus is the central part of the atom and contains protons and neutrons.\n   - **Protons**: These are positively charged particles. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number of the element. For example, hydrogen has one proton, while carbon has six.\n   - **Neutrons**: These are neutral particles, meaning they have no charge. Neutrons contribute to the atomic mass of the atom but do not affect its charge. The number of neutrons can vary in atoms of the same element, leading to the formation of isotopes.\n\n2. **Electron Shells**: \n   - Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. \n   - The arrangement of electrons in these shells is crucial for determining how an atom interacts with other atoms and forms chemical bonds. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, balancing the overall charge.\n\n### Key Characteristics of Atoms\n\n- **Atomic Number**: This is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and is unique to each element. It determines the identity of the element.\n- **Atomic Mass**: This is the weighted average mass of an element's isotopes, roughly equal to the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n- **Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different atomic masses.\n\nIn summary, atoms are composed of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in various energy levels. This structure is fundamental to understanding the properties of elements and their interactions in chemical reactions.
