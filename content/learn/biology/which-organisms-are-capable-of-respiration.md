    Which organisms are capable of respiration?
answer: >-
    All organisms are capable of respiration, which is a vital process for energy production. This includes a wide variety of living entities such as:\n\n1. **Plants**: While they are known for photosynthesis, plants also perform respiration, especially during the night or in the absence of light, to break down sugars and release energy.\n\n2. **Animals**: All animals rely on respiration to convert glucose into energy, primarily using oxygen in a process known as aerobic respiration. This process results in the production of carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.\n\n3. **Bacteria**: Many bacteria are capable of respiration, utilizing various substrates for energy. Some bacteria perform aerobic respiration, while others may engage in anaerobic respiration, which does not require oxygen.\n\n4. **Fungi**: Fungi also respire, breaking down organic matter to obtain energy, and they can do so in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\n\nIn summary, respiration is a universal process among living organisms, essential for energy release and cellular functions, regardless of whether they are photosynthetic or not.
