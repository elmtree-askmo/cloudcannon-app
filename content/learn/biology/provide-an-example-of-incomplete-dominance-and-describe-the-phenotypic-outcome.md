    Provide an example of incomplete dominance and describe the phenotypic outcome.
answer: >-
    An example of incomplete dominance can be observed in the crossing of snapdragon flowers. When a red flower (homozygous, RR) is crossed with a white flower (homozygous, WW), the resulting offspring (heterozygous, RW) exhibit a pink phenotype. This pink flower is an intermediate expression between the red and white parent flowers, demonstrating that neither allele is completely dominant over the other.\n\n### Phenotypic Outcome\nIn this case, the phenotypic outcome is characterized by the following:\n\n- **Parental Generation**: \n  - Red flowers (RR)\n  - White flowers (WW)\n\n- **F1 Generation**: \n  - All offspring are pink flowers (RW), which is the intermediate phenotype.\n\n- **F2 Generation**: \n  - If two pink flowers (RW) are crossed, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation would be 1 red (RR): 2 pink (RW): 1 white (WW), resulting in a 1:2:1 ratio.\n\nThis example illustrates how incomplete dominance leads to a blending of traits, resulting in a distinct phenotype that is not present in either parent. This pattern of inheritance can have significant implications for genetic variability and trait expression in populations.
