    This example explains incomplete dominance using snapdragon flowers, where a cross between red and white flowers results in pink offspring, illustrating an intermediate phenotype that is distinct from both parents.

    Provide an example of incomplete dominance and describe the phenotypic outcome.
answer: >-
    An example of incomplete dominance can be observed in the crossing of snapdragon flowers. When a red flower (homozygous, RR) is crossed with a white flower (homozygous, WW), the resulting offspring (heterozygous, RW) exhibit a pink phenotype. This pink flower is an intermediate expression between the red and white parent flowers, demonstrating that neither allele is completely dominant over the other.\n\n### Phenotypic Outcome\nIn this case, the phenotypic outcome is characterized by the following:\n\n- **Parental Generation**: \n  - Red flowers (RR)\n  - White flowers (WW)\n\n- **F1 Generation**: \n  - All offspring are pink flowers (RW), which is the intermediate phenotype.\n\n- **F2 Generation**: \n  - If two pink flowers (RW) are crossed, the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation would be 1 red (RR): 2 pink (RW): 1 white (WW), resulting in a 1:2:1 ratio.\n\nThis example illustrates how incomplete dominance leads to a blending of traits, resulting in a distinct phenotype that is not present in either parent. This pattern of inheritance can have significant implications for genetic variability and trait expression in populations.
