    What types of materials are typically transported via passive transport methods?
answer: >-
    Passive transport methods allow materials to move across cell membranes without the expenditure of energy, relying instead on concentration gradients. The types of materials typically transported via passive transport include:\n\n1. **Gases**: Small nonpolar molecules such as oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) can diffuse freely across the lipid bilayer due to their size and nonpolar nature.\n\n2. **Small Lipids**: Lipid-soluble substances, including fatty acids and steroid hormones, can pass through the membrane easily because they can dissolve in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer.\n\n3. **Small Polar Molecules**: While larger polar molecules cannot pass through the membrane directly, some small polar molecules, such as water (H₂O), can diffuse through the membrane, albeit at a slower rate compared to nonpolar molecules.\n\n4. **Ions and Larger Polar Molecules**: These substances typically require facilitated diffusion through specific transport proteins (channels or carriers) to cross the membrane. Examples include ions (like Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻) and larger polar molecules such as glucose.\n\nIn summary, passive transport primarily facilitates the movement of gases, small lipids, and small polar molecules, while larger polar molecules and ions require specific transport proteins to assist in their movement across the membrane.
