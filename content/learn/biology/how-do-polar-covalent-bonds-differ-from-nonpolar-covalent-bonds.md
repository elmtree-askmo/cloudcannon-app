    How do polar covalent bonds differ from nonpolar covalent bonds?
answer: >-
    Polar covalent bonds and nonpolar covalent bonds differ primarily in how electrons are shared between the atoms involved, which is influenced by the electronegativity of those atoms.\n\n### Polar Covalent Bonds\nIn polar covalent bonds, electrons are shared unequally between two atoms. This occurs when one atom has a higher electronegativity than the other, meaning it has a stronger attraction for the shared electrons. As a result, the atom with the higher electronegativity acquires a partial negative charge (δ-), while the other atom acquires a partial positive charge (δ+). A classic example of a polar covalent bond is found in water (H₂O), where the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, leading to a dipole moment in the molecule. This dipole moment is responsible for many of water's unique properties, such as its high surface tension and solvent capabilities.\n\n### Nonpolar Covalent Bonds\nIn contrast, nonpolar covalent bonds occur when electrons are shared equally between two atoms. This typically happens when the atoms involved have similar electronegativities, resulting in no charge separation within the molecule. An example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in molecular oxygen (O₂), where two oxygen atoms share electrons equally. Because there is no difference in electronegativity, the molecule does not exhibit any partial charges.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Electron Sharing**:\n  - **Polar Covalent Bonds**: Unequal sharing of electrons, leading to partial charges on the atoms.\n  - **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: Equal sharing of electrons, resulting in no charge separation.\n\n- **Electronegativity**:\n  - **Polar Covalent Bonds**: Involves atoms with different electronegativities.\n  - **Nonpolar Covalent Bonds**: Involves atoms with similar electronegativities.\n\nThis difference in electron sharing significantly affects the physical and chemical properties of the molecules formed, including their solubility, boiling and melting points, and interactions with other molecules.
