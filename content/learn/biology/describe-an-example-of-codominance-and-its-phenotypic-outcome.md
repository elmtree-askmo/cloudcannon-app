    Describe an example of codominance and its phenotypic outcome.
answer: >-
    An excellent example of codominance is found in the ABO blood group system. In this system, there are three alleles: IA, IB, and i. The IA allele codes for the A antigen, the IB allele codes for the B antigen, and the i allele is recessive and does not produce any antigen. \n\nWhen an individual inherits the IA allele from one parent and the IB allele from the other, they express both A and B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells, resulting in blood type AB. This is a clear demonstration of codominance, as both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype without blending. \n\nThe phenotypic outcome of this codominance is significant, especially in medical contexts such as blood transfusions, where the presence of both A and B antigens can affect compatibility. Mismatched blood types can lead to serious immune reactions, highlighting the importance of understanding these genetic principles in healthcare.\n\nIn summary, the AB blood type exemplifies codominance, showcasing how both alleles are fully expressed and contribute to the individual's phenotype.
