    How does light microscopy differ from electron microscopy in terms of resolution limits?
answer: >-
    Light microscopy and electron microscopy differ significantly in their resolution limits, which is a crucial factor in selecting the appropriate technique for specific applications in cell biology.\n\n1. **Light Microscopy**: The resolution limit of light microscopy is approximately 200 nanometers. This means that it can distinguish two points that are at least 200 nanometers apart. Light microscopy is commonly used for observing live cells and can utilize various techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy, to enhance visualization of specific cellular components.\n\n2. **Electron Microscopy**: In contrast, electron microscopy (EM) achieves much higher resolution, down to about 0.1 nanometers. This allows for the visualization of much smaller structures within cells, such as organelles and macromolecular complexes. However, electron microscopy cannot be used to observe live cells, as the process requires a vacuum and often involves sample preparation that can alter or destroy the specimen.\n\nIn summary, the key difference in resolution limits is that light microscopy can resolve structures down to 200 nanometers, while electron microscopy can resolve structures down to 0.1 nanometers. This significant difference makes electron microscopy a powerful tool for studying the ultrastructure of cells, while light microscopy remains essential for live cell imaging and dynamic processes.
