    What is facilitated diffusion and how does it differ from simple diffusion?
answer: >-
    Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that allows specific molecules to cross a biological membrane with the assistance of specialized transmembrane proteins, such as channel proteins and carrier proteins. This process occurs along the concentration gradient, meaning that molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without the direct use of energy (ATP).\n\nThe key differences between facilitated diffusion and simple diffusion are as follows:\n\n1. **Mechanism**: \n   - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Involves the use of transport proteins (channel or carrier proteins) to help move larger or polar molecules that cannot easily pass through the lipid bilayer of the membrane.\n   - **Simple Diffusion**: Does not require any proteins; molecules move directly through the membrane based on their concentration gradient. This process is typically limited to small, non-polar molecules (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide).\n\n2. **Substance Type**:\n   - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Commonly involves larger or polar molecules, such as glucose and ions, which are not able to diffuse freely through the lipid bilayer.\n   - **Simple Diffusion**: Primarily involves small, non-polar molecules that can easily pass through the membrane.\n\n3. **Transport Proteins**:\n   - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Requires specific transmembrane proteins to facilitate the transport of substances.\n   - **Simple Diffusion**: Does not involve any transport proteins; the movement occurs directly through the membrane.\n\nIn summary, while both facilitated diffusion and simple diffusion are passive transport mechanisms that do not require energy, facilitated diffusion is characterized by the involvement of specific proteins to assist in the transport of larger or polar molecules across the membrane, whereas simple diffusion allows small, non-polar molecules to pass freely through the membrane.
