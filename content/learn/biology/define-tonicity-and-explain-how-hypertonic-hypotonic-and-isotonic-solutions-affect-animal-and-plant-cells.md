    Define tonicity and explain how hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic solutions affect animal and plant cells.
answer: >-
    Tonicity is a term that describes the ability of a solution to influence the volume of a cell through the process of osmosis. It is determined by the relative concentrations of solutes in the solution compared to the inside of the cell. There are three primary types of tonicity: hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic.\n\n1. **Hypertonic Solutions**: A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. When an animal or plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cell to the area of higher solute concentration. This results in the cell losing water, causing it to shrink or crenate in the case of animal cells. In plant cells, the loss of water leads to a decrease in turgor pressure, which can cause wilting.\n\n2. **Hypotonic Solutions**: A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. When cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell, where the solute concentration is higher. For animal cells, this can lead to swelling and potentially bursting (lysis) if the influx of water is excessive. In plant cells, the influx of water increases turgor pressure, which is beneficial as it helps maintain the plant's structure and rigidity.\n\n3. **Isotonic Solutions**: An isotonic solution has an equal solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. In this scenario, there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell, meaning that the cell maintains its normal shape and volume. This state is ideal for both animal and plant cells, as it allows for proper cellular function without the stress of swelling or shrinking.\n\nIn summary, the effects of tonicity on cells are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Hypertonic solutions cause cells to lose water, hypotonic solutions lead to water gain, and isotonic solutions maintain equilibrium. Understanding these concepts is essential for various biological processes, including osmoregulation and the overall health of cells.
