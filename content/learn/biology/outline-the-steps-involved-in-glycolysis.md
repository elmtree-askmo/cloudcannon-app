    Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, generating energy in the form of ATP and NADH. It consists of ten enzyme-catalyzed steps, which can be divided into two main phases: the energy investment phase and the energy generation phase. Below is an outline of the steps involved in glycolysis:\n\n### Energy Investment Phase (Steps 1-5)\n1. **Hexokinase Reaction**: Glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) using one molecule of ATP. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase.\n   \n2. **Isomerization**: Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase.\n\n3. **Phosphorylation**: Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) using another molecule of ATP. This step is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), which is a key regulatory step in glycolysis.\n\n4. **Cleavage**: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) by the enzyme aldolase.\n\n5. **Isomerization**: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, so now there are two molecules of GAP available for the next steps.\n\n### Energy Generation Phase (Steps 6-10)\n6. **Oxidation and Phosphorylation**: Each glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized, and an inorganic phosphate is added to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). This reaction produces NADH from NAD+. The enzyme involved is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\n\n7. **ATP Generation**: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP and is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase. This step is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\n8. **Isomerization**: 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) by the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase.\n\n9. **Dehydration**: 2-phosphoglycerate is dehydrated to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by the enzyme enolase.\n\n10. **ATP Generation**: Phosphoenolpyruvate donates a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP and is converted into pyruvate by the enzyme pyruvate kinase. This step also represents another instance of substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\n### Summary\nThe overall reaction of glycolysis can be summarized as follows:\n$$\nC_6H_{12}O_6 + 2 \text{ADP} + 2 \text{Pi} + 2 \text{NAD}^+ \rightarrow 2 \text{C}_3H_4O_3 + 2 \text{H}_2O + 2 \text{ATP} + 2 \text{NADH} + 2 \text{H}^+\n$$\n\nIn summary, glycolysis is a vital metabolic pathway that not only breaks down glucose into pyruvate but also generates energy in the form of ATP and NADH, playing a key role in cellular metabolism.
