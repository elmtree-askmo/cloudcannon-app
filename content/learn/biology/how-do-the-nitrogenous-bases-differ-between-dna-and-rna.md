    How do the nitrogenous bases differ between DNA and RNA?
answer: >-
    The nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA differ primarily in their composition and structure. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Types of Nitrogenous Bases**:\n   - **DNA** contains four nitrogenous bases:\n     - Adenine (A)\n     - Thymine (T)\n     - Cytosine (C)\n     - Guanine (G)\n   - **RNA** also contains four nitrogenous bases, but it substitutes one base:\n     - Adenine (A)\n     - Uracil (U) (replaces thymine)\n     - Cytosine (C)\n     - Guanine (G)\n\n2. **Base Pairing**:\n   - In DNA, the base pairing occurs as follows:\n     - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds.\n     - Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) through three hydrogen bonds.\n   - In RNA, the base pairing is slightly different due to the presence of uracil:\n     - Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) through two hydrogen bonds.\n     - Guanine (G) still pairs with Cytosine (C) through three hydrogen bonds.\n\n3. **Structural Differences**:\n   - The presence of thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA is a significant distinction. Thymine has a methyl group that uracil lacks, which contributes to the stability of DNA.\n   - Additionally, DNA is typically double-stranded and forms a double helix, while RNA is usually single-stranded and can fold into various shapes.\n\n4. **Functional Implications**:\n   - The differences in nitrogenous bases contribute to the distinct roles of DNA and RNA in biological systems. DNA serves primarily as the genetic blueprint for organisms, while RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and various regulatory functions.\n\nIn summary, the primary differences between the nitrogenous bases of DNA and RNA lie in the presence of thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA, which affects base pairing and the overall structure and function of these nucleic acids.
