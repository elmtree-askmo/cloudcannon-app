answer: >-
    Well-established scientific theories are foundational explanations in various fields of science, supported by extensive evidence and experimentation. Here are some prominent examples:\n\n1. **Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection**: This theory, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how species evolve over time through the process of natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\n2. **Theory of General Relativity**: Formulated by Albert Einstein, this theory describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It has been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations, such as the bending of light around massive objects.\n\n3. **Quantum Theory**: This theory provides a framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It has led to significant advancements in technology, including semiconductors and lasers.\n\n4. **Atomic Theory**: This theory posits that matter is composed of atoms, which are the fundamental building blocks of all substances. It explains the properties of matter and the interactions between different elements.\n\n5. **Plate Tectonics Theory**: This geological theory explains the movement of the Earth's lithospheric plates and accounts for phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges.\n\n6. **Germ Theory of Disease**: This theory states that many diseases are caused by microorganisms. It revolutionized medicine and led to the development of antibiotics and improved hygiene practices.\n\n7. **Heliocentric Theory**: Proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus, this theory posits that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, fundamentally changing our understanding of the solar system.\n\nThese theories exemplify the rigorous scientific process, where hypotheses are tested and refined based on empirical evidence, leading to well-substantiated explanations of natural phenomena.
