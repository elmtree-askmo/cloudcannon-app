    What are the main carbon reservoirs in the carbon cycle?
answer: >-
    The main carbon reservoirs in the carbon cycle are:\n\n1. **Atmosphere**: Carbon is stored in the atmosphere primarily as carbon dioxide (CO2). This reservoir plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and is involved in processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.\n\n2. **Oceans**: The oceans are one of the largest carbon reservoirs, containing dissolved inorganic carbon. They absorb significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, acting as a carbon sink. However, deep ocean waters have limited contact with the atmosphere, which restricts carbon exchange at those depths.\n\n3. **Terrestrial Biosphere**: This includes all living organisms on land and in freshwater systems, as well as organic matter found in soils. Forests, grasslands, and wetlands are significant components of this reservoir, where carbon is stored in biomass and soil organic matter.\n\n4. **Sediments and Fossil Fuels**: Sediments, including fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), represent the largest carbon reservoir, estimated to hold around 65,000,000 gigatons of carbon (GtC). When these fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.\n\nThese reservoirs interact through various processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and human activities such as burning fossil fuels, which influence the overall dynamics of the carbon cycle and climate change.
