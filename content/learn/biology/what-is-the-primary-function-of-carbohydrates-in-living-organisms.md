    What is the primary function of carbohydrates in living organisms?
answer: >-
    The primary function of carbohydrates in living organisms is to serve as a primary source of energy. Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a ratio of 1:2:1. They can be classified into three main categories:\n\n1. **Monosaccharides**: These are simple sugars, such as glucose, which is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production.\n2. **Disaccharides**: These consist of two monosaccharides linked together, such as sucrose (table sugar).\n3. **Polysaccharides**: These are long chains of monosaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, which serve as energy storage molecules. Starch is primarily found in plants, while glycogen is found in animals.\n\nIn addition to their role as an energy source, carbohydrates also provide structural support in various organisms. For example, cellulose is a polysaccharide that forms the cell walls of plants, while chitin serves a similar function in the exoskeletons of arthropods. Furthermore, carbohydrates are involved in cell recognition and signaling processes, as seen in glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are important for cellular communication and interaction.\n\nIn summary, carbohydrates are essential for energy provision, structural integrity, and cellular signaling in living organisms.
