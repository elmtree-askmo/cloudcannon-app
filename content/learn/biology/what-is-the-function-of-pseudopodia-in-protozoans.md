    What is the function of pseudopodia in protozoans?
answer: >-
    Pseudopodia, which are temporary projections of the cytoplasm, serve two primary functions in protozoans, particularly in amoeboid protozoa like *Amoeba sp.*:\n\n1. **Locomotion**: Pseudopodia allow protozoans to move by extending and retracting these projections. This movement is often described as "amoeboid movement," where the organism can change shape and flow in the direction of the pseudopodia, enabling it to navigate through its environment.\n\n2. **Feeding**: Pseudopodia are also crucial for the process of phagocytosis, where the protozoan engulfs food particles. The pseudopodia extend around the food item, enclosing it in a food vacuole where digestion occurs. This method of feeding allows protozoans to obtain nutrients from their surroundings effectively.\n\nIn summary, pseudopodia are essential for both movement and feeding in protozoans, facilitating their survival and adaptability in various environments.
