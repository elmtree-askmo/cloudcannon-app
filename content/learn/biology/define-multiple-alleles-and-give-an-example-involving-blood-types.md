    Define multiple alleles and give an example involving blood types.
answer: >-
    Multiple alleles refer to the presence of more than two alleles for a genetic trait within a population. While an individual can only inherit two alleles (one from each parent), multiple alleles can exist in the broader population, leading to a variety of phenotypes.\n\nA classic example of multiple alleles is the ABO blood group system in humans, which is determined by three alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$. The combinations of these alleles result in four possible blood types:\n\n- **Type A**: Can be either $I^A I^A$ (homozygous) or $I^A i$ (heterozygous).\n- **Type B**: Can be either $I^B I^B$ (homozygous) or $I^B i$ (heterozygous).\n- **Type AB**: Genotype $I^A I^B$, where both alleles are expressed equally, demonstrating codominance.\n- **Type O**: Genotype $ii$, where neither A nor B antigens are present.\n\nIn the case of blood type AB, both the $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles are expressed simultaneously, resulting in the presence of both A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells. This is a clear example of codominance, where both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype. The presence of these antigens is crucial for determining blood type compatibility, especially in medical situations such as blood transfusions, where mismatched blood types can trigger an immune response. \n\nIn summary, the ABO blood group system exemplifies the principles of multiple alleles and codominance in genetics.
