    How does transcription differ from translation in protein synthesis?
answer: >-
    Transcription and translation are two fundamental processes in protein synthesis, each serving distinct roles in gene expression.\n\n### Transcription\nTranscription is the first step in the process of protein synthesis. It involves the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) from a DNA template. Here are the key features of transcription:\n\n1. **Location**: In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, while in prokaryotic cells, it takes place in the cytoplasm.\n2. **Process**: During transcription, the DNA double helix unwinds, and RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA (the promoter). It then synthesizes a single-stranded RNA molecule by adding complementary ribonucleotides to the growing RNA strand. For example, adenine (A) in DNA pairs with uracil (U) in RNA, thymine (T) pairs with adenine (A), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).\n3. **Product**: The result of transcription is a pre-mRNA molecule, which undergoes further processing (such as splicing) to become mature mRNA, ready for translation.\n\n### Translation\nTranslation is the second step in protein synthesis, where the mRNA is decoded to synthesize a protein. Here are the key features of translation:\n\n1. **Location**: Translation occurs in the cytoplasm, specifically at the ribosomes.\n2. **Process**: The ribosome reads the sequence of codons in the mRNA. Each codon, a sequence of three nucleotides, corresponds to a specific amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together in the order specified by the mRNA sequence.\n3. **Product**: The end product of translation is a polypeptide chain, which folds into a functional protein. This process requires energy, typically in the form of ATP.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Function**: Transcription converts DNA information into RNA, while translation decodes RNA to synthesize proteins.\n- **Location**: Transcription occurs in the nucleus (eukaryotes) or cytoplasm (prokaryotes), whereas translation occurs in the cytoplasm.\n- **Molecules Involved**: Transcription involves RNA polymerase and produces mRNA, while translation involves ribosomes, tRNA, and results in polypeptides.\n\nIn summary, transcription and translation are sequential processes that are essential for gene expression and the synthesis of proteins, with each process having its own specific mechanisms and roles.
