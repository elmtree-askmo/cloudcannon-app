answer: >-
    Hydrogen bonds are fundamental to the unique properties of water, which are essential for life and various biological processes. Here are the key contributions of hydrogen bonds to the properties of water:\n\n1. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: Water (H₂O) is a polar molecule due to the difference in electronegativity between oxygen and hydrogen. This polarity allows water molecules to attract each other, forming hydrogen bonds. Each water molecule can form hydrogen bonds with up to three other water molecules, creating a dynamic network of interactions that are constantly forming and breaking. This network is crucial for many of water's unique properties.\n\n2. **High Boiling and Melting Points**: The presence of hydrogen bonds significantly raises the boiling and melting points of water compared to other similar-sized molecules. For instance, while methane (CH₄) is a nonpolar molecule with a much lower boiling point, water remains liquid over a wide range of temperatures, which is vital for biological processes.\n\n3. **Density of Ice**: Hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes, making ice less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats on water, providing an insulating layer that protects aquatic life during cold weather.\n\n4. **Surface Tension**: The hydrogen bonds between water molecules create a high surface tension, allowing small objects to float on its surface and enabling phenomena like water striders to walk on water. This property is crucial for various ecological interactions.\n\n5. **Cohesion and Adhesion**: Water molecules exhibit strong cohesion due to hydrogen bonding, which allows them to stick together. This property is essential for processes like capillary action, where water can move through narrow spaces, such as in plant roots and stems. Adhesion, the attraction between water molecules and other substances, also plays a critical role in the movement of water in biological systems.\n\n6. **Solvent Properties**: Water is often referred to as the "universal solvent" because it can dissolve a wide range of substances. The polar nature of water allows it to interact with and stabilize ions and polar molecules, facilitating biochemical reactions and transport of nutrients in living organisms.\n\n7. **Biological Molecules**: Hydrogen bonds are critical for the structure and function of biomolecules like DNA and proteins. For example, they stabilize the double helix structure of DNA and maintain the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, which are essential for their biological activity.\n\nIn summary, hydrogen bonds are integral to the unique properties of water, influencing its behavior as a solvent, its physical state changes, and its interactions with other molecules, all of which are critical for sustaining life.
