    What are the primary functions of DNA and RNA in the cell?
answer: >-
    The primary functions of DNA and RNA in the cell are distinct yet complementary, playing crucial roles in the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information.\n\n### Functions of DNA:\n1. **Genetic Blueprint**: DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) serves as the genetic material in most organisms. It contains the instructions necessary for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all living organisms and many viruses.\n2. **Storage of Genetic Information**: DNA stores the information required to produce proteins, which are essential for various cellular functions. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA encodes the genetic instructions.\n3. **Replication**: DNA can replicate itself, ensuring that genetic information is passed on during cell division. This process is vital for growth and repair in multicellular organisms.\n4. **Transmission of Genetic Information**: During reproduction, DNA is transmitted from parents to offspring, ensuring the continuity of genetic traits.\n\n### Functions of RNA:\n1. **Protein Synthesis**: RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) plays a critical role in translating the genetic information encoded in DNA into proteins. This process involves several types of RNA:\n   - **mRNA (messenger RNA)**: Carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome, where proteins are synthesized.\n   - **tRNA (transfer RNA)**: Brings the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis, matching them to the codons on the mRNA.\n   - **rRNA (ribosomal RNA)**: A structural component of ribosomes, facilitating the assembly of amino acids into proteins.\n2. **Regulation of Gene Expression**: RNA molecules can also regulate gene expression and play roles in various cellular processes, including splicing, editing, and degradation of mRNA.\n3. **Catalytic Functions**: Some RNA molecules, known as ribozymes, have catalytic properties and can facilitate biochemical reactions, further expanding the functional repertoire of RNA in the cell.\n\nIn summary, DNA primarily serves
