    Gene expression is a crucial biological process that involves two main stages: transcription and translation. These stages are essential for synthesizing proteins, which perform a wide range of functions in living organisms. Below is a detailed description of each process.\n\n### Transcription\n\nTranscription is the first step in gene expression, where the information encoded in a specific segment of DNA is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs in the following steps:\n\n1. **Initiation**: The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter, which is located at the beginning of the gene. This binding unwinds the DNA double helix, exposing the template strand.\n\n2. **Elongation**: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, synthesizing a single strand of mRNA by adding complementary RNA nucleotides. The RNA nucleotides pair with the DNA bases (adenine pairs with uracil in RNA, and cytosine pairs with guanine).\n\n3. **Termination**: The transcription process continues until RNA polymerase reaches a termination signal in the DNA sequence. At this point, the newly synthesized mRNA strand is released, and the DNA helix re-forms.\n\n4. **Post-Transcriptional Modifications** (in eukaryotes): Before the mRNA can be translated, it undergoes several modifications:\n   - **Capping**: A 5' cap is added to the beginning of the mRNA, which helps protect it from degradation and assists in ribosome binding during translation.\n   - **Polyadenylation**: A poly-A tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA, which also aids in stability and export from the nucleus.\n   - **Splicing**: Introns (non-coding regions) are removed, and exons (coding regions) are joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule.\n\n### Translation\n\nTranslation is the second step in gene expression, where the mRNA is decoded to synthesize a protein. This process occurs in the cytoplasm and involves several key components:\n\n1. **Initiation**: The ribosome assembles around the mRNA strand. The small subunit of the ribosome binds to the mRNA, and the first transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, carrying an amino acid, binds to the start codon (AUG) on the mRNA.\n\n2. **Elongation**: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading the codons (three-nucleotide sequences) and facilitating the binding of tRNA molecules that carry specific amino acids. Each tRNA has an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.\n\n3. **Peptide Bond Formation**: The ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain.\n\n4. **Termination**: The process continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. At this point, the completed polypeptide chain is released, and the ribosomal subunits disassemble.\n\n### Summary of Differences Between Transcription and Translation\n\n- **Function**: Transcription converts DNA information into RNA, while translation decodes RNA to synthesize proteins.\n- **Location**: Transcription occurs in the nucleus (in eukaryotes) or cytoplasm (in prokaryotes), whereas translation occurs in the cytoplasm.\n- **Molecules Involved**: Transcription involves RNA polymerase and produces mRNA, while translation involves ribosomes, tRNA, and results in polypeptides.\n\nIn summary, transcription and translation are sequential processes that are essential for gene expression and the synthesis of proteins, with each process having its own specific mechanisms and roles.
