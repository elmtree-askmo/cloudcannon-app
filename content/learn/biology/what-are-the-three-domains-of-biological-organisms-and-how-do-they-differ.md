    What are the three domains of biological organisms and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    The three domains of biological organisms are **Bacteria**, **Archaea**, and **Eukarya**. Each domain is characterized by distinct cellular structures and genetic makeup, which are fundamental to their classification.\n\n1. **Bacteria**: \n   - These are prokaryotic organisms, meaning they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. \n   - Bacteria are typically unicellular and can be found in a wide variety of environments, from soil to water to the human body. \n   - They play essential roles in ecosystems, including nutrient cycling and as pathogens.\n\n2. **Archaea**: \n   - Like bacteria, archaea are also prokaryotic and unicellular. \n   - However, they are genetically and biochemically distinct from bacteria. \n   - Archaea often inhabit extreme environments, such as hot springs, salt lakes, and deep-sea vents, and they have unique metabolic pathways that allow them to thrive in these conditions.\n\n3. **Eukarya**: \n   - This domain includes all eukaryotic organisms, which have complex cells that contain a nucleus and organelles. \n   - Eukarya encompasses a diverse range of life forms, including plants, animals, fungi, and protists. \n   - The complexity of eukaryotic cells allows for greater specialization and organization within multicellular organisms.\n\nThe relationships among these domains can be visualized in a phylogenetic tree, which illustrates the evolutionary connections between different organisms. This classification reflects the fundamental differences in cellular organization and genetic characteristics that define each domain.
