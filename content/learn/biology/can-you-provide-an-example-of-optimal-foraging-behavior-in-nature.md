answer: >-
    An excellent example of optimal foraging behavior in nature can be observed in the foraging strategies of the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). According to the marginal value theorem, starlings optimize their foraging by balancing the time spent traveling to food sources and the time spent handling food once it is found. \n\nWhen starlings are foraging, they will assess the energy profitability of different food patches. If a patch is rich in food, they will spend more time there, but as they deplete the resources, the energy gained per unit of time decreases. The longer the travel time to a new patch, the larger the load they will carry back, as they aim to maximize their net rate of energy gain. This behavior illustrates how starlings make decisions based on the trade-off between search time and handling time, which is a key aspect of optimal foraging theory.\n\nAnother notable example is the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), which exhibits caching behavior. These birds store food in various locations to ensure they have energy reserves during times of scarcity. They switch between different food sources based on availability, demonstrating their ability to adapt their foraging strategies to maximize energy intake.\n\nAdditionally, the common crow (Corvus caurinus) foraging on clams provides a clear example of optimal decision rules for prey-size selectivity. Crows will choose clams based on their size and the energy required to open them, optimizing their foraging efficiency.\n\nThese examples highlight how animals utilize optimal foraging strategies to enhance their energy gain while minimizing the costs associated with searching for and handling food.
