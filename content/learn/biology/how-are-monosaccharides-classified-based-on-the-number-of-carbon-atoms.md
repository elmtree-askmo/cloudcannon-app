    How are monosaccharides classified based on the number of carbon atoms?
answer: >-
    Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbon atoms they contain. This classification includes:\n\n1. **Trioses**: Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms (C3H6O3). An example is glyceraldehyde.\n2. **Tetroses**: Monosaccharides with four carbon atoms (C4H8O4). An example is erythrose.\n3. **Pentoses**: Monosaccharides with five carbon atoms (C5H10O5). Common examples include ribose and xylose.\n4. **Hexoses**: Monosaccharides with six carbon atoms (C6H12O6). Well-known examples are glucose, fructose, and galactose.\n5. **Heptoses**: Monosaccharides with seven carbon atoms (C7H14O7). An example is sedoheptulose.\n\nThis classification is important as it helps in understanding the structure and function of these simple sugars, which serve as the building blocks for more complex carbohydrates. Monosaccharides can exist in linear or ring forms and are also categorized based on the position of the carbonyl group (aldoses or ketoses) and their ring structure (alpha or beta forms).
