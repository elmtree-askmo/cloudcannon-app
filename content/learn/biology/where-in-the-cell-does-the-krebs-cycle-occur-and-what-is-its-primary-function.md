    Where in the cell does the Krebs cycle occur, and what is its primary function?
answer: >-
    The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. This organelle is often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell because it is the site where cellular respiration takes place.\n\nThe primary function of the Krebs cycle is to process pyruvate, which is derived from glucose during glycolysis, into carbon dioxide while transferring energy to electron carriers such as NADH and FADH2. These carriers then play a crucial role in the subsequent stage of cellular respiration, the electron transport chain, where the majority of ATP is produced. The overall reaction of the Krebs cycle contributes to the cell's energy metabolism by generating high-energy molecules that are essential for ATP production.\n\nIn summary, the Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondria and its primary function is to convert pyruvate into carbon dioxide while transferring energy to electron carriers for ATP production.
