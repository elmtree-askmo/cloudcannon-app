    What distinguishes a scientific theory from a hypothesis?
answer: >-
    A scientific theory and a hypothesis are both essential components of the scientific method, but they serve different purposes and are distinguished by their levels of support and scope.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - A **hypothesis** is a specific, testable prediction about the relationship between variables. It is often formulated based on observations and existing knowledge. For example, a hypothesis might state, "If plants are given more sunlight, then they will grow taller."\n   - A **scientific theory**, on the other hand, is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence. Theories are broader in scope and have been repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation. Examples include the theory of evolution and cell theory.\n\n2. **Level of Evidence**:\n   - A hypothesis is typically an initial step in the scientific process, requiring testing through experiments and observations to determine its validity. It can be supported or refuted based on experimental results.\n   - A scientific theory is supported by a substantial amount of evidence gathered from multiple studies and experiments over time. It integrates and explains a wide range of observations and has withstood rigorous testing.\n\n3. **Scope**:\n   - Hypotheses are often narrow in focus, addressing specific questions or predictions.\n   - Theories encompass broader concepts and can explain a variety of phenomena. They can also generate new hypotheses for further testing.\n\n4. **Evolution of Ideas**:\n   - A hypothesis can evolve into a theory if it is consistently supported by evidence from various experiments and observations. Over time, as more data accumulates and hypotheses are tested, they can contribute to the establishment of a scientific theory.\n\nIn summary, while a hypothesis is a starting point for investigation, a scientific theory represents a comprehensive understanding of a natural phenomenon, supported by extensive evidence and research.
