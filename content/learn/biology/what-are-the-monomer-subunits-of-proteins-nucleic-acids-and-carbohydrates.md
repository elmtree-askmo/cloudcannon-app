    What are the monomer subunits of proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates?
answer: >-
    The monomer subunits of the three major classes of biomolecules are as follows:\n\n1. **Proteins**: The monomer subunit of proteins is the **amino acid**. There are 20 different amino acids that can be combined in various sequences to form proteins. The specific sequence of amino acids determines the protein's structure and function, as they are linked together by **peptide bonds** during the process of polymerization.\n\n2. **Nucleic Acids**: The monomer subunit of nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA) is the **nucleotide**. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA), and a phosphate group. Nucleotides are linked together by **phosphodiester bonds** to form the nucleic acid polymers, which encode genetic information.\n\n3. **Carbohydrates**: The monomer subunit of carbohydrates is the **monosaccharide**. Common examples include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Monosaccharides can be linked together through **glycosidic bonds** to form disaccharides (like sucrose and lactose) and polysaccharides (like starch and cellulose), which serve various functions including energy storage and structural support.\n\nIn summary, the monomer subunits are:\n- **Proteins**: Amino acids\n- **Nucleic Acids**: Nucleotides\n- **Carbohydrates**: Monosaccharides\n\nEach type of monomer plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the respective biomolecule.
