    What is the typical size range of cells that can be observed with the naked eye?
answer: >-
    Cells are generally microscopic and cannot be observed with the naked eye. The typical size range of most cells, including animal and plant cells, is between 1 to 100 micrometers (μm), which is equivalent to 0.001 to 0.1 millimeters (mm). The smallest object that the human eye can typically see is about 0.05 mm (50 μm), which is still larger than most individual cells.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions in the case of certain large single-celled organisms. For example, the ostrich egg is the largest single cell in the animal kingdom, measuring about six inches long and weighing around three pounds. Additionally, some single-celled organisms, like certain species of amoeba, can grow large enough to be visible without a microscope; an average amoeba can measure around 700 micrometers (0.7 mm).\n\nIn summary, while most cells require a microscope for observation, some exceptionally large single-celled organisms can be seen with the naked eye, but these are not representative of the typical cell size range.
