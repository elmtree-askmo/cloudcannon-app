    Describe the difference between autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant disorders.
answer: >-
    Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant disorders are two distinct patterns of genetic inheritance that determine how certain traits or genetic diseases are passed from parents to offspring.\n\n### Autosomal Recessive Disorders\nIn autosomal recessive disorders, an individual must inherit two copies of a mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder. This means that both alleles must be recessive for the trait to manifest. Individuals who have only one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygous) are considered carriers and typically do not show symptoms of the disorder. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders include:\n\n- **Cystic Fibrosis**: Caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to severe respiratory and digestive issues.\n- **Sickle Cell Disease**: Resulting from a mutation in the HBB gene, which affects hemoglobin and can cause pain and other complications.\n\n### Autosomal Dominant Disorders\nIn contrast, autosomal dominant disorders require only one copy of a mutated gene for the disorder to manifest. An individual can be either homozygous (having two copies of the dominant allele) or heterozygous (having one copy of the dominant allele) to express the trait. This means that if one parent carries the dominant allele, there is a 50% chance of passing the disorder to their offspring. Examples of autosomal dominant disorders include:\n\n- **Huntington's Disease**: A neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in mid-adulthood, caused by a mutation in the HTT gene.\n- **Marfan Syndrome**: A connective tissue disorder that can affect the heart, eyes, and skeleton, caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Inheritance Requirement**: \n  - Autosomal Recessive: Two copies of the mutated gene (homozygous).\n  - Autosomal Dominant: One copy of the mutated gene (heterozygous or homozygous).\n  \n- **Carrier Status**: \n  - Autosomal Recessive: Carriers do not exhibit symptoms.\n  - Autosomal Dominant: Individuals with the dominant allele exhibit symptoms.\n\n- **Risk of Transmission**: \n  - Autosomal Recessive: Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected.\n  - Autosomal Dominant: One affected parent has a 50% chance of passing the disorder to each child.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for genetic counseling and assessing the risk of genetic diseases in families.
