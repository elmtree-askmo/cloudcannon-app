    What is passive transport and how does it differ from active transport in terms of energy requirements?
answer: >-
    Passive transport is the movement of substances across a cell membrane without the use of energy. This process occurs along the concentration gradient, meaning substances move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. Examples of passive transport include simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. In facilitated diffusion, transport proteins assist ions and polar molecules in crossing the membrane more efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, active transport is the process of moving molecules across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, which requires energy, typically in the form of ATP. This energy is necessary because active transport moves substances from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration, which is contrary to the natural tendency of molecules to diffuse.\n\nTo summarize the key differences in energy requirements:\n\n- **Passive Transport**: No energy is required; substances move along their concentration gradient (from high to low concentration).\n- **Active Transport**: Energy is required; substances move against their concentration gradient (from low to high concentration).\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring that cells can regulate their internal environments effectively.
