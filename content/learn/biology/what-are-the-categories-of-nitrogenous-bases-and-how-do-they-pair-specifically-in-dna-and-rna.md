    What are the categories of nitrogenous bases, and how do they pair specifically in DNA and RNA?
answer: >-
    Nitrogenous bases are essential components of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. These bases are categorized into two main groups: purines and pyrimidines.\n\n### Categories of Nitrogenous Bases\n\n1. **Purines**: These are characterized by a double-ring structure. The purines in nucleic acids are:\n   - **Adenine (A)**\n   - **Guanine (G)**\n\n2. **Pyrimidines**: These have a single-ring structure. The pyrimidines in nucleic acids are:\n   - **Cytosine (C)**\n   - **Thymine (T)** (found only in DNA)\n   - **Uracil (U)** (found only in RNA, replacing thymine)\n\n### Base Pairing Specifics\n\nThe pairing of nitrogenous bases is crucial for the structure and function of DNA and RNA. The specific base pairing rules are as follows:\n\n- **In DNA**:\n  - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds.\n  - Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G) through three hydrogen bonds.\n\n- **In RNA**:\n  - Adenine (A) pairs with Uracil (U) instead of thymine.\n  - Cytosine (C) still pairs with Guanine (G) as in DNA.\n\n### Summary of Base Pairing Rules\n\n- **DNA Base Pairing**:\n  - A ↔ T\n  - C ↔ G\n\n- **RNA Base Pairing**:\n  - A ↔ U\n  - C ↔ G\n\nThis complementary base pairing is fundamental for the stability of the nucleic acid structures and is essential for processes such as DNA replication and RNA transcription. The specificity of these pairings ensures that genetic information is accurately copied and transmitted.
