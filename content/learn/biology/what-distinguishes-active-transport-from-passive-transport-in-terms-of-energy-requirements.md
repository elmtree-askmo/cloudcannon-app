    What distinguishes active transport from passive transport in terms of energy requirements?
answer: >-
    Active transport and passive transport are two distinct mechanisms by which substances move across cell membranes, and they differ primarily in their energy requirements and the direction of movement relative to concentration gradients.\n\n### Passive Transport\n- **Energy Requirement**: Passive transport does not require any energy input from the cell. Instead, it relies on the natural kinetic energy of molecules.\n- **Direction of Movement**: Substances move down their concentration gradient, meaning they move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. This process occurs spontaneously.\n- **Types of Passive Transport**:\n  - **Simple Diffusion**: Movement of small nonpolar molecules (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide) directly through the lipid bilayer.\n  - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Movement of ions and polar molecules through specific transport proteins (channels or carriers) without energy expenditure.\n  - **Osmosis**: The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.\n\n### Active Transport\n- **Energy Requirement**: Active transport requires energy, typically in the form of ATP. This energy is necessary to move substances against their concentration gradient.\n- **Direction of Movement**: Substances move from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration, which is not a spontaneous process and requires cellular energy.\n- **Examples of Active Transport**:\n  - **Na⁺-K⁺ Pump**: This pump moves 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell against their respective concentration gradients, using one molecule of ATP.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key distinction between active and passive transport lies in energy requirements: passive transport is energy-free and moves substances down their concentration gradient, while active transport requires energy to move substances against their gradient. This fundamental difference is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the internal environment of cells.
