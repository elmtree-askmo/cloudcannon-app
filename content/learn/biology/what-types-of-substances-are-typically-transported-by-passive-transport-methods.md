    What types of substances are typically transported by passive transport methods?
answer: >-
    Passive transport methods allow substances to move across cell membranes without the expenditure of energy, relying instead on the concentration gradient. The types of substances typically transported by passive transport methods include:\n\n1. **Simple Diffusion**:\n   - **Gases**: Oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) can diffuse directly through the lipid bilayer due to their small size and nonpolar nature.\n   - **Small Lipids**: Nonpolar molecules like steroid hormones can also pass through the membrane easily.\n   - **Small Polar Molecules**: Some small polar molecules, such as water, can diffuse through the membrane, although they may also utilize specific channels.\n\n2. **Facilitated Diffusion**:\n   - **Ions**: Charged particles such as sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), and chloride (Cl⁻) require channel proteins to cross the hydrophobic lipid bilayer.\n   - **Polar Molecules**: Larger polar molecules, such as glucose, are transported via carrier proteins that bind to the molecule and facilitate its passage across the membrane.\n\n3. **Osmosis**:\n   - **Water**: The passive movement of water molecules occurs either directly through the lipid bilayer or through specialized water channels called aquaporins.\n\nIn summary, passive transport typically involves the movement of gases, small lipids, small polar molecules, ions, and water, all moving down their concentration gradients without the need for energy input.
