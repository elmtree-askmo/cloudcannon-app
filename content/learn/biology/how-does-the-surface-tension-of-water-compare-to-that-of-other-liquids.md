    How does the surface tension of water compare to that of other liquids?
answer: >-
    The surface tension of water is notably higher than that of most other liquids, primarily due to its polar nature and the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules. At 20 °C (68 °F), water has a surface tension of approximately 72.8 mN/m (or 0.07275 joule per square meter). This high surface tension allows water to exhibit unique behaviors, such as enabling small objects, like a paper clip, to float on its surface despite being denser than water.\n\nIn comparison to other liquids, water's surface tension is relatively high. For instance, organic liquids such as benzene and various alcohols have lower surface tensions, typically ranging from about 20 to 30 mN/m. On the other hand, mercury, a liquid metal, has an exceptionally high surface tension of nearly 500 mN/m, making it the liquid with the highest known surface tension.\n\nThe phenomenon of surface tension arises from the cohesive forces between liquid molecules at the surface, which are more strongly attracted to each other than to the air above. This results in the surface behaving like a stretched elastic sheet, minimizing the surface area. As temperature increases, the surface tension of liquids generally decreases due to the increased kinetic energy of the molecules, which disrupts the intermolecular forces.\n\nIn summary, water's surface tension is among the highest for common liquids, surpassed only by mercury, and is significantly greater than that of many organic solvents. This property plays a crucial role in various biological and physical processes, including the ability of certain insects to walk on water and the behavior of water droplets.
