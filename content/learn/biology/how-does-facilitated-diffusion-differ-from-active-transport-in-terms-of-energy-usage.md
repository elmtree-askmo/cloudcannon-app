    How does facilitated diffusion differ from active transport in terms of energy usage?
answer: >-
    Facilitated diffusion and active transport are two distinct mechanisms of membrane transport that differ primarily in their energy requirements and the direction of movement relative to concentration gradients.\n\n### Facilitated Diffusion\n- **Energy Usage**: Facilitated diffusion does not require energy. It is a passive transport process where substances move down their concentration gradient, from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n- **Mechanism**: This process involves transport proteins, such as channels and carriers, that help ions and polar molecules cross the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Since these molecules cannot easily diffuse through the membrane due to their polarity or charge, the transport proteins provide a pathway for their movement.\n\n### Active Transport\n- **Energy Usage**: Active transport requires energy, typically in the form of ATP. This energy is necessary to move substances against their concentration gradient, from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.\n- **Mechanism**: Active transport is mediated by specific transport proteins known as pumps. A well-known example is the sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) pump, which moves sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, both against their respective concentration gradients. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell function.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Energy Requirement**: \n  - Facilitated Diffusion: No energy required (passive).\n  - Active Transport: Energy required (active).\n  \n- **Direction of Movement**: \n  - Facilitated Diffusion: Moves with the concentration gradient (high to low).\n  - Active Transport: Moves against the concentration gradient (low to high).\n\nIn conclusion, facilitated diffusion is a passive process that allows substances to move down their concentration gradient without energy, while active transport is an energy-dependent process that moves substances against their concentration gradient.
