    What is the role of dipeptidases in the final stages of protein digestion?
answer: >-
    Dipeptidases play a crucial role in the final stages of protein digestion by specifically hydrolyzing dipeptides into two free amino acids. These enzymes are located on the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, which is the lining of the small intestine. \n\nDuring protein digestion, proteins are initially broken down into polypeptides by endopeptidases (such as trypsin and pepsin) and then further processed by exopeptidases, which cleave terminal amino acids. However, the resulting dipeptides still need to be converted into absorbable unitsâ€”individual amino acids. This is where dipeptidases come into play.\n\nBy breaking down dipeptides, dipeptidases ensure that amino acids are available for absorption into the bloodstream. This process is essential because free amino acids are necessary for various bodily functions, including protein synthesis and other metabolic processes. The efficient action of dipeptidases facilitates the absorption of these amino acids, allowing the body to utilize them effectively.\n\nIn summary, dipeptidases are vital for completing protein digestion by converting dipeptides into free amino acids, which can then be absorbed and used by the body.
