    How does passive transport differ from active transport in terms of energy requirements?
answer: >-
    Passive transport and active transport are two fundamental mechanisms by which substances move across cell membranes, and they differ significantly in terms of energy requirements and the direction of movement relative to concentration gradients.\n\n### Passive Transport\n- **Energy Requirement**: Passive transport does not require any energy input from the cell. Instead, it relies on the natural kinetic energy of molecules.\n- **Direction of Movement**: Substances move down their concentration gradient, meaning they move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. This process continues until equilibrium is reached.\n- **Types of Passive Transport**:\n  - **Simple Diffusion**: Movement of small nonpolar molecules (e.g., O2, CO2) directly through the lipid bilayer.\n  - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Movement of ions and polar molecules through specific transport proteins (channels or carriers) without energy expenditure.\n  - **Osmosis**: The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.\n\n### Active Transport\n- **Energy Requirement**: Active transport requires energy, typically in the form of ATP, to move substances against their concentration gradient.\n- **Direction of Movement**: Substances move from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration, which is contrary to the natural flow of diffusion.\n- **Types of Active Transport**:\n  - **Pumps**: Transport proteins that use energy to move ions or molecules against their gradient. A well-known example is the Na⁺-K⁺ pump, which moves 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell using one molecule of ATP.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the key difference between passive and active transport lies in energy requirements and the direction of movement:\n- **Passive Transport**: No energy required; movement is with the concentration gradient (high to low).\n- **Active Transport**: Energy required; movement is against the concentration gradient (low to high).\n\nThis distinction is crucial for understanding how cells maintain homeostasis and regulate the internal environment.
