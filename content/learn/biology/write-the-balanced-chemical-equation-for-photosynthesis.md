    Write the balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis.
answer: >-
    The balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n$$\n6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2\n$$\n\nIn this process, carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere and water (H₂O) from the soil are converted into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂) using light energy, primarily captured by chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of plant cells. This transformation is fundamental to the carbon cycle and is essential for providing energy to most ecosystems on Earth.
