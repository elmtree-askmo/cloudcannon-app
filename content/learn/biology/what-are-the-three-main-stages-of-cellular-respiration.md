    What are the three main stages of cellular respiration?
answer: >-
    The three main stages of cellular respiration are:\n\n1. **Glycolysis**: This stage occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process produces a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and does not require oxygen (anaerobic).\n\n2. **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: This stage takes place in the mitochondria. The pyruvate produced in glycolysis is further broken down, releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) as a waste product. The Krebs cycle also transfers energy to electron carriers, such as NADH and FADH₂, which are essential for the next stage.\n\n3. **Electron Transport Chain**: This final stage occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, electrons from the electron carriers (NADH and FADH₂) are transferred through a series of proteins. This process generates a large amount of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, and water (H₂O) is produced as a byproduct when electrons combine with oxygen.\n\nOverall, cellular respiration converts glucose and oxygen into energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water, as summarized by the equation:\n\n$$\nC_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + ATP\n$$\n\nThis process is vital for all living organisms as it provides the energy necessary for various cellular functions.
