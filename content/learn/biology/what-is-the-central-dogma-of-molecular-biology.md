    What is the central dogma of molecular biology?
answer: >-
    The central dogma of molecular biology is a fundamental framework that describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. It outlines the process by which genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA and then translated into proteins. Specifically, the central dogma can be summarized in three main steps:\n\n1. **Transcription**: The process begins with the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). During this step, the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into a complementary RNA sequence. This occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells.\n\n2. **Translation**: The mRNA then undergoes translation, where ribosomes read the mRNA sequence and synthesize a corresponding polypeptide chain (protein) based on the sequence of codons in the mRNA. This process involves transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules that bring the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome.\n\n3. **Protein Folding and Function**: Once synthesized, the polypeptide chain folds into a specific three-dimensional structure, which is crucial for its function as a protein. Proteins perform a wide range of functions in the cell, including catalyzing biochemical reactions, providing structural support, and regulating cellular processes.\n\nThis flow of information is often summarized as:\n$$\n\text{DNA} \xrightarrow{\text{Transcription}} \text{RNA} \xrightarrow{\text{Translation}} \text{Protein}\n$$\n\nUnderstanding the central dogma is essential for grasping how genetic information is expressed and utilized in cells, and it serves as a foundation for many concepts in genetics and molecular biology.
