    Where are peripheral proteins located in the plasma membrane, and what is their primary function?
answer: >-
    Peripheral proteins are located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane, either attached to integral proteins or directly to the phospholipid bilayer. They do not penetrate the membrane but are associated with its outer or inner surfaces.\n\nThe primary functions of peripheral proteins include:\n\n1. **Signaling**: They play a crucial role in cell signaling pathways by acting as receptors or by interacting with signaling molecules.\n2. **Structural Support**: Peripheral proteins help maintain the cell's shape and structure by anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\n3. **Cell Recognition**: They can be involved in cell recognition processes, often in conjunction with glycoproteins and glycolipids, facilitating communication between cells.\n\nOverall, peripheral proteins contribute significantly to the dynamic functions of the plasma membrane, supporting various cellular activities.
