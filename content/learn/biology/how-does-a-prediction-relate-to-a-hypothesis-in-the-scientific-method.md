    How does a prediction relate to a hypothesis in the scientific method?
answer: >-
    In the scientific method, a prediction is closely related to a hypothesis, serving as a specific forecast of the expected outcomes if the hypothesis is correct. \n\n1. **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a tentative, testable explanation for a specific observation or phenomenon. It is formulated based on prior knowledge, observations, and background research. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that "increased sunlight exposure leads to greater plant growth."\n\n2. **Prediction**: A prediction is derived from the hypothesis and outlines what the researcher expects to observe if the hypothesis is validated. It is a specific statement that forecasts the outcome of an experiment. Continuing with the previous example, the prediction might be, "If plants are exposed to more sunlight, then they will grow at least 20% taller than those kept in the shade after four weeks."\n\nIn summary, the hypothesis provides a broader explanation for an observation, while the prediction specifies the expected results of testing that hypothesis. The hypothesis guides the research, and the prediction helps in designing the experiment to test the hypothesis. This relationship is crucial in the scientific method, as it allows researchers to formulate experiments that can either support or refute their initial hypotheses.
