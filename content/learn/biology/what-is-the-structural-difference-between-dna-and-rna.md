    What is the structural difference between DNA and RNA?
answer: >-
    The structural differences between DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are significant and can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Strands**:\n   - **DNA**: Typically double-stranded, forming a double helix structure. The two strands are complementary and run in opposite directions (antiparallel).\n   - **RNA**: Usually single-stranded, although it can form secondary structures through intramolecular base pairing.\n\n2. **Sugar Component**:\n   - **DNA**: Contains deoxyribose, which lacks an -OH group on the 2' carbon (it has a hydrogen atom instead).\n   - **RNA**: Contains ribose, which has an -OH group on the 2' carbon, making it more reactive than DNA.\n\n3. **Nitrogenous Bases**:\n   - **DNA**: Contains the bases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n   - **RNA**: Contains adenine (A), uracil (U) (which replaces thymine), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n\n4. **Stability**:\n   - **DNA**: More stable due to its double-stranded structure and the presence of deoxyribose, which is less reactive.\n   - **RNA**: More reactive and less stable, primarily because of the ribose sugar and its single-stranded nature.\n\n5. **Function**:\n   - **DNA**: Serves as the genetic blueprint for organisms, storing and transmitting genetic information.\n   - **RNA**: Plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and gene expression, acting as a messenger (mRNA), a component of ribosomes (rRNA), and a transfer molecule (tRNA).\n\nThese structural differences are fundamental to the distinct roles that DNA and RNA play in biological systems, particularly in the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein.
