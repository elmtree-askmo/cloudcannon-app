    What is the source organism of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and what are its fluorescence characteristics?
answer: >-
    Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is a protein that exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet or blue light. It was originally discovered in the jellyfish *Aequorea victoria*. The fluorescence characteristics of GFP are notable; it absorbs light primarily in the blue to ultraviolet range and emits light in the green spectrum, typically around 509 nanometers.\n\nGFP has become a crucial tool in molecular and cellular biology, allowing researchers to visualize gene expression and protein localization in live cells. By creating fusion proteins with GFP, scientists can track the dynamics of proteins in real time, providing insights into cellular processes.\n\nThe fluorescence mechanism of GFP involves the absorption of light at a specific wavelength, followed by the emission of light at a longer wavelength, a process known as fluorescence. This property makes GFP particularly useful in various microscopy techniques, including fluorescence microscopy, where it can be used to label specific cellular components for visualization.\n\nIn summary, GFP is derived from the jellyfish *Aequorea victoria* and is characterized by its ability to fluoresce bright green when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, making it an invaluable tool in biological research.
