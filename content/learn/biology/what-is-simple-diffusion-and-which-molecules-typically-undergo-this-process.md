    What is simple diffusion and which molecules typically undergo this process?
answer: >-
    Simple diffusion is a passive transport process in which molecules move directly across the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane along their concentration gradient, from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process does not require any energy input, making it a fundamental mechanism for the movement of certain substances into and out of cells.\n\nTypically, the molecules that undergo simple diffusion include:\n\n1. **Gases**: Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are prime examples. These small, nonpolar molecules can easily pass through the lipid bilayer without assistance.\n2. **Small Lipids**: Lipid-soluble substances, such as steroid hormones, can diffuse through the membrane due to their hydrophobic nature.\n3. **Very Small Polar Molecules**: Water (H2O) is a notable example, although it can also pass through specialized channels called aquaporins.\n\nThe key characteristics of simple diffusion include:\n- Movement occurs down the concentration gradient.\n- The process continues until equilibrium is reached, meaning the concentration of the substance is equal on both sides of the membrane.\n- It is selective for small, nonpolar molecules and very small polar molecules, as larger or charged molecules typically require facilitated diffusion through transport proteins.\n\nIn summary, simple diffusion is an essential process for the transport of specific molecules across cell membranes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function.
