    What are the main differences between mitosis and meiosis?
answer: >-
    The main differences between mitosis and meiosis can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Purpose\n- **Mitosis**: The primary purpose of mitosis is to enable growth, development, and repair in multicellular organisms. It results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell (diploid).\n- **Meiosis**: The main purpose of meiosis is to produce gametes (sperm and eggs) for sexual reproduction. It results in four genetically diverse gametes, each with half the chromosome number of the parent cell (haploid).\n\n### Number of Divisions\n- **Mitosis**: Involves a single division, resulting in two daughter cells.\n- **Meiosis**: Consists of two consecutive divisions, known as meiosis I and meiosis II, leading to four daughter cells.\n\n### Stages\n- **Mitosis**: The stages include prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis.\n- **Meiosis**: The stages are divided into two rounds:\n  - **Meiosis I**: Includes prophase I (where crossing over occurs), metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, and cytokinesis.\n  - **Meiosis II**: Similar to mitosis, includes prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II, and cytokinesis.\n\n### Genetic Variation\n- **Mitosis**: Produces daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, maintaining the same genetic material.\n- **Meiosis**: Introduces genetic diversity through processes such as:\n  - **Crossing Over**: Occurs during prophase I, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material.\n  - **Independent Assortment**: The random distribution of maternal and paternal chromosomes into gametes.\n\n### Chromosome Separation\n- **Mitosis**: Sister chromatids are separated during anaphase.\n- **Meiosis**: \n  - In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated.\n  - In meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated.\n\n### Gametogenesis\n- **Mitosis**: Not directly involved in gamete formation.\n- **Meiosis**: Specifically involved in gametogenesis:\n  - **Spermatogenesis**: Results in four functional sperm cells.\n  - **Oogenesis**: Typically results in one functional egg cell and polar bodies.\n\nIn summary, while both mitosis and meiosis are forms of cell division, they serve different purposes, involve different processes, and result in different types of cells. Mitosis is essential for growth and repair, producing identical cells, whereas meiosis is crucial for sexual reproduction, generating genetic diversity through gametes.
