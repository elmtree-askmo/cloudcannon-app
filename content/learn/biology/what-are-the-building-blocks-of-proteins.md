    What are the building blocks of proteins?
answer: >-
    The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Amino acids are organic compounds characterized by a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (-NHâ‚‚), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a variable R group (side chain) that determines the specific properties of each amino acid. \n\nThere are 20 different amino acids that can combine in various sequences to form proteins. The unique sequence of amino acids in a protein, known as its primary structure, is crucial because it dictates the protein's overall structure and function. The interactions between the amino acids, including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions, lead to the formation of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, which are essential for the protein's biological activity.\n\nIn summary, amino acids are the fundamental units that link together through peptide bonds to create proteins, which play vital roles in various biological processes, including enzymatic functions, transport, and structural support in tissues.
