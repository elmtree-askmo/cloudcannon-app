    What are the characteristics of substances that can be transported via simple diffusion?
answer: >-
    The characteristics of substances that can be transported via simple diffusion include:\n\n1. **Size**: Simple diffusion typically involves small molecules. Substances that can diffuse easily through the lipid bilayer are generally small in size, such as gases (e.g., oxygen and carbon dioxide) and small lipids.\n\n2. **Polarity**: Nonpolar molecules can pass through the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer more readily than polar molecules. Therefore, simple diffusion is most effective for nonpolar substances. Small polar molecules, like water, can also diffuse but to a lesser extent compared to nonpolar molecules.\n\n3. **Concentration Gradient**: Simple diffusion occurs along the concentration gradient, meaning substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process does not require energy, making it a passive transport method.\n\n4. **Hydrophobic Nature**: The hydrophobic barrier of cell membranes allows nonpolar molecules to diffuse freely, while polar molecules and ions typically require facilitated diffusion through specific transport proteins.\n\nIn summary, substances that can be transported via simple diffusion are generally small, nonpolar, and move along their concentration gradient without the need for energy or transport proteins. Examples include oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and small lipids.
