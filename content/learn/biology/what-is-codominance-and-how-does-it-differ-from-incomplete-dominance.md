    Codominance and incomplete dominance are genetic inheritance patterns demonstrating how alleles interact in heterozygotes, with codominance showing both traits distinctly, and incomplete dominance resulting in a blended phenotype.

    What is codominance and how does it differ from incomplete dominance?
answer: >-
    Codominance and incomplete dominance are two distinct patterns of genetic inheritance that illustrate how alleles interact in heterozygous individuals.\n\n**Codominance** occurs when both alleles at a gene locus are fully expressed in the phenotype of a heterozygote. This means that neither allele is dominant or recessive, and the traits associated with both alleles are visible simultaneously. A classic example of codominance is found in the human ABO blood group system, where individuals with type AB blood express both A and B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells. Another example is seen in the MN blood group system, where individuals can express both M and N antigens. In animals, speckled chickens exhibit both black and white feathers, and roan cattle display both red and white hair.\n\nIn contrast, **incomplete dominance** occurs when the phenotype of a heterozygote is an intermediate blend of the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. In this case, one allele does not completely mask the effect of the other, resulting in a new phenotype that is distinct from both parental traits. For instance, in certain flowering plants like Camellia, a cross between red and white flowers may produce offspring with pink flowers, which is an intermediate phenotype.\n\nTo summarize the key differences:\n- In codominance, both alleles are expressed equally and distinctly in the phenotype (e.g., AB blood type).\n- In incomplete dominance, the phenotype is a blend of the two alleles (e.g., pink flowers from red and white parents).\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for grasping the complexities of genetic inheritance and how traits are passed from parents to offspring.
