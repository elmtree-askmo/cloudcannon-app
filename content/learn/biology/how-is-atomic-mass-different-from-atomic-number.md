    How is atomic mass different from atomic number?
answer: >-
    Atomic mass and atomic number are two fundamental concepts in chemistry that describe different properties of an atom.\n\n1. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number (symbol Z) is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. This number is crucial because it determines the identity of the element and its position in the periodic table. In a neutral atom, the atomic number also equals the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus. For example, carbon has an atomic number of 6, meaning it has 6 protons and, in a neutral state, 6 electrons.\n\n2. **Atomic Mass**: Atomic mass, often referred to as atomic weight, is a measure of the total mass of an atom, which includes the mass of protons, neutrons, and a negligible contribution from electrons. It is typically expressed in atomic mass units (amu) and is calculated as a weighted average of the masses of an element's isotopes based on their natural abundance. For instance, the atomic mass of carbon is approximately 12.01 amu, reflecting the presence of both carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopes.\n\n### Key Differences:\n- **Definition**: \n  - Atomic number is the count of protons in the nucleus.\n  - Atomic mass is the weighted average mass of an atom's isotopes.\n\n- **Value**: \n  - The atomic number is always a whole number and is unique to each element.\n  - The atomic mass can be a decimal due to the averaging of isotopes.\n\n- **Role in the Periodic Table**: \n  - The atomic number is used to organize elements in the periodic table.\n  - Atomic mass provides information about the mass of the element but does not affect its position in the periodic table.\n\nIn summary, while the atomic number identifies the element and its properties, the atomic mass provides insight into the mass characteristics of the element's isotopes.
