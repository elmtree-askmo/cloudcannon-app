    What are the two main stages of photosynthesis, and where do they occur?
answer: >-
    Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions). \n\n1. **Light-Dependent Reactions**: \n   - **Location**: These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.\n   - **Process**: During this stage, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which energizes electrons. Water molecules are split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The energy from the electrons is used to produce ATP and NADPH, which are energy carriers.\n\n2. **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)**:\n   - **Location**: This stage takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts.\n   - **Process**: The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into glucose through a series of reactions. This process does not require light directly, hence the name "light-independent."\n\nOverall, photosynthesis is crucial for converting solar energy into chemical energy, which sustains life on Earth by providing food and oxygen.
