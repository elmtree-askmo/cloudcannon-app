    How do mitosis and meiosis differ in terms of genetic outcomes?
answer: >-
    Mitosis and meiosis are two fundamental processes of cell division in eukaryotic organisms, and they differ significantly in terms of genetic outcomes. Here are the key differences:\n\n### 1. Purpose\n- **Mitosis**: The primary purpose of mitosis is to facilitate growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. It produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, maintaining the same chromosome number (diploid in most cases).\n- **Meiosis**: The main purpose of meiosis is to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) for sexual reproduction. This process results in four genetically diverse daughter cells, each with half the chromosome number of the parent cell (haploid).\n\n### 2. Number of Divisions\n- **Mitosis**: Involves a single round of cell division, resulting in two daughter cells.\n- **Meiosis**: Consists of two consecutive rounds of cell division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II), leading to four daughter cells.\n\n### 3. Genetic Variation\n- **Mitosis**: The daughter cells produced are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning there is no introduction of genetic variation.\n- **Meiosis**: Introduces genetic diversity through:\n  - **Crossing Over**: Occurs during prophase I, where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of genetic material, leading to new combinations of alleles.\n  - **Independent Assortment**: The random distribution of maternal and paternal chromosomes into gametes during metaphase I, which further increases genetic variation.\n\n### 4. Stages\n- **Mitosis**: The stages include prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis.\n- **Meiosis**: The stages are divided into two rounds:\n  - **Meiosis I**: Includes prophase I (where crossing over occurs), metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I, and cytokinesis.\n  - **Meiosis II**: Similar to mitosis, includes prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II, and cytokinesis.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, mitosis results in two genetically identical diploid cells, while meiosis results in four genetically diverse haploid gametes. This difference is crucial for the processes of growth and repair in organisms versus the generation of genetic diversity necessary for sexual reproduction.
