    Define tonicity and describe the effects of hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic solutions on cells.
answer: >-
    Tonicity is a term that describes the ability of a solution to influence the volume of a cell through the process of osmosis. It is determined by the relative concentrations of solutes in the solution compared to the inside of the cell. There are three primary types of tonicity: hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic.\n\n1. **Hypertonic Solutions**: A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. When an animal or plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cell to the area of higher solute concentration. This results in the cell losing water, causing it to shrink or crenate in the case of animal cells. In plant cells, the loss of water leads to a decrease in turgor pressure, which can cause wilting.\n\n2. **Hypotonic Solutions**: A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. When cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell, leading to an increase in cell volume. In animal cells, this can result in swelling and potentially bursting (lysis). In plant cells, the influx of water increases turgor pressure, which is beneficial for maintaining structural integrity.\n\n3. **Isotonic Solutions**: An isotonic solution has an equal solute concentration compared to the inside of the cell. In this case, there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell, maintaining equilibrium. Cells remain stable in isotonic solutions, which is crucial for their normal function.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts of tonicity is essential for various biological processes, including osmoregulation and the overall health of cells.
