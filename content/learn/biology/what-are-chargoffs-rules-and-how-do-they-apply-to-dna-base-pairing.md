    What are Chargoff’s rules, and how do they apply to DNA base pairing?
answer: >-
    Chargaff's rules are fundamental principles in molecular biology that describe the base composition of DNA. Specifically, these rules state that in any given DNA molecule, the amount of adenine (A) is equal to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) is equal to the amount of cytosine (C). This can be summarized as:\n\n- %A = %T\n- %G = %C\n\nThese relationships arise from the specific hydrogen bonding that occurs during complementary base pairing, where adenine pairs with thymine (or uracil in RNA) and guanine pairs with cytosine. This pairing is crucial for the stability and integrity of the DNA double helix structure.\n\nChargaff's rules are particularly useful for predicting the sequence of a complementary DNA strand. For example, if you know the percentage of adenine in a DNA sample, you can infer the percentage of thymine, and similarly for guanine and cytosine. This is important in various applications, including DNA sequencing and understanding genetic information.\n\nIn summary, Chargaff's rules highlight the complementary nature of DNA base pairing and provide a quantitative framework for understanding the relationships between the different nitrogenous bases in DNA.
