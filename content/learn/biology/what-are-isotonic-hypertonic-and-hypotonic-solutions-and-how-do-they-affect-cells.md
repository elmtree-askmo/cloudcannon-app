    What are isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions, and how do they affect cells?
answer: >-
    Isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions are terms used to describe the relative concentrations of solutes in a solution compared to another solution, typically in relation to cells. Understanding these concepts is crucial for comprehending how cells interact with their environment, particularly in terms of water movement and osmotic pressure.\n\n1. **Isotonic Solutions**: \n   - An isotonic solution has an equal solute concentration compared to the cytosol (the fluid inside the cell). \n   - In this scenario, there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell, meaning that water enters and exits at the same rate. \n   - This equilibrium helps maintain cell shape and function without causing swelling or shrinking.\n\n2. **Hypertonic Solutions**: \n   - A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration than the cytosol. \n   - When cells are placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cells to the area of higher solute concentration. \n   - This results in cell shrinkage or crenation, which can impair cellular function and viability.\n\n3. **Hypotonic Solutions**: \n   - A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration compared to the cytosol. \n   - In this case, water moves into the cells, as the cell's internal solute concentration is higher. \n   - This influx of water can lead to cell swelling and potentially bursting (lysis) if the osmotic pressure becomes too great.\n\n### Summary of Effects on Cells:\n- **Hypotonic Solutions**: Cells gain water, potentially leading to swelling or lysis.\n- **Hypertonic Solutions**: Cells lose water, leading to shrinkage.\n- **Isotonic Solutions**: No net water movement, maintaining cell equilibrium.\n\nThese concepts are essential for various biological processes, including osmoregulation, which is the process by which cells and organisms maintain fluid balance and concentration of solutes. Understanding tonicity is vital for applications in medicine, biology, and biochemistry, particularly in contexts such as intravenous fluid administration and cell culture.
