    What was the focus of Patrick Geddes' unrealized museum project?
answer: >-
    Patrick Geddes' unrealized museum project focused on presenting the history of early humanity, specifically the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages, through local antiquities. His vision included not only the display of these artifacts but also the use of reproductions, figures, friezes, and illustrated guides to enhance the educational experience. Geddes aimed to create a narrative that would reflect the historical and cultural significance of these periods, particularly in the context of the region's heritage.\n\nInvited to Jerusalem by the Zionist Commission in 1919, Geddes was also involved in planning the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus and served as a consultant for the Mandatory government of Jerusalem. His proposed museum was intended to serve as a means of cultural affirmation and education, aligning with the broader ideological goals of the Zionist movement during that period. This project illustrates how museums can act as sites of ideological confirmation, shaping public understanding of history and culture under colonial influences.
