    According to Tacitus, what were the British attitudes towards Roman taxation and conscription?
answer: >-
    According to Tacitus, the British attitudes towards Roman taxation and conscription were characterized by significant resentment and opposition. In his work "Agricola," particularly in chapter 13, Tacitus describes the Britons as viewing these impositions as symbols of subjugation and exploitation. This perception fueled resistance against Roman authority and underscored the tensions between the Roman occupiers and the native population.\n\nTacitus highlights that the imposition of taxes and the requirement for conscription were not merely administrative measures; they were seen as direct affronts to the autonomy and dignity of the Britons. The resentment towards these practices contributed to a broader atmosphere of resistance against Roman rule, indicating that the strategies employed by the Romans to control and integrate Britain often backfired, leading to increased hostility rather than acceptance.\n\nThis account suggests that while the Romans aimed to establish control through economic and military pressures, such strategies were met with significant pushback from the local populace, reflecting the complexities of cultural integration and the challenges faced by the Roman Empire in maintaining authority over conquered territories.
