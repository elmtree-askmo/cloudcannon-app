    Define dēmos and dēmokratia in the context of ancient Greek political systems.
answer: >-
    In the context of ancient Greek political systems, the terms 'dēmos' (δῆμος) and 'dēmokratia' (δημοκρατία) are foundational to understanding Athenian democracy.\n\n1. **Dēmos**: This term refers to the common people or the citizen body of ancient Athens. The dēmos was composed of male citizens who had the right to participate in the political process. They played a crucial role in governance, engaging in assemblies and elections, thereby influencing decisions that affected the city-state. The dēmos represented the collective will of the citizens, and their participation was essential for the functioning of the democratic system.\n\n2. **Dēmokratia**: Translated as "power of the people," dēmokratia encapsulates the essence of Athenian democracy. It signifies a political system where the authority of the government is derived from the collective will of the dēmos. In this system, all male citizens had equal political rights, which allowed them to participate directly in decision-making processes. This direct form of democracy was characterized by the assembly, where citizens gathered to discuss and vote on public matters.\n\nTogether, these concepts highlight the unique nature of Athenian democracy, where the power and authority of the state were rooted in the active participation of its citizens, contrasting with modern representative democracies where elected officials make decisions on behalf of the people.
