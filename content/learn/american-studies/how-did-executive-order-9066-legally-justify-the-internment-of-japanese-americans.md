answer: >-
    Executive Order 9066, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, legally justified the internment of Japanese Americans by authorizing the Secretary of War to designate military areas and remove individuals from those areas deemed a threat to national security. This order was a direct response to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the prevailing fears of espionage and sabotage by Japanese Americans, particularly in the context of World War II.\n\nThe government framed the internment as a necessary measure for national security, arguing that the relocation of Japanese Americans was essential to prevent potential acts of sabotage against the United States. This justification was rooted in wartime hysteria and racial prejudice, leading to the forced relocation of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens.\n\nThe legal basis for the internment was further examined in the Supreme Court case Korematsu v. United States, where the Court upheld the constitutionality of the internment orders. The decision raised significant concerns regarding racial discrimination and civil liberties, as it effectively sanctioned the internment based on race rather than individual evidence of disloyalty or threat.\n\nIn summary, Executive Order 9066 was justified under the guise of military necessity, but it has since been widely criticized as a violation of civil rights and an example of racial discrimination in American history. The internment experience has become a critical part of discussions on civil liberties, social justice, and the impact of government policies on cultural identity and family history within the Japanese American community.
