answer: >-
    In the Athenian Assembly, the voting procedures were designed to facilitate direct participation of citizens in the decision-making process. Here are the key aspects of the voting procedures in Athens:\n\n1. **Direct Participation**: All male citizens of Athens were allowed to participate in the Assembly (Ekklesia), where they could discuss and vote on various issues, including laws and policies.\n\n2. **Voting Methods**: Voting in the Assembly was typically conducted through a show of hands or by using pebbles (known as "psephoi"). For more significant decisions, such as ostracism, citizens would use pottery shards (ostraka) to cast their votes anonymously.\n\n3. **Quorum Requirement**: Major decisions required a quorum, ensuring that a significant portion of the citizenry was involved in the decision-making process. This was crucial for the legitimacy of the Assembly's decisions.\n\n4. **Ostracism**: This was a unique voting procedure where citizens could vote to exile a person they deemed a threat to democracy for ten years. This process involved writing the name of the individual on a piece of pottery, and if a sufficient number of votes were cast, the individual would be ostracized.\n\n5. **Sortition**: Many public officials were chosen by lot, which helped to prevent the concentration of power and allowed for broader participation among citizens.\n\nIn contrast, the voting procedures in Sparta were quite different due to its mixed constitution and the nature of its governance:\n\n1. **Assembly (Apella)**: The Spartan Assembly, known as the Apella, consisted of male citizens over the age of 30. However, the voting process was less direct than in Athens. The Apella would vote on proposals put forth by the Gerousia (Council of Elders) and had limited power compared to the Athenian Assembly.\n\n2. **Voting Method**: In Sparta, voting was often conducted by acclamation or by raising hands, but it lacked the secret ballot system that Athens employed. This could lead to more public pressure and influence on individual votes.\n\n3. **Role of the Gerousia**: The Gerousia, which included elders and two kings, held significant power in proposing legislation and decisions, meaning that the Assembly's role was more about ratifying decisions rather than actively shaping them.\n\n4. **Limited Citizen Participation**: While Spartan citizens had a voice in the Apella, the overall political structure was more oligarchic, with significant power concentrated in the hands of the Gerousia and the Ephors (overseers).\n\nIn summary, Athenian democracy emphasized direct citizen participation and secret voting methods, allowing for a more engaged populace in governance. In contrast, Spartan governance was characterized by a more oligarchic structure, with limited direct participation from citizens and a voting process that was less private and more influenced by the ruling elite.
