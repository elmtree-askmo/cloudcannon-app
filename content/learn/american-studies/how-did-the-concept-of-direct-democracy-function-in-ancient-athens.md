answer: >-
    The concept of direct democracy in ancient Athens functioned through a system known as demokratia, which emerged in the late 6th century BCE. This system allowed male citizens to participate directly in political decision-making, distinguishing it from modern representative democracies. Here are the key features and institutions that facilitated this direct form of governance:\n\n### Key Institutions of Athenian Democracy\n\n1. **Ekklesia (Assembly)**: The ekklesia was the central governing body where all eligible male citizens over the age of 20 could gather to discuss and vote on important issues, including laws, war, and foreign policy. Meetings were held on the Pnyx hill, allowing citizens to speak freely and express their opinions. The Assembly was sovereign, meaning it held ultimate authority in the political system.\n\n2. **Council of 500 (Boule)**: This council was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Assembly. Members were selected by lot, ensuring that a diverse group of citizens could participate in governance. The Boule played a crucial role in the daily administration of the city and acted as a check on the Assembly's decisions.\n\n3. **Law Courts**: Athenian democracy also included a system of law courts where citizens could participate as jurors. This allowed for direct involvement in the judicial process, reinforcing the principle of citizen engagement in governance.\n\n### Features of Athenian Direct Democracy\n\n- **Direct Participation**: Unlike modern representative democracies, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, Athenian democracy allowed citizens to vote directly on laws and policies. This direct involvement fostered a sense of civic responsibility and engagement among the populace.\n\n- **Lottery System**: Many public offices were filled through a lottery system, which emphasized equality among citizens and reduced the concentration of power in the hands of a few. This practice aimed to ensure that all citizens had an equal opportunity to participate in governance.\n\n- **Ostracism**: A unique feature of Athenian democracy was the practice of ostracism, where citizens could vote to exile individuals deemed a threat to the state. This served as a mechanism for the community to protect itself from potential tyranny.\n\n### Limitations of Athenian Democracy\n\nWhile Athenian democracy was revolutionary for its time, it had significant limitations. Only male citizens who were born in Athens and owned property could participate, excluding women, slaves, and foreigners from the political process. This exclusion highlights the inherent inequalities within the system, despite its democratic ideals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the direct democracy of ancient Athens was characterized by active citizen participation through institutions like the ekklesia, the Boule, and the law courts. This system laid the groundwork for modern democratic practices, emphasizing the importance of civic engagement and public debate, even as it grappled with significant limitations regarding who could participate in the political process.
