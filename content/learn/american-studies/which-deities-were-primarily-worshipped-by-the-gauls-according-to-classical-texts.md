    Which deities were primarily worshipped by the Gauls, according to classical texts?
answer: >-
    According to classical texts, the Gauls worshipped a variety of deities, with notable figures including:\n\n1. **Teutates**: Often associated with war and protection, Teutates was a significant god in the Gallic pantheon.\n2. **Esus**: A deity linked to agriculture and possibly associated with sacrifice, Esus was depicted in various inscriptions and accounts.\n3. **Taranis**: Recognized as a god of thunder, Taranis was often equated with the Roman god Jupiter, reflecting the syncretism between Celtic and Roman religious practices.\n4. **Epona**: The goddess of horses and fertility, Epona was particularly revered and later integrated into Roman worship.\n5. **Poeninus**: Another deity mentioned in classical sources, though less is known about his specific attributes.\n\nThese deities were often worshipped through rituals that included sacrifices, which were sometimes human, as noted by classical authors. The Celts also exhibited a tendency to equate their gods with Roman deities, a practice known as Interpretatio Romana, which complicates our understanding of their original attributes and significance. \n\nOverall, the worship of these deities reflects the complex spiritual landscape of the Gauls, as documented by sources such as Julius Caesar in "De Bello Gallico" and other classical writers.
