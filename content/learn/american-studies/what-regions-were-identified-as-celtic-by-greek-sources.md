    What regions were identified as Celtic by Greek sources?
answer: >-
    Greek sources identified several regions as Celtic, primarily through the use of the term "Keltoi" (Κελτοί). This term was used to describe various Celtic-speaking peoples inhabiting parts of Europe. Notable regions identified by Greek authors include:\n\n1. **Gaul (Gallia)**: This area corresponds to modern-day France and parts of Belgium. Greek and Roman authors frequently referred to the tribes in this region, such as the Arverni and the Helvetii.\n\n2. **The British Isles**: Greek sources also recognized Celtic tribes in what is now the United Kingdom and Ireland. The term "Celtae" was often used in Latin texts to refer to these groups.\n\n3. **The Danube Region**: Herodotus, in his "Histories," associated the Celts with the Danube River, indicating their presence in Central Europe.\n\n4. **Southern France**: Hecataeus of Miletus mentioned Celtic towns and trading centers, such as Narbon (modern Narbonne) and Massalia (modern Marseille), highlighting the sophistication of Celtic culture in this region.\n\n5. **Other Areas**: Greek authors also noted the presence of Celts in regions beyond Gaul, including parts of modern Switzerland and Austria, where various tribes like the Belgae were located.\n\nOverall, Greek sources contributed significantly to the understanding of Celtic regions, although their descriptions were often influenced by their own cultural perspectives and may not fully capture the diversity and complexity of Celtic identities.
