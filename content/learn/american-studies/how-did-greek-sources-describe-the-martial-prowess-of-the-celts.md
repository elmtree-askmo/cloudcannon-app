    How did Greek sources describe the martial prowess of the Celts?
answer: >-
    Greek sources provided various descriptions of the martial prowess of the Celts, often emphasizing their fierce and formidable nature in battle. Notable Greek historians such as Herodotus and later authors like Diodorus Siculus and Posidonius contributed to the understanding of Celtic warfare and their reputation as warriors.\n\n1. **Martial Characteristics**: Greek accounts frequently highlighted the Celts' bravery and combat skills. They were noted for their distinctive fighting style, which included the use of chariots and a variety of weapons such as long swords and shields. The Celts were often depicted as fierce and aggressive fighters, capable of engaging in both offensive and defensive warfare.\n\n2. **Cultural Distinctions**: Greek sources also pointed out the differences between Celtic and Greek military practices. The Celts were organized into tribal units, emphasizing individual valor and loyalty to their chieftains, contrasting with the more disciplined and structured Roman military organization. This tribal structure allowed for a more fluid and dynamic approach to warfare, which was often characterized by surprise attacks and rapid movements.\n\n3. **Ethnographic Descriptions**: The ethnographic descriptions provided by Greek authors often included observations about the Celts' behavior in battle, such as their tendency to fight naked or with minimal armor, which was seen as a display of bravery and ferocity. This portrayal contributed to the image of the Celts as wild and untamed warriors, further enhancing their reputation in the eyes of the Greeks.\n\n4. **Mercenary Roles**: Some Greek accounts, particularly those by Xenophon, noted the role of Celts as mercenaries in Greek warfare. This involvement showcased their martial skills and adaptability, as they fought alongside Greek city-states and were recognized for their effectiveness in combat.\n\nOverall, Greek sources painted a picture of the Celts as formidable warriors whose martial prowess was both respected and feared by their contemporaries. These descriptions have had a lasting impact on the historical understanding of Celtic identity and their military capabilities.
