    What role did Druids play in Celtic society, and how were they perceived by the Romans?
answer: >-
    Druids played a significant and multifaceted role in Celtic society, serving as religious leaders, educators, judges, and custodians of knowledge. They were integral to the spiritual and social fabric of the Celts, conducting rituals, sacrifices, and ceremonies that were believed to connect the community with the divine and the natural world. Druids were often seen as intermediaries between the gods and the people, performing offerings and divination practices to seek guidance and favor from the deities. Their deep understanding of nature and the cosmos was central to their authority, and they were exempt from military service, allowing them to focus on their religious and educational duties.\n\nJulius Caesar's accounts in "De Bello Gallico" provide some of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the Druids, although these accounts must be approached with caution due to Caesar's political motivations and the propagandistic nature of his writings. He characterized the Druids as a distinct and influential class within Gallic society, equating them with divine worship and emphasizing their roles as judges and educators. However, it is important to note that Caesar's perspective was shaped by his own biases and the context of his military campaigns against the Celts, which may have influenced his portrayal of them as both noble and barbaric.\n\nThe Romans generally perceived the Druids with a mix of fascination and disdain. They viewed them as a threat to Roman order and authority, particularly due to their influence over the Celtic tribes and their practices, which included human sacrificesâ€”an aspect that the Romans found particularly abhorrent. This perception contributed to the Roman efforts to suppress Druidic practices during their conquests, leading to the decline of Druidism as Roman influence expanded across Celtic territories.\n\nIn summary, Druids were central figures in Celtic society, embodying religious, educational, and judicial roles, while their portrayal by the Romans was complex, reflecting both admiration and apprehension. The historical context of these interactions highlights the cultural tensions between the Celts and the Romans during the Gallic Wars.
