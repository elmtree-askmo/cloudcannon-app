    What are the different types of love according to psychological theories?
answer: >-
    According to various psychological theories, love can be categorized into different types, each with unique characteristics and components. Here are some of the prominent theories and their classifications:\n\n1. **Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love**: Proposed by psychologist Robert Sternberg, this theory identifies three core components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment. These components can combine to form different types of love:\n   - **Romantic Love**: High intimacy and passion, but low commitment.\n   - **Companionate Love**: High intimacy and commitment, but low passion.\n   - **Fatuous Love**: High passion and commitment, but low intimacy.\n   - **Empty Love**: High commitment, but low intimacy and passion.\n   - **Infatuation**: High passion, but low intimacy and commitment.\n   - **Consummate Love**: The ideal form, characterized by high levels of intimacy, passion, and commitment.\n\n2. **Lee's Color Wheel Model of Love**: Psychologist John Lee proposed a model that categorizes love into six styles based on three primary styles (Eros, Ludus, and Storge) and their combinations:\n   - **Eros**: Passionate, romantic love.\n   - **Ludus**: Playful, game-playing love.\n   - **Storge**: Affectionate, friendship-based love.\n   - **Pragma**: Practical love based on compatibility and shared goals.\n   - **Agape**: Selfless, unconditional love.\n   - **Mania**: Obsessive love that combines Eros and Ludus.\n\n3. **Hatfield's Compassionate vs. Passionate Love**: Elaine Hatfield distinguished between two fundamental types of love:\n   - **Passionate Love**: Characterized by intense emotions, sexual attraction, and physiological arousal.\n   - **Compassionate Love**: Involves deep affection, attachment, and a sense of mutual respect and care.\n\n4. **Ancient Greek Types of Love**: The Greeks identified four primary types of love:\n   - **Agape**: Unconditional, selfless love.\n   - **Eros**: Passionate, romantic love.\n   - **Philia**: Friendship love based on mutual respect and camaraderie.\n   - **Storge**: Familial love, the affection between parents and children.\n\nThese theories illustrate the complexity of love and how it can manifest in various forms, influenced by emotional, psychological, and social factors. Understanding these types can help individuals navigate their relationships and recognize the different dimensions of love they may experience.
