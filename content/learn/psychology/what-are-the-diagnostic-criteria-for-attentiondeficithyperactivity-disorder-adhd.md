    What are the diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?
answer: >-
    The diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). According to the DSM-5, the following criteria must be met for a diagnosis of ADHD:\n\n1. **Symptoms of Inattention and/or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity**: Individuals must exhibit a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. This pattern must be present for at least six months and must be inconsistent with the developmental level of the individual.\n\n2. **Specific Symptoms**: For children up to age 16, at least six symptoms from either the inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity categories must be present. For individuals aged 17 and older, at least five symptoms are required. The symptoms can include:\n   - Inattention: Difficulty sustaining attention, careless mistakes, not following through on tasks, difficulty organizing tasks, avoiding tasks requiring sustained mental effort, losing things necessary for tasks, easily distracted, forgetfulness in daily activities.\n   - Hyperactivity-Impulsivity: Fidgeting, leaving seat in situations where remaining seated is expected, running or climbing in inappropriate situations, inability to play or engage in activities quietly, talking excessively, blurting out answers, difficulty waiting for turns, interrupting or intruding on others.\n\n3. **Duration and Settings**: The symptoms must be present for at least six months and must be observed in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or in social situations).\n\n4. **Impact on Functioning**: The symptoms must negatively impact social, academic, or occupational functioning.\n\n5. **Age of Onset**: Several symptoms must have been present before the age of 12.\n\n6. **Exclusion of Other Conditions**: The symptoms must not be better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, etc.).\n\n7. **Specifiers**: ADHD can be specified as predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, or combined presentation, depending on the symptoms exhibited.\n\nThese criteria help ensure that individuals are accurately diagnosed and can receive appropriate treatment for ADHD. The evaluation process often involves gathering information from multiple sources, including parents, teachers, and standardized rating scales, to provide a comprehensive view of the individual's behavior across different settings.
