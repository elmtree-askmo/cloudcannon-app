    What does the course mean by 'measure then model' in visual perception?
answer: >-
    The phrase "measure then model" in the context of visual perception refers to a systematic approach where researchers first quantify specific aspects of visual perception before developing theoretical models to explain or predict these observations. This methodology is crucial in understanding how humans perceive visual stimuli and how these perceptions can be represented mathematically or computationally.\n\n1. **Measurement**: This involves collecting data on how individuals perceive visual information. For example, researchers might use metrics like the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to assess the perceived quality of images based on reference images. This step is essential as it provides empirical data that reflects human visual experiences and responses to various stimuli.\n\n2. **Modeling**: After gathering data, researchers create models that aim to explain the observed phenomena. These models can include probabilistic representations that account for uncertainties in perception. For instance, a model might not only provide a point estimate of a visual feature (like distance) but also include the probabilities associated with various possible values, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in human perception.\n\nThis "measure then model" approach is significant because it allows for a more accurate understanding of visual perception, leading to better applications in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and even practical areas like design and technology. By first measuring how people perceive visual information, researchers can create more robust models that can predict and explain visual behavior in various contexts.
