    How is atypical development defined and studied?
answer: >-
    Atypical development is defined as a deviation from the expected patterns of behavior, emotion, or thought that typically characterize human development. It encompasses a wide range of neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific learning disabilities. These conditions can significantly impact an individual's ability to understand, learn, and engage in social interactions.\n\nAtypical development can occur at any stage of life and is often characterized by unusual patterns that do not align with the genetically preprogrammed processes of typical development. While typical development follows a predictable trajectory influenced by genetic and environmental factors, atypical development may arise due to various influences, including environmental stressors, trauma, or disease.\n\nResearch in atypical development often employs various methodologies, including neuroimaging techniques, to study the brain's maturation and its interaction with developmental trajectories. Studies typically focus on specific age groups, from infancy to early adulthood, to identify how atypical development manifests over time and how it differs from typical development.\n\nIn summary, atypical development is a critical area of study within developmental psychology, as it helps to understand the complexities of human growth and the diverse experiences of individuals who do not follow the conventional developmental path.
