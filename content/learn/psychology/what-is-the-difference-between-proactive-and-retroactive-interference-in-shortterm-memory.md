    What is the difference between proactive and retroactive interference in short-term memory?
answer: >-
    Proactive and retroactive interference are two types of memory interference that can affect both short-term and long-term memory, but they operate in opposite directions.\n\n1. **Proactive Interference**: This occurs when older memories interfere with the retrieval of newer information. For example, if you have learned a new phone number, but you keep recalling your old phone number instead, this is proactive interference. It can hinder your ability to learn new tasks or information because the previously learned material disrupts the recall of the new material.\n\n2. **Retroactive Interference**: In contrast, retroactive interference happens when new information interferes with the retrieval of older memories. A common example is when a student studies for multiple exams. If they first study a list of English verbs and then study a list of French verbs, they may find it difficult to remember the English verbs after learning the French ones. The new information (French verbs) disrupts the recall of the older information (English verbs).\n\nIn summary, the main difference between the two is:\n- **Proactive Interference**: Old memories disrupt the recall of new memories.\n- **Retroactive Interference**: New memories disrupt the recall of old memories.\n\nBoth types of interference highlight the complexities of memory retrieval and the challenges that can arise when trying to learn and remember information. Understanding these concepts can help in developing strategies to mitigate their effects, such as spaced repetition and retrieval practice.
