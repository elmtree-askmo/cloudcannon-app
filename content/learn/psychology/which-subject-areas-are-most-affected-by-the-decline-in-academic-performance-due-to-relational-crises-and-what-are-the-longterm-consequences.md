    Which subject areas are most affected by the decline in academic performance due to relational crises, and what are the long-term consequences?
answer: >-
    The decline in academic performance due to relational crises, particularly among adolescent girls, affects several subject areas, with notable implications for long-term consequences. \n\n### Subject Areas Most Affected\n1. **STEM Subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)**: \n   - Gender stereotypes can significantly impact girls' performance in STEM fields. When teachers hold biased expectations based on gender, it can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where girls may disengage from these subjects, believing they are not suited for them. This disengagement can result in lower academic performance and reduced interest in pursuing careers in these areas.\n\n2. **Language Arts and Social Studies**: \n   - The relational crisis can also affect girls' participation in discussions and their willingness to express their thoughts and opinions. This can lead to a decline in performance in subjects that require verbal communication and critical thinking, such as language arts and social studies.\n\n3. **Overall Academic Engagement**: \n   - The relational crisis can lead to decreased motivation and engagement across all subjects. Girls who experience a loss of voice and self-esteem may withdraw from classroom participation, affecting their overall academic performance.\n\n### Long-term Consequences\n1. **Self-Esteem and Identity Issues**: \n   - The decline in academic performance can contribute to a long-term decrease in self-esteem. Girls may internalize the belief that they are not capable or worthy, which can affect their identity and self-worth well into adulthood.\n\n2. **Career Aspirations**: \n   - The impact of gender stereotypes and relational crises can shape future career choices. Girls may feel discouraged from pursuing certain fields, particularly in STEM, due to societal biases, leading to a narrower range of career options and aspirations.\n\n3. **Psychological Vulnerability**: \n   - The relational crisis can increase the risk of psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. The disconnection from their authentic selves and the pressure to conform to societal expectations can have lasting effects on mental health.\n\n4. **Personal Growth and Well-being**: \n   - The relational crisis can hinder personal growth and overall life satisfaction. Girls may struggle to develop a strong sense of self and may find it challenging to navigate relationships and societal expectations, impacting their well-being in the long term.\n\nIn summary, the decline in academic performance due to relational crises primarily affects STEM subjects and can have profound long-term consequences on self-esteem, career aspirations, psychological health, and personal growth. Addressing these issues through supportive interventions is crucial for helping girls navigate these challenges effectively.
