answer: >-
    Proximodistal development is a key concept in human growth that describes the pattern of development where growth and motor skills emerge from the center of the body and progress outward toward the extremities. This means that the trunk and internal organs develop before the arms and legs. \n\nFor example, during prenatal development, the heart and lungs are among the first organs to form, illustrating the proximodistal trend. As development continues, the limbs begin to grow and develop after the central structures are established. This pattern can also be observed in early childhood, where infants gain control over their torso and then gradually develop fine motor skills in their hands and fingers.\n\nIn summary, proximodistal development emphasizes that the core of the body develops before the outer parts, which is crucial for understanding the sequence and timing of physical growth in humans.
