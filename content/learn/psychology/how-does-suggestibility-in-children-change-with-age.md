    How does suggestibility in children change with age?
answer: >-
    Suggestibility in children changes significantly with age, reflecting their cognitive development and ability to process information. Research indicates that younger children are generally more suggestible than older children and adults. This increased suggestibility in younger children can lead to a higher likelihood of incorporating misleading information into their memories, which can adversely affect the accuracy of their eyewitness testimony.\n\nAccording to the research by Valpini, Melis, Petrolia, and Rosenberg (2016), suggestibility tends to decrease as children grow older. This trend is attributed to the maturation of cognitive abilities, which enhances older children's capacity to critically evaluate information and resist external influences. As children age, they become better at distinguishing between accurate and misleading information, leading to more reliable memory recall.\n\nAdditionally, while older individuals typically provide more accurate testimony due to reduced suggestibility, there are instances where young children may offer accurate accounts, particularly when they are interviewed using non-suggestive techniques. This highlights the importance of appropriate interview methods that minimize the risk of suggestibility, especially in younger populations.\n\nIn summary, suggestibility in children decreases with age, influenced by cognitive development and the ability to critically assess information. This developmental trend underscores the need for careful consideration of interview techniques to ensure the reliability of testimony from children of varying ages.
