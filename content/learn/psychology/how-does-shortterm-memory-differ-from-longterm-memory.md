    How does short-term memory differ from long-term memory?
answer: >-
    Short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) are two distinct types of memory that play crucial roles in how we process and store information.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Duration**:\n   - **Short-term Memory**: STM holds a limited amount of information for a brief period, typically around 20 to 30 seconds. It is often used for tasks such as remembering a phone number long enough to dial it.\n   - **Long-term Memory**: LTM can store vast amounts of information for extended periods, ranging from days to decades. This includes everything from facts and experiences to skills and language.\n\n2. **Capacity**:\n   - **Short-term Memory**: The capacity of STM is limited, often cited as being able to hold about 7Â±2 items (Miller's Law). This means it can only manage a small amount of information at any given time.\n   - **Long-term Memory**: LTM has a much larger capacity, theoretically unlimited, allowing for the storage of extensive information over a lifetime.\n\n3. **Encoding and Retrieval**:\n   - **Short-term Memory**: Information in STM is often encoded acoustically (by sound) or visually. Retrieval from STM can be more effortful, as it involves recalling information that is temporarily stored.\n   - **Long-term Memory**: LTM involves more complex encoding processes, including semantic encoding (meaning-based) and the use of meaningful associations. Retrieval from LTM is generally more effortless, as long-term memories are often more stable and resistant to interference.\n\n4. **Transfer Process**:\n   - The transition from STM to LTM requires processes such as rehearsal and meaningful associations. For example, repeatedly practicing a skill or relating new information to existing knowledge can facilitate this transfer.\n\n5. **Types of Memory**:\n   - **Short-term Memory**: Sometimes overlaps with working memory, which is the active manipulation of information held in STM for cognitive tasks.\n   - **Long-term Memory**: Includes various subtypes, such as explicit (declarative) memory, which encompasses facts and events, and implicit (non-declarative) memory, which includes skills and conditioned responses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the differences between short-term and long-term memory is essential for comprehending how we process information in the present and store it for future use. While STM is crucial for immediate tasks, LTM is vital for learning and retaining knowledge over time. The interplay between these two types of memory is fundamental to our cognitive functioning and overall human development.
