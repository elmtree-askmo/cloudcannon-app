    The concept of the 'magic number' in short-term memory, proposed by George A. Miller, is typically cited as 7 ± 2 chunks of information. This document explains chunking as a cognitive strategy that helps enhance memory capacity by grouping information into manageable units, allowing for better recall.

    What is the 'magic number' in short-term memory span, and how does chunking relate to it?
answer: >-
    The 'magic number' in short-term memory span, as proposed by George A. Miller in his seminal 1956 paper, is typically cited as 7 ± 2. This means that individuals can generally hold between 5 to 9 chunks of information in their short-term memory at any given time. However, more recent research has suggested that this number may be closer to 4 chunks, indicating a reconsideration of the mental storage capacity in short-term memory.\n\nChunking is a cognitive strategy that enhances short-term memory capacity by grouping individual pieces of information into larger, more manageable units or "chunks." For example, instead of trying to remember the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, one might chunk them into 123, 456, and 789. This method allows individuals to remember more information by reducing the number of items they need to recall, as it is the number of chunks that matters rather than the number of individual items.\n\nThe effectiveness of chunking lies in its ability to leverage our existing knowledge and familiarity with certain groupings, making it easier to encode and retrieve information. By organizing data into meaningful units, chunking can significantly boost memory recall, allowing individuals to remember more than they could if they were trying to memorize each piece of information separately.\n\nIn summary, the 'magic number' in short-term memory is often considered to be around 7 chunks, but recent findings suggest it may be closer to 4. Chunking serves as a powerful technique to enhance memory capacity by transforming individual items into larger, more easily remembered groups.
