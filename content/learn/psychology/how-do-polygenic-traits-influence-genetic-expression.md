    How do polygenic traits influence genetic expression?
answer: >-
    Polygenic traits are influenced by the cumulative effects of multiple genes, each contributing to the overall phenotype. This mode of inheritance is distinct from Mendelian inheritance, where a single gene or a pair of alleles determines a trait. In polygenic inheritance, the interaction among various alleles from different genes leads to continuous variation in traits, such as height, skin color, and eye color.\n\nThe expression of polygenic traits is not solely determined by genetic factors; environmental influences also play a significant role. For instance, while genetic predispositions may set a range for a trait, environmental factors can modify the expression of these traits, leading to diverse phenotypic outcomes. This interplay between genetics and environment is crucial in understanding complex traits, as it highlights how both genetic and external factors shape an organism's characteristics.\n\nEach gene involved in a polygenic trait can have alleles that either increase or decrease the trait value, and the cumulative effect of these alleles determines the overall phenotype. This complexity illustrates the non-Mendelian nature of polygenic inheritance, where traits do not follow simple dominant-recessive patterns but rather result from the additive effects of multiple genes.\n\nIn summary, polygenic traits influence genetic expression through the combined action of multiple genes, with significant contributions from environmental factors, leading to a wide range of phenotypic variations.
