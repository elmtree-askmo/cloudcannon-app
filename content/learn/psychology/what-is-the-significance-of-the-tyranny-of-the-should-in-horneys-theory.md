    What is the significance of the 'tyranny of the should' in Horney's theory?
answer: >-
    The concept of the "tyranny of the should" is a significant aspect of Karen Horney's psychoanalytic theory, particularly as articulated in her 1950 work, *Neurosis and Human Growth: The Struggle Toward Self-Realization*. Horney introduced this term to describe the internal pressures individuals feel to conform to unrealistic standards and expectations, which she referred to as "shoulds." \n\nAccording to Horney, these "shoulds" create a division within the self, leading to the emergence of two distinct identities: the ideal self and the real self. The ideal self represents the person one believes they should be, often shaped by societal expectations, personal aspirations, and external pressures. In contrast, the real self is the authentic individual, encompassing true feelings, desires, and capabilities.\n\nThe tyranny of the should manifests as a relentless pursuit of this idealized self, resulting in feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and anxiety when individuals fail to meet these self-imposed standards. For example, one might feel they should always be happy, should never make mistakes, or should always be in control. This constant comparison between the ideal and the real self can lead to a sense of alienation from one's true self, fostering neurotic behaviors and emotional distress.\n\nHorney argued that this internal conflict is detrimental, as it distances individuals from their genuine experiences and emotions. The pressure to conform to these "shoulds" can create a cycle of self-criticism and dissatisfaction, ultimately hindering personal growth and self-acceptance. By recognizing and challenging these unrealistic expectations, individuals can work towards a more authentic and fulfilling existence, aligning their actions with their true selves rather than an unattainable ideal. \n\nIn summary, the significance of the "tyranny of the should" in Horney's theory lies in its role as a mechanism that contributes to neurosis and the construction of a false self, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and the reconciliation of the ideal and real selves for psychological well-being.
