    How do radioactive tracers function in PET scans?
answer: >-
    Radioactive tracers play a crucial role in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, which are used to visualize metabolic processes in the body, including brain activity. Hereâ€™s how they function:\n\n1. **Injection of Radioactive Tracers**: A radioactive substance, often a form of glucose labeled with a radioactive isotope (such as fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG), is injected into the bloodstream. This tracer is designed to mimic natural substances in the body, allowing it to be taken up by cells, particularly those that are metabolically active.\n\n2. **Positron Emission**: As the radioactive tracer decays, it emits positrons, which are the antimatter counterparts of electrons. When these positrons encounter electrons in the body, they annihilate each other, resulting in the production of gamma rays.\n\n3. **Detection of Gamma Rays**: The gamma rays emitted from the positron-electron annihilation are detected by the PET scanner. The scanner consists of a ring of detectors that capture these gamma rays from various angles.\n\n4. **Image Reconstruction**: The data collected from the gamma rays are processed using complex algorithms to create detailed images of the brain or other organs. Areas with higher concentrations of the tracer (indicating higher metabolic activity) appear brighter on the PET images.\n\n5. **Metabolic Activity Visualization**: By analyzing the distribution of the radioactive tracer, researchers can observe which areas of the brain are more active based on glucose metabolism. This is particularly useful in studying brain functions, diagnosing conditions like cancer, and assessing neurological disorders.\n\nOverall, PET scans provide valuable insights into the physiological processes occurring in the brain, making them an important tool in cognitive neuroscience and medical imaging. However, it is worth noting that while PET was one of the pioneering imaging techniques, it has been largely supplanted by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) due to fMRI's higher spatial resolution and safety profile.
