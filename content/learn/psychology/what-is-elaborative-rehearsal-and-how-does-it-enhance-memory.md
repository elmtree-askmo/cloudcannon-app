    What is elaborative rehearsal and how does it enhance memory?
answer: >-
    Elaborative rehearsal is a cognitive process that significantly enhances memory retention by linking new information to existing knowledge. This technique involves actively thinking about the meaning and significance of the information, thereby creating complex associations that facilitate deeper processing. Unlike maintenance rehearsal, which relies on simple repetition, elaborative rehearsal promotes a more profound cognitive engagement with the material.\n\nThe primary benefit of elaborative rehearsal is its ability to transfer information from short-term to long-term memory. By connecting new information to what you already know, you create a semantic network that aids in memory consolidation. This process not only improves retention but also makes it easier to retrieve the information later.\n\nResearch has shown that individuals who engage in elaborative rehearsal tend to have better memory retention compared to those who rely on shallow processing techniques, such as rote memorization. For example, using mnemonic strategies, creating visual images, or forming associations can enhance the effectiveness of elaborative rehearsal. \n\nIn summary, elaborative rehearsal is a powerful memory enhancement technique that involves deep processing and meaningful connections, making it a more effective method for committing information to long-term memory.
