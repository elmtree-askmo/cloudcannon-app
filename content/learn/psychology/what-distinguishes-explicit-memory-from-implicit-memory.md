    What distinguishes explicit memory from implicit memory?
answer: >-
    Explicit memory and implicit memory are two distinct types of memory that differ primarily in their awareness and the processes involved in their retrieval.\n\n### Explicit Memory\n- **Definition**: Explicit memory, also known as declarative memory, involves the conscious recall of information. This type of memory is used when you actively try to remember facts, events, or specific information.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - **Conscious Awareness**: Individuals are aware that they are retrieving information.\n  - **Types**: It can be further divided into:\n    - **Episodic Memory**: Memory of personal experiences and specific events, including contextual details (e.g., your last birthday party).\n    - **Semantic Memory**: Memory of general knowledge and facts about the world (e.g., knowing that Paris is the capital of France).\n- **Examples**: Recalling a friend's name, remembering a historical date, or answering questions on a test.\n\n### Implicit Memory\n- **Definition**: Implicit memory, also known as non-declarative memory, involves memories that are not consciously recalled. This type of memory is often related to skills and tasks that are performed automatically.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - **Unconscious Awareness**: Individuals are typically unaware that they are using this type of memory.\n  - **Types**: It includes procedural memory (skills and tasks) and priming (exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another).\n- **Examples**: Riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, or completing a word stem based on prior exposure to words (e.g., "sta_" could be completed as "star" or "stamp").\n\n### Key Distinctions\n- **Consciousness**: The primary distinction lies in the level of consciousness involved in the retrieval process. Explicit memory requires conscious thought, while implicit memory does not.\n- **Functionality**: Explicit memory is often used for recalling facts and events, whereas implicit memory is utilized for performing tasks and skills without the need for conscious recall.\n\n### Implications in Amnesia\nIndividuals with certain types of amnesia, such as anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new explicit memories), may still retain the ability to learn new skills through implicit memory. This phenomenon highlights the functional separation between these two memory systems.\n\nIn summary, explicit memory is characterized by conscious recall of information, while implicit memory operates unconsciously, influencing behavior and skills without the need for awareness.
