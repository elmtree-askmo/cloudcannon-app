    What are the differences between mitosis and meiosis in cell division?
answer: >-
    Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct processes of cell division in eukaryotic organisms, each serving different purposes and resulting in different outcomes. Here are the key differences between the two:\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Mitosis**: This process is primarily for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. It produces new somatic (body) cells.\n   - **Meiosis**: This process is specifically for sexual reproduction, producing gametes (sperm and egg cells) that contain half the number of chromosomes.\n\n2. **Number of Divisions**:\n   - **Mitosis**: Involves a single division cycle, resulting in two daughter cells.\n   - **Meiosis**: Involves two successive division cycles (meiosis I and meiosis II), resulting in four daughter cells.\n\n3. **Chromosome Number**:\n   - **Mitosis**: Produces two genetically identical diploid cells (2n), maintaining the same chromosome number as the parent cell. For example, in humans, this is 46 chromosomes.\n   - **Meiosis**: Produces four non-identical haploid cells (n), each with half the chromosome number of the parent cell. In humans, this results in 23 chromosomes.\n\n4. **Genetic Variation**:\n   - **Mitosis**: The daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.\n   - **Meiosis**: The daughter cells are genetically diverse due to processes such as crossing over and independent assortment during meiosis I.\n\n5. **Cell Types**:\n   - **Mitosis**: Occurs in somatic cells, which are all body cells except for gametes.\n   - **Meiosis**: Occurs in germ cells, which are specialized cells that give rise to gametes.\n\n6. **Stages**:\n   - Both processes share similar stages (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase), but meiosis includes additional steps such as synapsis and crossing over during prophase I.\n\n7. **Outcome**:\n   - **Mitosis**: Results in two identical daughter cells.\n   - **Meiosis**: Results in four genetically distinct daughter cells.\n\nIn summary, while both mitosis and meiosis are essential for life, they serve different functions and produce different types of cells, reflecting their roles in growth, repair, and reproduction.
