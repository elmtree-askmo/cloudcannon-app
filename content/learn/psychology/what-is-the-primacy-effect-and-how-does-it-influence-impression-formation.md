    What is the primacy effect and how does it influence impression formation?
answer: >-
    The primacy effect is a cognitive phenomenon in social psychology where individuals tend to remember the first pieces of information they receive about a person more vividly than subsequent information. This effect plays a crucial role in impression formation, as initial impressions can significantly shape our overall perception of someone.\n\nFor instance, if the first trait we learn about a person is that they are very friendly, this positive information can create a favorable bias in our judgment. Even if we later encounter negative traits or behaviors, the initial positive impression may overshadow these later revelations. This tendency can lead to a skewed understanding of the individual, as the first impression often sets a cognitive framework through which we interpret subsequent information.\n\nThe primacy effect is particularly important in various social contexts, such as job interviews, first meetings, or any situation where individuals form judgments about one another. It highlights the importance of first encounters and the lasting impact they can have on our perceptions and interactions.\n\nIn summary, the primacy effect influences impression formation by establishing a strong initial framework that can bias our interpretation of later information, often leading to a more favorable or unfavorable view of the individual based on that first impression.
