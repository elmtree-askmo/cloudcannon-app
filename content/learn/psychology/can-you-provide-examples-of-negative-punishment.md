    Negative punishment is a concept in operant conditioning where a desirable stimulus is removed following an undesired behavior, with the goal of decreasing that behavior. Here are some examples of negative punishment:\n\n1. **Taking Away a Toy**: If a child throws a tantrum, a parent might take away their favorite toy as a consequence. This removal of a valued item aims to discourage the child from exhibiting such behavior in the future.\n\n2. **Loss of Privileges**: A teenager who breaks curfew might lose the privilege of going out with friends for a certain period. By removing this social opportunity, the intention is to promote adherence to rules.\n\n3. **Withholding Screen Time**: If a child does not complete their homework, a parent might restrict their access to video games or television. This removal of a pleasurable activity serves to encourage the child to prioritize their responsibilities.\n\n4. **Diminished Free Time**: In a classroom setting, if students are disruptive, the teacher might take away their recess time. This consequence aims to reduce disruptive behavior by removing a valued break.\n\n5. **Loss of Points or Rewards**: In a behavior management system, if a student misbehaves, they might lose points that could be redeemed for rewards. This removal of potential rewards is intended to decrease the likelihood of misbehavior.\n\nThese examples illustrate how negative punishment can be effectively used to modify behavior by taking away something desirable in response to undesirable actions.
