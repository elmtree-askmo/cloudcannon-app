    What genetic factors are known to influence the risk of developing schizophrenia?
answer: >-
    Genetic factors play a significant role in the risk of developing schizophrenia, with research indicating that heritability estimates range from 70% to 90%. Twin and family studies suggest that genetic factors can explain approximately 80% of the risk for this psychiatric condition. \n\nRecent advancements in genetic research have identified a highly polygenic nature of schizophrenia, where the majority of the explained heritability comes from common alleles of small effect, alongside contributions from rare copy number variants and coding variants. For instance, a landmark study involving over 121,000 individuals identified extremely rare protein-disrupting mutations in 10 specific genes that can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia by more than 20-fold.\n\nOne of the most notable genetic influences is linked to the chromosome 6 region, particularly the C4 gene, which has been associated with excessive synaptic pruning during adolescenceâ€”a process that, when dysregulated, may impair mental function. Additionally, the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is a rare mutation that significantly increases the lifetime risk of schizophrenia by 25-fold.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated nearly 300 common genetic variants and over 20 rare variants as risk factors for schizophrenia. The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus on chromosome 6 has been identified as the strongest known genetic risk factor, with associations found between schizophrenia and genetic markers across this region.\n\nOverall, while substantial progress has been made in understanding the genetic underpinnings of schizophrenia, there remains a portion of heritability that is not fully explained by known genetic variants, indicating the potential existence of "missing heritability." This ongoing research continues to shed light on the complex genetic landscape of schizophrenia and its implications for treatment and prevention.
