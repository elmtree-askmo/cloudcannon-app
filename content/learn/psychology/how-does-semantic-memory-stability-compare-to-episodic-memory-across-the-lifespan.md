    How does semantic memory stability compare to episodic memory across the lifespan?
answer: >-
    Semantic memory stability and episodic memory decline exhibit contrasting patterns across the lifespan. \n\n1. **Episodic Memory**: This type of memory involves the conscious recollection of autobiographical events and experiences. Research indicates that episodic memory tends to decline with age. Older adults often experience difficulties in recalling specific events or details, which can lead to a diminished ability to remember personal experiences over time.\n\n2. **Semantic Memory**: In contrast, semantic memory, which encompasses facts, concepts, and general knowledge, remains relatively stable throughout the aging process. Older adults typically retain their knowledge of facts and vocabulary, and this type of memory is less affected by age-related decline compared to episodic memory.\n\n3. **Self-Defining Memories (SDMs)**: Interestingly, while episodic memory may decline, older adults often report that their self-defining memories are more vivid, positive, and emotionally intense. These memories may include integrative meaning statements that reflect the importance of these experiences in their lives.\n\nIn summary, while episodic memory is susceptible to decline with age, semantic memory shows a remarkable degree of stability, allowing older adults to maintain their factual knowledge and understanding of the world. This distinction highlights the different ways in which memory systems are affected by aging, with semantic memory providing a resilient foundation of knowledge even as episodic memory may falter.
