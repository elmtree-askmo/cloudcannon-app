    What are the prevalence and risk factors for major depressive disorder?
answer: >-
    Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant mental health concern with varying prevalence rates and risk factors across different populations. \n\n### Prevalence\n- In the United States, approximately **21 million adults** experienced at least one major depressive episode, representing about **8.3%** of the adult population. The prevalence is notably higher among adult females, with **10.3%** reporting a major depressive episode compared to **6.2%** of males.\n- Among younger adults aged **18-25 years**, the prevalence is particularly high, with nearly **20%** reporting a major depressive episode. This age group has the highest prevalence rate at **18.6%**.\n- A 2016 study in Singapore found a **12-month prevalence** of MDD at **2.3%**, with a **lifetime prevalence** of **6.3%**.\n- Globally, the World Health Organization identifies depression as the leading cause of disability, affecting approximately **300 million people**.\n\n### Risk Factors\nIdentifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for the prevention of MDD. Some of the key risk factors include:\n- **Gender**: Women are more likely to experience depression than men, with studies indicating that the prevalence of depression is approximately twice as high in women.\n- **Age**: Younger adults, particularly those aged 18-25, show higher rates of major depressive episodes.\n- **Chronic Health Conditions**: There is a significant association between MDD and chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, and arthritis. Individuals with these conditions often report higher rates of depression.\n- **Geographic Variation**: Prevalence rates can vary significantly by region, with higher rates observed in areas such as the Appalachian region and the southern Mississippi Valley in the U.S.\n\nUnderstanding these prevalence rates and risk factors is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for Major Depressive Disorder.
