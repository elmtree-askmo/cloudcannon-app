    How does psychological realism provide insight into madness and obsession in literature?
answer: >-
    Psychological realism is a powerful literary approach that provides profound insights into madness and obsession by delving into the inner thoughts and emotions of characters. This technique allows authors to explore complex psychological issues, particularly in works like Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper." \n\nIn these narratives, psychological realism reveals how characters grapple with their mental states, often leading to irrational behavior and a distorted perception of reality. For instance, in "The Tell-Tale Heart," the narrator's obsession with the old man's "evil eye" serves as a focal point for his madness. This fixation illustrates how an external object can dominate one's thoughts, driving them to commit heinous acts. The narrator's insistence on his sanity, despite his actions, highlights a profound disconnect between his mental state and moral responsibility, a key aspect of psychological realism.\n\nMoreover, the use of symbolism in these works enhances the exploration of madness. The eye symbolizes the narrator's obsession and paranoia, while the lantern represents his futile attempt to bring clarity to his distorted thoughts. This interplay of symbols emphasizes the psychological disconnect that characterizes the narrator's descent into madness, showcasing how obsession can lead to a complete detachment from reality.\n\nPsychological realism also allows for a nuanced understanding of the characters' motivations and the societal pressures they face. In "The Yellow Wallpaper," for example, the protagonist's struggle against societal norms and her own mental health issues is depicted through her obsession with the wallpaper in her room. This obsession reflects her deteriorating mental state and the oppressive nature of her environment, further illustrating the themes of isolation and madness.\n\nIn summary, psychological realism provides a framework for understanding the complexities of madness and obsession in literature. By focusing on the inner workings of characters' minds, authors can effectively portray the psychological struggles that lead to irrational behavior and a disconnection from reality, ultimately enriching the reader's comprehension of these themes.
