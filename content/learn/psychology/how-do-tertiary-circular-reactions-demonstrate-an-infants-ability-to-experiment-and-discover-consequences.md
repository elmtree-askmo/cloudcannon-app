    How do tertiary circular reactions demonstrate an infant's ability to experiment and discover consequences?
answer: >-
    Tertiary circular reactions, which occur between 12 to 18 months of age, are a critical aspect of cognitive development in infants. During this substage of the sensorimotor stage, infants demonstrate their ability to experiment and discover the consequences of their actions through deliberate experimentation.\n\nIn this phase, infants actively engage with their environment by manipulating objects and observing the outcomes of their actions. For example, an infant might drop a ball from different heights to see how it bounces. This behavior illustrates several key cognitive processes:\n\n1. **Curiosity and Exploration**: Infants are driven by curiosity, prompting them to explore various ways to interact with objects. Their willingness to try different actions indicates a growing understanding of cause and effect.\n\n2. **Trial and Error Learning**: Through repeated actions, infants learn from the results of their experiments. If they notice that dropping the ball from a higher height results in a different bounce than from a lower height, they begin to understand the relationship between their actions and the outcomes.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: As infants experiment, they develop problem-solving skills. They may try to achieve a specific goal, such as making a toy roll further or bounce higher, and adjust their actions based on previous experiences.\n\n4. **Mental Representations**: This stage also marks the beginning of internalizing schemas, where infants start to form mental representations of their experiences. They begin to understand that their actions can lead to predictable outcomes, which is foundational for more complex cognitive processes in later stages of development.\n\nOverall, tertiary circular reactions highlight an infant's growing cognitive abilities, showcasing their capacity for experimentation, learning through consequences, and the development of problem-solving skills. This substage is essential for laying the groundwork for more advanced cognitive functions as they transition to the next stages of development.
