    The lobotomy procedure, developed by Antonio Egas Moniz in the 1930s, aimed to treat severe mental disorders by severing brain connections. Moniz received the Nobel Prize in 1949 for his work, but lobotomies are no longer performed due to severe side effects and ethical concerns.

    Who developed the lobotomy procedure, and what recognition did they receive for it?
answer: >-
    The lobotomy procedure was developed and popularized by Antonio Egas Moniz, a Portuguese physician, in the 1930s. Moniz believed that severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex could alleviate symptoms of severe mental disorders, particularly psychosis. For his work in this area, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949, which recognized his contributions to the treatment of mental illness through psychosurgery.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that lobotomies often resulted in severe side effects, including personality changes, cognitive deficits, and in some cases, death. The practice has been largely discredited and is no longer performed in modern medicine due to ethical concerns and the availability of more effective treatments for mental health conditions.
