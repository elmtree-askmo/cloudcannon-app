    What are the symptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder?
answer: >-
    Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), individuals with HPD must exhibit at least five of the following symptoms:\n\n1. **Discomfort when not the center of attention**: Individuals often feel uncomfortable or unappreciated when they are not the focus of attention.\n2. **Inappropriate seductive behavior**: They may engage in provocative or seductive behavior to draw attention to themselves.\n3. **Rapidly shifting and shallow emotions**: Their emotional expressions can be intense but are often short-lived and superficial.\n4. **Consistently using physical appearance to draw attention**: They may place excessive emphasis on their physical appearance to gain approval or attention.\n5. **Excessive emotionality**: Individuals with HPD often display exaggerated emotions and may be perceived as overly dramatic.\n6. **Easily influenced by others**: Their opinions and feelings can be easily swayed by others, reflecting a lack of self-confidence.\n7. **Believing that relationships are more intimate than they actually are**: They may perceive relationships as more significant or closer than they truly are.\n\nThese symptoms typically manifest in early adulthood and can significantly impact interpersonal relationships and self-image. Treatment approaches often include psychotherapy, which can help individuals develop healthier coping mechanisms and improve their emotional regulation.
