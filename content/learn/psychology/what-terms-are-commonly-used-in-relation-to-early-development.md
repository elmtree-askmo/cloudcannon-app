    What terms are commonly used in relation to early development?
answer: >-
    In relation to early development, several key terms are commonly used to describe various aspects of this complex process. Here are some of the most significant terms:\n\n1. **Embryonic Development**: This refers to the stages of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation. It includes critical processes such as cleavage, gastrulation, and organogenesis.\n\n2. **Fetal Development**: Following the embryonic stage, fetal development occurs from the ninth week until birth. This stage is characterized by the growth and maturation of the organs formed during the embryonic period.\n\n3. **Neurulation**: This is the process during embryonic development that leads to the formation of the neural tube, which will eventually develop into the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).\n\n4. **Cognitive Development**: This term encompasses the progression of thinking, problem-solving, and understanding in children, which is influenced by both neurological and psychological factors.\n\n5. **Developmental Stages**: These are specific periods in a child's growth, often categorized into stages such as infancy, toddlerhood, preschool age, and school age, each marked by distinct developmental milestones.\n\n6. **Cell Division Processes**: This includes mitosis and meiosis, which are essential for growth and development. In early development, cleavage is a specific type of mitotic division that produces smaller cells without increasing the overall volume.\n\n7. **Age of Viability**: This term refers to the point in fetal development (around 24 weeks of gestation) when a fetus has a reasonable chance of survival outside the womb with medical assistance.\n\n8. **Germ Layers**: During embryonic development, three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) form, which will differentiate into various tissues and organs.\n\n9. **Implantation**: This is the process by which a blastocyst embeds itself into the uterine wall, marking the beginning of pregnancy.\n\n10. **Amniotic Fluid**: This fluid surrounds the developing fetus, providing cushioning and a stable environment for growth.\n\nThese terms are foundational in understanding the processes and stages of early human development, and they are frequently used in fields such as developmental psychology, embryology, and neuropsychology.
