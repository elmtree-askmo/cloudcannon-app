answer: >-
    Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health concern that can result from various external forces impacting the head or body. The common causes of TBI include:\n\n1. **Falls**: This is the leading cause of TBI, particularly among older adults aged 65 and older, as well as young children.\n2. **Motor Vehicle Accidents**: These are a prevalent cause of TBI in young adults, often resulting from collisions involving cars, motorcycles, and bicycles.\n3. **Sports Injuries**: Participation in contact sports can lead to TBIs due to impacts or falls.\n4. **Being Struck by an Object**: This can occur in various settings, including workplaces or during sports activities.\n5. **Assaults**: Physical violence can also result in traumatic brain injuries.\n\nThe effects of TBI can vary widely depending on the severity of the injury and the areas of the brain affected. Common effects include:\n\n- **Cognitive Impairments**: These may manifest as memory problems, difficulties with problem-solving, and impaired judgment.\n- **Physical Symptoms**: Individuals may experience paralysis, weakness, poor coordination, and balance issues.\n- **Emotional and Behavioral Changes**: TBI can lead to mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and depression.\n- **Sensory Problems**: Changes in vision, hearing, taste, and touch can occur, along with difficulties in understanding sensory information.\n- **Communication Challenges**: Individuals may struggle with speech, understanding language, and performing everyday tasks.\n\nLong-term effects can include chronic pain, headaches, and the potential for developing psychiatric disorders due to changes in brain chemistry. The rehabilitation process is crucial and often involves a multidisciplinary team to address the various challenges faced by individuals with TBI. The success of rehabilitation can depend on factors such as the nature and severity of the injury, the individual's overall health, and the support available from family and caregivers.
