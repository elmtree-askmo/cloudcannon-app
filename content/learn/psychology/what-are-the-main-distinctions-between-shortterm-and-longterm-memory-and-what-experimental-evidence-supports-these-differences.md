    What are the main distinctions between short-term and long-term memory, and what experimental evidence supports these differences?
answer: >-
    The distinctions between short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) are fundamental in understanding how memory functions. Here are the main differences:\n\n### 1. Duration\n- **Short-term Memory (STM)**: STM holds information temporarily, typically for seconds to minutes. For example, remembering a phone number just long enough to dial it is an instance of STM.\n- **Long-term Memory (LTM)**: LTM can store information for extended periods, ranging from hours to a lifetime. An example of LTM is recalling your childhood home address.\n\n### 2. Capacity\n- **STM**: The capacity of STM is limited, often described by Miller's Law, which suggests it can hold about seven items (plus or minus two) at a time.\n- **LTM**: LTM has a much larger capacity and is believed to be virtually unlimited, allowing for the storage of vast amounts of information over time.\n\n### 3. Encoding\n- **STM**: Information in STM is often encoded acoustically (based on sound) or visually (based on sight).\n- **LTM**: Information in LTM is typically encoded semantically (based on meaning), which aids in the organization and retrieval of memories.\n\n### 4. Retrieval\n- **STM**: Retrieval from STM is usually quick and requires conscious effort, as it involves immediate recall.\n- **LTM**: Retrieval from LTM can be slower and may require cues or prompts, as it often involves more complex processes.\n\n### Experimental Evidence Supporting These Differences\nSeveral experimental studies have provided evidence for the distinctions between STM and LTM:\n\n1. **Miller's Law**: George A. Miller's research in the 1950s established the concept of the "magic number seven," demonstrating the limited capacity of STM through tasks that required participants to recall lists of items.\n\n2. **The Serial Position Effect**: Studies by Murdoch (1962) showed that people tend to remember items at the beginning (primacy effect) and the end (recency effect) of a list better than those in the middle. This effect illustrates how items in STM (recency) and LTM (primacy) are processed differently.\n\n3. **The Case of H.M.**: The famous case of patient H.M., who underwent a bilateral medial temporal lobe resection, provided insights into the separation of STM and LTM. H.M. could hold information in STM but was unable to form new long-term memories, highlighting the functional distinction between these two memory systems.\n\n4. **Neuroimaging Studies**: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown different brain activation patterns when individuals engage in tasks that require STM versus LTM. For instance, areas such as the prefrontal cortex are more active during STM tasks, while the hippocampus is crucial for LTM formation and retrieval.\n\nThese distinctions and supporting evidence illustrate the complexity of memory processes and the functional specialization of different memory systems in the brain.
