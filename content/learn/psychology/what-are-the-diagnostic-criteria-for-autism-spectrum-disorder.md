    What are the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder?
answer: >-
    The diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are outlined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in 2013. According to the DSM-5, the diagnosis of ASD is based on the presence of persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. \n\nThe specific criteria for diagnosing ASD include:\n\n1. **Deficits in Social Communication and Social Interaction**: This must be evident in all of the following areas:\n   - **Social-emotional reciprocity**: This includes difficulties in back-and-forth conversations, reduced sharing of interests or emotions, and failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.\n   - **Nonverbal communicative behaviors**: This encompasses challenges in using and interpreting nonverbal cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures.\n   - **Developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships**: This involves difficulties in adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts, sharing imaginative play, or making friends.\n\n2. **Restricted, Repetitive Patterns of Behavior, Interests, or Activities**: This must include at least two of the following:\n   - **Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech**: Examples include simple motor stereotypes, lining up toys, or echolalia (repeating phrases).\n   - **Insistence on sameness**: This can manifest as extreme distress at small changes, rigid adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior.\n   - **Highly restricted, fixated interests**: These interests are abnormal in intensity or focus, such as an intense preoccupation with specific topics or objects.\n   - **Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input**: This includes unusual responses to sensory experiences, such as indifference to pain or temperature, or adverse reactions to specific sounds or textures.\n\n3. **Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period**: Although they may not fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.\n\n4. **The symptoms are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay**: A diagnosis of ASD can coexist with intellectual disability, but social communication should be below the expected level for the individual's developmental age.\n\nThese criteria help clinicians make a comprehensive assessment of individuals suspected of having ASD, ensuring that the diagnosis is accurate and consistent across different settings.
