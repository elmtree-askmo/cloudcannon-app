    What are the core symptoms of conduct disorder related to aggression and intimidation?
answer: >-
    The core symptoms of conduct disorder (CD) related to aggression and intimidation include:\n\n1. **Aggression Towards People and Animals**: This can manifest as physical fights, bullying, or threatening behavior towards peers, family members, or animals. Individuals with CD may show a pattern of physical aggression that is more severe than typical childhood behavior.\n\n2. **Destruction of Property**: This includes vandalism or deliberate destruction of others' belongings. Such behaviors are often intended to intimidate or assert control over others.\n\n3. **Deceitfulness**: This symptom involves lying, stealing, or manipulating others for personal gain or to avoid consequences. This deceit can be used as a means to intimidate or exert power over others.\n\n4. **Serious Violations of Rules**: Individuals with CD often disregard societal norms and rules, which can include running away from home, truancy, or engaging in illegal activities. These actions can create an intimidating environment for others.\n\nThese symptoms reflect a persistent pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others and societal norms, often leading to significant personal and societal consequences. The prevalence of conduct disorder is estimated to be between 5-7% in youth, with a higher incidence in males compared to females. Early intervention is crucial, as conduct disorder can be a precursor to more severe antisocial behavior in adulthood.
