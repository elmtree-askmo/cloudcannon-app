    How is personality defined in psychological terms?
answer: >-
    In psychological terms, personality is defined as the enduring configuration of characteristics and behaviors that comprise an individual's unique adjustment to life. This includes major traits, interests, drives, values, self-concept, abilities, and emotional patterns. Personality is often viewed as a complex and dynamic integration shaped by various factors, including hereditary influences, physical maturation, and environmental experiences.\n\nThe study of personality focuses on understanding and describing the unique and enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that differentiate individuals from one another. It encompasses individual differences in how people think, feel, and behave, and seeks to explain the relatively stable psychological characteristics that define a person over time and across different situations.\n\nAdditionally, personality psychology investigates how personality develops, operates, and varies, including the exploration of personality disorders. The field employs various theories and models, such as the Big Five Personality Traits, which categorize personality into five broad dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These frameworks help in understanding the complexities of personality and its impact on behavior.
