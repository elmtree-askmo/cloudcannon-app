    How is Internet Gaming Addiction currently classified in the DSM-5?
answer: >-
    Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is classified in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) under Section III, which is designated for "Conditions for Further Study." This classification indicates that while IGD is recognized as a potential mental health condition, it requires further empirical research to establish its validity and reliability as a formal diagnosis.\n\nThe DSM-5 outlines nine criteria that may be used to diagnose Internet Gaming Disorder. These criteria focus on the individual's behavior related to internet gaming, such as:\n\n1. Preoccupation with internet games.\n2. Withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away.\n3. The need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet games.\n4. Unsuccessful attempts to control the amount of gaming.\n5. Loss of interest in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, internet games.\n6. Continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems.\n7. Deceiving family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of gaming.\n8. Use of internet games to escape or relieve a negative mood.\n9. Jeopardizing or losing a significant relationship, job, or education or career opportunity because of participation in internet games.\n\nIt is important to note that the DSM-5 specifically states that the criteria for IGD are limited to internet gaming and do not encompass general internet use, online gambling, or social media activities. The inclusion of IGD in the DSM-5 aims to encourage further research into its prevalence, risk factors, and the development of more comprehensive diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe classification of IGD has sparked considerable debate within the mental health community, with ongoing discussions about its implications and the need for more robust research to support its recognition as a formal mental disorder.
