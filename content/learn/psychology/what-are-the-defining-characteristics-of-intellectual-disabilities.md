    What are the defining characteristics of intellectual disabilities?
answer: >-
    Intellectual disabilities (ID) are defined by several key characteristics that distinguish them from other types of disabilities. Here are the defining characteristics of intellectual disabilities:\n\n1. **Significant Limitations in Intellectual Functioning**: Individuals with intellectual disabilities exhibit significant limitations in cognitive abilities, which include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and other intellectual tasks. This is typically assessed through standardized IQ tests, where an IQ score below 70 is often indicative of an intellectual disability.\n\n2. **Adaptive Behavior Challenges**: In addition to cognitive limitations, individuals with ID also face challenges in adaptive behaviors. Adaptive behaviors encompass a range of everyday social and practical skills necessary for functioning in daily life, such as communication, self-care, social skills, and the ability to live independently.\n\n3. **Onset Before Age 18**: Intellectual disabilities are typically identified during the developmental period, meaning they manifest before the age of 18. This early onset is crucial for diagnosis and intervention.\n\n4. **Variability in Severity**: The severity of intellectual disabilities can vary widely among individuals. Some may require extensive support in daily living, while others may be able to live more independently with minimal assistance. This variability is often categorized into mild, moderate, severe, and profound levels of intellectual disability.\n\n5. **Impact on Learning and Social Interaction**: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often face challenges in learning environments and social interactions. They may require specialized educational support and interventions to help them succeed academically and socially.\n\n6. **Examples of Conditions**: Common conditions classified as intellectual disabilities include Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and other genetic or environmental factors that affect cognitive development.\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is essential for providing appropriate support, accommodations, and interventions for individuals with intellectual disabilities, ensuring they have access to education and opportunities for personal development.
