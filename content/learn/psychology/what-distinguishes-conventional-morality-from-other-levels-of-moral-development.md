    What distinguishes conventional morality from other levels of moral development?
answer: >-
    Conventional morality, as defined by Lawrence Kohlberg in his theory of moral development, is distinguished from other levels of moral development—pre-conventional and post-conventional—by its focus on social norms and the expectations of others.\n\n1. **Focus on Social Approval**: At the conventional level, particularly in Stage 3 (Good Boy/Good Girl Orientation), moral reasoning is primarily concerned with gaining approval from others. Individuals judge actions as right or wrong based on how they align with social expectations and the desire to be seen as "good" by peers and authority figures.\n\n2. **Adherence to Laws and Rules**: In Stage 4 (Law and Order Orientation), moral reasoning shifts to a more structured approach where individuals evaluate actions based on their adherence to laws and rules. This stage emphasizes the importance of maintaining social order and the belief that laws are essential for the functioning of society.\n\n3. **Contrast with Pre-Conventional Morality**: In contrast, pre-conventional morality (Stages 1 and 2) is characterized by self-centered reasoning. Individuals at this level make moral decisions based on the consequences for themselves, such as avoiding punishment or seeking personal rewards. This self-focused perspective is less concerned with societal norms and more with individual gain.\n\n4. **Contrast with Post-Conventional Morality**: Post-conventional morality (Stages 5 and 6) represents a further evolution in moral reasoning, where individuals begin to consider universal ethical principles and the rights of individuals. At this level, moral judgments are based on principles that transcend specific laws and social agreements, focusing on justice, fairness, and individual rights.\n\nIn summary, conventional morality is marked by a shift from self-centered reasoning to a focus on social norms and the importance of laws, distinguishing it from both the self-focused pre-conventional level and the principled post-conventional level.
