answer: >-
    In surrealist practices, hypnosis and trance states were utilized as essential tools for accessing the unconscious mind and fostering creativity. The surrealists, particularly AndrÃ© Breton, believed that by inducing a trance-like state through hypnosis or meditation, artists could transcend the constraints of rational thought and delve deeper into their subconscious. This approach was rooted in the idea that the unconscious held a wealth of untapped creativity and insight.\n\nThe surrealist group engaged in hypnotic trance sessions, which were a significant experimental activity during the early 1920s. These sessions were meticulously documented, with 543 pages of notes and drawings preserved by Breton, showcasing the intersection of science and the occult in their practices. The aim was to provoke new states of consciousness and to explore the depths of the mind, allowing for the production of unfiltered art.\n\nBreton's understanding of contemporary psychology, influenced by figures like Jean-Martin Charcot and Pierre Janet, informed the surrealists' methodologies. They employed techniques such as automatic writing, where artists would write without conscious control, allowing the unconscious to guide their hand. This practice was seen as a form of psychic automatism, which Breton defined as the purest expression of surrealism.\n\nAdditionally, the surrealists experimented with speaking in hypnotic trance, drawing inspiration from mediums and sÃ©ances, albeit without the intent of communicating with the dead. This exploration of altered states of consciousness was central to their philosophy, as it enabled them to bypass rational thought and unlock deeper layers of creativity.\n\nIn summary, hypnosis and trance states were pivotal in surrealist practices, serving as gateways to the unconscious and facilitating the creation of art that challenged conventional notions of reality.
