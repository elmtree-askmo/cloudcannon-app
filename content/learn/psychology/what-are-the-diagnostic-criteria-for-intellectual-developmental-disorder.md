    What are the diagnostic criteria for Intellectual Developmental Disorder?
answer: >-
    The diagnostic criteria for Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), include the following key components:\n\n1. **Deficits in Intellectual Functioning**: This is characterized by significant limitations in general mental capacity, which includes abilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptive functioning. These deficits are typically assessed through standardized testing, such as an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test, where an IQ score significantly below the average (typically below 70) is indicative of IDD.\n\n2. **Deficits in Adaptive Functioning**: In addition to intellectual deficits, individuals must also exhibit limitations in adaptive functioning across three domains:\n   - **Conceptual Domain**: This includes academic skills, communication, self-direction, and functional academics.\n   - **Social Domain**: This encompasses interpersonal abilities, social responsibility, and the ability to form friendships.\n   - **Practical Domain**: This involves personal care, safety, health, and the ability to manage daily living tasks.\n\n3. **Onset During the Developmental Period**: The symptoms must manifest during the developmental period, which is typically defined as before the age of 18. This criterion distinguishes IDD from other disorders that may present later in life.\n\n4. **Clinical Assessment**: The diagnosis is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive functions. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that the diagnosis is accurate and considers the individual's overall functioning.\n\nThese criteria reflect a significant shift from previous terminology and diagnostic frameworks, emphasizing a more nuanced understanding of the disorder's impact on an individual's functioning and the importance of early diagnosis and intervention.
