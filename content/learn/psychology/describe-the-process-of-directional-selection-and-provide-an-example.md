    Describe the process of directional selection and provide an example.
answer: >-
    Directional selection is a process in evolutionary biology where individuals with a particular trait are favored over others, leading to an increase in the frequency of that trait within a population over successive generations. This type of selection typically occurs in response to environmental changes or pressures that make certain traits more advantageous for survival and reproduction.\n\n### Process of Directional Selection\n\n1. **Variation in Traits**: Within a population, there is genetic variation among individuals. This variation is crucial as it provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon.\n\n2. **Environmental Pressure**: An environmental change or challenge (such as a change in food availability, climate, or predation) creates a situation where certain traits become more beneficial than others.\n\n3. **Survival and Reproduction**: Individuals possessing the advantageous trait are more likely to survive and reproduce. This non-random survival means that the traits that confer an advantage are passed on to the next generation.\n\n4. **Increase in Trait Frequency**: Over time, the frequency of the advantageous trait increases in the population, while the frequency of less advantageous traits decreases.\n\n### Example of Directional Selection\n\nA classic example of directional selection is observed in the beak size of finches, particularly during periods of drought. In the Galápagos Islands, when drought conditions occurred, the available seeds became larger and harder. Finches with larger beaks were better equipped to crack open these seeds, giving them a survival advantage. As a result, over several generations, the average beak size in the finch population increased, demonstrating directional selection in response to environmental pressures.\n\nThis example illustrates how directional selection can lead to significant changes in a population's traits over time, driven by the advantages conferred by specific phenotypes in a changing environment.
