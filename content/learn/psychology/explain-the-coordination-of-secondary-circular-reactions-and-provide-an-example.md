    Explain the coordination of secondary circular reactions and provide an example.
answer: >-
    The coordination of secondary circular reactions is a significant developmental milestone in the sensorimotor stage of cognitive development, occurring between 8 to 12 months of age. During this substage, infants begin to intentionally combine previously learned secondary circular reactions to achieve specific goals. This marks a shift from simple, reflexive actions to more complex, goal-directed behaviors.\n\nFor example, an infant might drop a toy into a cup and then pick up the cup to explore the outcome. This action demonstrates an understanding of cause and effect, as the infant realizes that dropping the toy results in a change in the environment (the toy is now in the cup). The ability to plan and execute a sequence of actions to achieve a desired result indicates a more advanced level of cognitive organization.\n\nIn summary, the coordination of secondary circular reactions reflects the infant's growing cognitive abilities, including intentionality, problem-solving, and the ability to imitate new actions. This development lays the groundwork for further cognitive advancements in later stages, such as the tertiary circular reactions and the internalization of schemas.
