    What role does the basal ganglia play in non-declarative memory, specifically in procedural memory?
answer: >-
    The basal ganglia play a crucial role in non-declarative memory, particularly in procedural memory, which involves the learning and execution of skills and actions. Procedural memory is characterized by the ability to perform tasks without conscious awareness, such as riding a bike, playing a musical instrument, or typing.\n\nThe basal ganglia, along with the cerebellum, are essential for the acquisition and retention of procedural skills. These brain structures facilitate the automation of movements and the development of habits, allowing individuals to perform complex tasks efficiently after sufficient practice. This is particularly evident in cases where declarative memory (which involves facts and events) is impaired, yet individuals can still retain and execute procedural skills. For instance, studies involving patients with amnesia, such as Henry Molaison (H.M.), have shown that while they could not form new declarative memories, they could still learn new motor skills, indicating that the basal ganglia and cerebellum were functioning properly.\n\nIn summary, the basal ganglia are integral to the processes underlying procedural memory, enabling the learning and execution of skills through mechanisms that operate independently of declarative memory systems. This distinction highlights the complexity of memory systems and the specialized roles different brain regions play in memory formation and retrieval.
