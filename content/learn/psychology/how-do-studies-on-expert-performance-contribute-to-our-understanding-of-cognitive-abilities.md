    How do studies on expert performance contribute to our understanding of cognitive abilities?
answer: >-
    Studies on expert performance significantly enhance our understanding of cognitive abilities by illustrating how expertise is developed and how it relates to cognitive processes. The expert-performance approach posits that performance on tests of general cognitive ability is correlated among beginners, which aligns with findings from laboratory studies and job performance reviews (Ackerman, 1987; Schmidt & Hunter, 2004). This suggests that foundational cognitive abilities play a crucial role in the initial stages of skill acquisition.\n\nOne of the key insights from decades of research is that experts in various fields engage in extensive and deliberate practice to refine their perceptual-cognitive and motor skills. Deliberate Practice (DP) involves specific tasks designed to provide immediate feedback and is performed repetitively with the goal of improvement. This structured approach to practice highlights that expert performance is not merely a reflection of innate abilities but is significantly influenced by the cognitive structures developed through sustained effort and training.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between cognitive abilities and expert performance indicates that while general cognitive ability (GMA) is predictive of performance, the structure of expert performance corresponds to extreme cases within the underlying ability distributions. This means that while cognitive abilities are important, the highest levels of performance are also shaped by domain-specific skills and knowledge acquired through experience.\n\nResearch has also shown that cognitive and perceptual-motor skills, along with physiological adaptations, mediate expert performance. For instance, studies have indicated that anxiety can impact skilled performers' ability to process high-level cognitive information, suggesting that emotional and situational factors also play a role in expert performance.\n\nIn summary, studies on expert performance contribute to our understanding of cognitive abilities by demonstrating the importance of deliberate practice, the interplay between innate abilities and acquired skills, and the influence of situational factors on cognitive processing. This comprehensive view helps to clarify the complexities of cognitive abilities and their measurement, particularly in the context of high-level performance across various domains.
