answer: >-
    Cognitive psychology focuses on understanding mental processes such as perception, memory, reasoning, and problem-solving. The key psychological characteristics studied in cognitive psychology include:\n\n1. **Perception**: This involves how individuals interpret sensory information and make sense of their environment. It plays a crucial role in how we understand and interact with the world.\n\n2. **Memory**: Cognitive psychologists study different types of memory (e.g., short-term, long-term, working memory) and how information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Memory is essential for learning and influences cognitive development.\n\n3. **Reasoning and Problem-Solving**: These processes involve the ability to think logically, make decisions, and solve problems. Cognitive psychology examines how individuals approach challenges and the strategies they use.\n\n4. **Attention**: This characteristic pertains to how individuals focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others. Attention is vital for effective learning and cognitive processing.\n\n5. **Language**: Cognitive psychology also explores how language is acquired, understood, and produced, which is fundamental to communication and cognitive development.\n\n6. **Cognitive Styles**: These refer to the preferred ways individuals process information, which can affect learning and problem-solving approaches.\n\nThese psychological characteristics are closely related to cognitive development, which is the process by which individuals acquire and refine their cognitive abilities over time. Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development outlines four major stages:\n\n1. **Sensorimotor Stage** (birth to 2 years): Infants learn through sensory experiences and manipulating objects. They develop object permanence and begin to understand the world through their actions.\n\n2. **Preoperational Stage** (2 to 7 years): Children begin to use language and think symbolically but lack the ability to perform operations mentally. They are egocentric and struggle with understanding others' perspectives.\n\n3. **Concrete Operational Stage** (7 to 11 years): Children start to think logically about concrete events. They gain a better understanding of the concept of conservation and can perform operations mentally, but still struggle with abstract concepts.\n\n4. **Formal Operational Stage** (12 years and up): Adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and use deductive reasoning. They can consider hypothetical situations and think about possibilities.\n\nUnderstanding these stages helps in recognizing how cognitive characteristics evolve and influence behavior, learning, and emotional responses throughout an individual's development. Cognitive psychology provides insights into how these processes can be nurtured or hindered, impacting overall psychological well-being and functioning.
