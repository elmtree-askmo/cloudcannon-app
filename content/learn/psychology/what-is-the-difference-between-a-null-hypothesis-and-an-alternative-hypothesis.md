    What is the difference between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis?
answer: >-
    The difference between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis is fundamental in statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.\n\n1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: This is a statement that posits there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables in the context of the study. It serves as the default or starting assumption that any observed effect in the data is due to random chance. For example, if you are testing a new drug, the null hypothesis might state that the drug has no effect on patients compared to a placebo.\n\n2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: This hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship between the variables being studied. Continuing with the drug example, the alternative hypothesis would state that the drug does have an effect on patients compared to a placebo.\n\nIn summary, the null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that there is an effect or difference. The purpose of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This process often involves calculating a p-value, which helps assess the significance of the results obtained from the data.
