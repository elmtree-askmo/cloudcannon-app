    What are the attitudes toward one's own minority group during the Resistance and Immersion Stage?
answer: >-
    During the Resistance and Immersion Stage of the Racial-cultural identity development (R-S-CID) model, individuals exhibit distinct attitudes toward their own minority group. This stage is characterized by the following key attitudes:\n\n1. **Positive Attitudes Toward Their Own Minority Group**: Individuals in this stage develop a strong sense of pride and appreciation for their own cultural identity. They embrace their heritage and often feel a deep connection to their community, which fosters a positive self-image and collective identity.\n\n2. **Conflicting Attitudes Toward Other Minority Groups**: While individuals may feel positively about their own group, they often experience ambivalence or conflicting feelings toward other minority groups. This can stem from a sense of competition or perceived differences in experiences and struggles among various minority groups.\n\n3. **Negative Attitudes Toward the Majority Group**: There is typically a strong skepticism or negative perception of the majority group during this stage. Individuals may view the majority as oppressive or dismissive of their cultural identity, leading to a sense of distrust and resistance against mainstream societal values.\n\n4. **Reluctance to Seek Therapy**: Due to a general suspicion of mental health services, individuals in this stage may be hesitant to seek therapy. They might feel that therapists from the majority group cannot understand their experiences or cultural context.\n\n5. **Preference for Therapists from Their Own Minority Group**: If therapy is sought, individuals are likely to prefer therapists who share their cultural background. They may believe that such therapists will have a better understanding of the impact of racism and their unique cultural experiences.\n\nOverall, the Resistance and Immersion Stage is marked by a strong affirmation of one's own cultural identity, a critical view of the majority group, and a complex relationship with other minority groups. This stage plays a crucial role in the broader process of identity development, as individuals navigate their cultural landscape and the psychological effects of racism.
