    What is the reminiscence bump and what age range does it typically cover?
answer: >-
    The reminiscence bump is a psychological phenomenon observed in older adults, characterized by their tendency to recall a disproportionately high number of significant life events that occurred during their late adolescence and early adulthood. This typically covers the age range of **15 to 25 years**. \n\nDuring this period, individuals experience numerous life transitions and identity-forming experiences, such as graduating from high school, starting college, or entering the workforce. These events are often emotionally intense and socially significant, which enhances their memorability and contributes to the reminiscence bump. The events recalled from this age range are crucial in shaping adult identity, making them particularly salient in memory retrieval later in life.\n\nIn summary, the reminiscence bump highlights the importance of the ages 15 to 25 in the context of memory retention and identity formation.
