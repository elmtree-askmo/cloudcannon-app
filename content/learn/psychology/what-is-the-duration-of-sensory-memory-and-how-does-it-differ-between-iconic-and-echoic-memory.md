    What is the duration of sensory memory, and how does it differ between iconic and echoic memory?
answer: >-
    Sensory memory is the initial stage of memory processing, where sensory information is briefly retained. It typically lasts only a few hundred milliseconds, allowing the brain to hold impressions of sensory stimuli after the original stimulus has ceased. This type of memory serves as a buffer for incoming sensory data from the five senses.\n\nThere are two primary types of sensory memory: iconic memory and echoic memory, which differ in both duration and capacity:\n\n1. **Iconic Memory**:\n   - **Definition**: This is the sensory memory for visual stimuli. It retains visual information for a very brief period.\n   - **Duration**: Iconic memory lasts approximately 0.5 seconds (or about 500 milliseconds).\n   - **Capacity**: It can preserve around 8-9 items of visual information.\n\n2. **Echoic Memory**:\n   - **Definition**: This is the sensory memory for auditory stimuli. It temporarily holds sounds, words, or melodies.\n   - **Duration**: Echoic memory lasts longer than iconic memory, typically around 2 to 4 seconds.\n   - **Capacity**: It can preserve about 4-5 items of auditory information.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between iconic and echoic memory are their duration and capacity, with iconic memory being shorter and capable of holding more items compared to echoic memory.
