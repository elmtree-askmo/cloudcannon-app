    What is a key advantage of using a between-subject design in clinical trials?
answer: >-
    A key advantage of using a between-subject design in clinical trials is its ability to effectively rule out alternative explanations for the observed effects. In this design, different participants are assigned to each condition or group, which allows researchers to compare outcomes across distinct groups. This randomization helps to minimize biases and confounding variables that could influence the results, thereby enhancing the internal validity of the study.\n\nAdditionally, between-subject designs are particularly useful when the effects of the treatment or intervention are expected to be long-lasting or when the treatment may have a carryover effect that could confound results if the same participants were used in multiple conditions (as in within-subject designs). By using separate groups, researchers can ensure that each participant's response is independent, which is crucial for accurately assessing the effectiveness of the intervention being tested. \n\nIn summary, the primary advantage of a between-subject design lies in its capacity to provide clearer insights into the causal relationships between interventions and outcomes by controlling for individual differences and external factors.
