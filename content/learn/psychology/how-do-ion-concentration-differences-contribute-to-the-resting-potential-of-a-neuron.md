    How do ion concentration differences contribute to the resting potential of a neuron?
answer: >-
    The resting potential of a neuron, typically around -70 millivolts (mV), is primarily established by the differences in ion concentrations across the neuronal membrane. This potential is crucial for the neuron's ability to generate action potentials and communicate effectively.\n\n### Key Factors Contributing to Resting Potential:\n\n1. **Ion Distribution**:\n   - The primary ions involved in establishing resting potential are sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-). \n   - There is a higher concentration of Na+ ions outside the neuron and a higher concentration of K+ ions inside the neuron. This unequal distribution creates a concentration gradient.\n\n2. **Electrostatic Pressure**:\n   - Electrostatic pressure refers to the forces that drive ions based on their charges. Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel. This pressure influences the movement of ions across the membrane.\n\n3. **Diffusion (Concentration Gradient)**:\n   - Ions tend to move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. For instance, Na+ ions would naturally diffuse into the neuron, while K+ ions would diffuse out. However, the resting potential is maintained despite these tendencies due to other mechanisms.\n\n4. **Sodium-Potassium Pump**:\n   - The sodium-potassium pump is a critical membrane protein that actively transports ions against their concentration gradients. It moves 3 Na+ ions out of the neuron and 2 K+ ions into the neuron. This active transport is essential for maintaining the resting potential and the overall ion balance within the neuron.\n   - The activity of the sodium-potassium pump contributes to the negative charge inside the neuron, as more positive charges (Na+) are expelled than are brought in (K+).\n\n### Summary:\nThe resting potential is a result of the combined effects of ion concentration differences, electrostatic pressure, diffusion, and the action of the sodium-potassium pump. This potential is vital for the neuron's ability to respond to stimuli and generate action potentials, which are necessary for neural communication. The maintenance of resting potential ensures that neurons are ready to transmit signals efficiently when activated.
