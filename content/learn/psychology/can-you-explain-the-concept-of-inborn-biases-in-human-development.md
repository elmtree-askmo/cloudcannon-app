    Can you explain the concept of inborn biases in human development?
answer: >-
    Inborn biases in human development refer to the built-in tendencies that infants possess, which influence how they respond to various stimuli and experiences from the moment they are born. These biases are considered to be universal to some extent, meaning that they are common across different cultures and populations. \n\nFor example, research has shown that infants are predisposed to respond positively to human faces and voices. Frequent exposure to the mother's voice during prenatal development, followed by the pairing of her voice with her face shortly after birth, can lead to a rapid development of visual preferences for human faces. This suggests that inborn biases facilitate selective attention to faces and voices, which are crucial for social interaction and bonding.\n\nHowever, there is ongoing debate regarding the nature of these biases. Some researchers argue that there is a specific mechanism in infants that is dedicated to detecting faces, while others propose that these preferences arise from domain-general attentional biases towards certain structural properties that are present in both faces and non-face objects. For instance, studies have indicated that by three months of age, infants show a clear preference for looking at faces, even when contrasted with scrambled face configurations, indicating that visual experience plays a significant role in shaping these preferences.\n\nIn summary, inborn biases are essential for understanding how infants engage with their environment and develop social skills. They highlight the interplay between innate tendencies and experiential learning in the early stages of human development.
