    How does neuropsychology provide access to deep brain regions compared to TMS?
answer: >-
    Neuropsychology provides access to deep brain regions in ways that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) cannot. The primary advantage of neuropsychology lies in its ability to assess and understand the effects of brain damage on cognitive functions, particularly in areas that are deep within the brain. Neuropsychologists evaluate individuals with brain injuries or neurological disorders, using standardized tests to assess various cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and language. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of how specific brain regions contribute to cognitive functions, even when those regions are not easily accessible through non-invasive stimulation techniques like TMS.\n\nIn contrast, TMS is limited to stimulating regions of the brain that are closer to the surface. While TMS can effectively disrupt normal brain activity in these accessible areas, it cannot reach deeper structures, which may be critical for understanding certain cognitive processes. This limitation means that TMS is less effective for studying the effects of damage in deep brain regions, where significant cognitive functions may be localized.\n\nMoreover, neuropsychology can provide insights into the functional specialization of different brain regions, as it often involves studying patients with specific brain lesions. For example, damage to the hippocampus can lead to memory formation impairments, illustrating how certain cognitive functions are localized to specific areas of the brain. This functional specialization is a key concept in neuropsychology that helps researchers understand the relationship between brain structure and cognitive abilities.\n\nIn summary, while TMS has its advantages in terms of experimental control and the ability to manipulate brain activity, neuropsychology excels in providing access to and understanding the implications of damage in deep brain regions, making it a valuable tool for studying the complexities of brain function and behavior.
