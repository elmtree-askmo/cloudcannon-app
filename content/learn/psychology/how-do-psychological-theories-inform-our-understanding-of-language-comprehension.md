    How do psychological theories inform our understanding of language comprehension?
answer: >-
    Psychological theories significantly inform our understanding of language comprehension by providing frameworks that elucidate the mental processes involved in understanding and producing language. Here are several key ways in which these theories contribute to our knowledge:\n\n1. **Theoretical Frameworks**: Cognitive psychology offers various models that explain how individuals process language. These models help researchers understand the mechanisms behind speech comprehension and production, including how people decode sounds, recognize words, and construct meaning from sentences. For instance, models such as the interactive activation model illustrate how visual and auditory information is integrated during language processing.\n\n2. **Mental Processes**: Cognitive psychology investigates the specific mental processes involved in language comprehension, such as attention, memory, and perception. Understanding how these processes interact allows researchers to identify the cognitive load involved in comprehending complex sentences or unfamiliar vocabulary.\n\n3. **Error Correction and Learning**: Theories in cognitive psychology explore how individuals learn to produce speech and correct errors.
