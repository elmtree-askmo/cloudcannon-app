    The Working Memory Model (WMM) describes short-term memory as a multi-component system including the Central Executive, Phonological Loop, Visuospatial Sketchpad, and recently added Episodic Buffer, essential for understanding cognitive processes.

    What are the components of the working memory model?
answer: >-
    The Working Memory Model (WMM), proposed by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch in 1974, describes short-term memory as a complex system composed of multiple components rather than a single unitary store. The original model consisted of three main components:\n\n1. **Central Executive**: This is the supervisory system that controls the flow of information between the other components. It is responsible for directing attention, integrating information from various sources, and managing cognitive tasks.\n\n2. **Phonological Loop**: This component is responsible for processing auditory information and consists of two parts:\n   - **Phonological Store**: This is a short-term store that holds auditory memory traces, which are subject to rapid decay.\n   - **Articulatory Rehearsal Component**: Also known as the articulatory loop, this part allows for the rehearsal of information to keep it in memory longer, effectively reviving the memory traces.\n\n3. **Visuospatial Sketchpad**: This component handles visual and spatial information, allowing for the manipulation and storage of visual data. It is essential for tasks that require visual imagery and spatial reasoning.\n\nIn later revisions of the model, Baddeley added a fourth component:\n\n4. **Episodic Buffer**: Introduced in 2000, this component serves as a temporary storage system that integrates information from the phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and long-term memory. It allows for the combination of different types of information into a coherent episode.\n\nThe WMM has been influential in understanding how we temporarily store and manipulate information, emphasizing the active role of working memory in cognitive processes.
