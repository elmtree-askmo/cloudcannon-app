    What are the key stages of Freud's psychosexual development theory?
answer: >-
    Freud's psychosexual development theory outlines five key stages through which personality develops during childhood. Each stage is characterized by a specific erogenous zone and associated psychological conflicts. Here are the stages:\n\n1. **Oral Stage (0-1.5 years)**: In this initial stage, the infant's pleasure centers on the mouth. Activities such as sucking and biting are crucial for the infant's development. Fixation at this stage can lead to oral fixation in adulthood, which may manifest as issues like dependency or aggression.\n\n2. **Anal Stage (1.5-3 years)**: During this stage, the focus shifts to bowel and bladder control. The child derives pleasure from controlling bodily functions. Successful navigation of this stage leads to a sense of autonomy, while fixation can result in anal-retentive (overly organized) or anal-expulsive (disorganized) personality traits.\n\n3. **Phallic Stage (3-6 years)**: The child's focus moves to the genitals, and they begin to identify with their same-sex parent. This stage introduces the Oedipus complex in boys and the Electra complex in girls, where children experience feelings of desire for the opposite-sex parent and rivalry with the same-sex parent. Fixation can lead to issues with authority and relationships in adulthood.\n\n4. **Latency Stage (6 years to puberty)**: In this stage, sexual feelings are repressed, and children focus on developing skills, friendships, and social interactions. This period is crucial for the development of communication and social skills.\n\n5. **Genital Stage (puberty onward)**: The final stage marks the maturation of sexual interests. Individuals develop a balance between various life areas, including love and work. Successful navigation of this stage leads to well-adjusted adults capable of forming healthy relationships.\n\nFreud's theory emphasizes that unresolved conflicts or fixations at any of these stages can lead to specific personality traits and issues in adulthood. Understanding these stages provides insight into the complexities of personality development and interpersonal relationships.
