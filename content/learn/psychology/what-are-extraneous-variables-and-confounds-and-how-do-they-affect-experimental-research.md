    What are extraneous variables and confounds, and how do they affect experimental research?
answer: >-
    Extraneous variables and confounding variables are critical concepts in experimental research, as they can significantly impact the validity and reliability of study outcomes.\n\n**Extraneous Variables**: These are any variables that are not the primary focus of a study but can still influence the dependent variable. They can introduce noise into the data, making it difficult to determine the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example, in a study examining the effects of a new teaching method on student performance, extraneous variables might include the students' prior knowledge, motivation levels, or even the time of day the test is administered. If not controlled, these variables can lead to skewed results and misinterpretations.\n\n**Confounding Variables**: A confounding variable is a specific type of extraneous variable that is related to both the independent and dependent variables. This means that it can provide alternative explanations for the observed effects, thus threatening the internal validity of the study. For instance, if researchers are studying the impact of a new medication on anxiety levels, a confounding variable could be the participants' baseline anxiety levels, which may differ across groups and influence the results. \n\nThe presence of confounding variables can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the relationship being studied. For example, if a study finds that a new teaching method improves student performance, but fails to account for the fact that students in the experimental group had higher prior knowledge (a confounding variable), the researchers might incorrectly attribute the improvement solely to the teaching method.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of extraneous and confounding variables, researchers can employ various strategies, such as randomization, matching, and statistical control. By carefully designing studies to account for these variables, researchers can enhance the internal validity of their experiments and draw more accurate conclusions about the relationships they are investigating.
