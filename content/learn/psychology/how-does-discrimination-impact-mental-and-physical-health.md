    How does discrimination impact mental and physical health?
answer: >-
    Discrimination has profound impacts on both mental and physical health, acting as a significant social determinant of health. Here are the key ways in which discrimination affects mental and physical well-being:\n\n1. **Chronic Stress and Anxiety**: Discrimination is a source of chronic stress, which can exacerbate mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Research indicates that individuals who experience discrimination report higher levels of stress, which can lead to long-term psychological distress (American Psychological Association, 2015). This stress can manifest in various ways, including increased anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n2. **Psychological Distress**: Numerous studies have established a positive correlation between perceived discrimination and psychological distress. For instance, perceived experiences of discrimination have been shown to predict psychiatric symptoms related to depression and anxiety more effectively than other factors such as age, gender, or socioeconomic status (Gaydosh et al.). The cumulative effects of discrimination can lead to a dose-response relationship, where increased exposure correlates with higher levels of emotional distress (Paradies et al., 2015).\n\n3. **Stigma and Loneliness**: Discrimination fosters stigma, leading to feelings of loneliness and social isolation. This is particularly pronounced among young people, who may experience stigma related to mental health disorders, negatively impacting their self-esteem and overall well-being (Wang et al., 2018).\n\n4. **Marginalization and Access to Resources**: Discrimination often results in marginalization, which can reduce access to essential societal resources and opportunities. This lack of access can exacerbate feelings of distress and contribute to mental health problems (Benner et al., 2018). For instance, individuals from minority groups may face barriers to quality mental health care, further compounding their mental health challenges.\n\n5. **Neural Processes**: Exposure to discrimination may affect mental health through neural processes associated with emotion expression and regulation. This indicates that the psychological effects of discrimination are not only social but also biological, potentially altering how individuals process emotions (Wickes et al., 2013).\n\n6. **Physical Health Outcomes**: The impact of discrimination is not limited to mental health; it also extends to physical health. Chronic stress from discrimination can lead to various physical health issues, including cardiovascular problems, weakened immune response, and other stress-related conditions. The interplay between mental and physical health is significant, as mental distress can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms, further impacting physical health.\n\nIn summary, discrimination significantly contributes to mental distress through mechanisms such as chronic stress, stigma, and reduced access to resources. Addressing discrimination is crucial for improving mental health outcomes and fostering social integration and well-being.
