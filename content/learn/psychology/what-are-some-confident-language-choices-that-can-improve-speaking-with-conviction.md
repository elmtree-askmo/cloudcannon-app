    What are some confident language choices that can improve speaking with conviction?
answer: >-
    To improve speaking with conviction, confident language choices are essential. Here are some strategies based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Use Decisive Language**: Choose words that convey certainty and assertiveness. Avoid phrases that express doubt, such as "I think" or "maybe." Instead, use definitive statements like "I believe" or "It is clear that."\n\n2. **Avoid Hesitant Phrases**: Steer clear of filler words such as "um," "like," or "you know." These can undermine your authority and make you sound uncertain. Practice speaking clearly and directly.\n\n3. **Embrace the Power of Pauses**: Strategic pauses can enhance your message. They allow your audience to absorb what you've said and create anticipation for what comes next. This technique can make your speech more impactful.\n\n4. **Speak with Conviction**: The manner of speaking is as important as the content. Use confident language and avoid upward inflections at the end of sentences, which can make statements sound like questions. This helps in sounding more decisive.\n\n5. **Use Open and Expansive Gestures**: Your body language should match your words. Open gestures can reinforce your message and draw the audience in, making your communication more engaging.\n\n6. **Master Eye Contact**: Maintain eye contact for 3 to 5 seconds with your audience. This shows confidence and helps establish a connection without coming across as intimidating.\n\n7. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**: Composure in stressful situations communicates control and capability. Practicing calmness can help you maintain confidence in your speech.\n\nBy incorporating these confident language choices and techniques into your communication, you can significantly enhance your ability to speak with conviction and authority.
