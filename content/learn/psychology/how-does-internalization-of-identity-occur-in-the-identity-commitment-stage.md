    How does internalization of identity occur in the identity commitment stage?
answer: >-
    In Troidon's model of gay and lesbian identity development, the identity commitment stage is crucial for the internalization of identity. This stage represents a significant transition where individuals solidify their sexual orientation as a core aspect of their self-concept. Here’s how internalization occurs during this stage:\n\n1. **Integration of Identity**: During the identity commitment stage, individuals begin to integrate their sexual orientation into their overall identity. This means that their sexual orientation is no longer seen as a separate or secondary aspect of who they are, but rather as a fundamental part of their self-concept. This integration is often facilitated by positive experiences and affirmations from their social environment.\n\n2. **Affirmation and Acceptance**: Individuals in this stage typically experience a strong sense of affirmation regarding their sexual orientation. They have moved past confusion and are now comfortable with their identity. This acceptance is often reinforced by supportive relationships and communities that validate their experiences and identity.\n\n3. **Social Relationships**: The internalization of identity is also influenced by social relationships. As individuals commit to their sexual orientation, they often seek out and build relationships with others who share similar identities. This creates a sense of belonging and community, which further solidifies their identity.\n\n4. **Public Presentation**: In the identity commitment stage, individuals may begin to present their sexual orientation more openly in various social contexts. This public affirmation of their identity can reinforce their internal sense of self and contribute to a more stable and positive self-image.\n\n5. **Resilience Against Stigma**: As individuals internalize their identity, they often develop resilience against societal stigma and discrimination. This resilience is rooted in a strong sense of self and the understanding that their sexual orientation is a valid and important part of who they are.\n\n6. **Long-term Commitment**: Finally, the identity commitment stage involves a long-term commitment to one’s sexual orientation. This commitment is characterized by a willingness to advocate for oneself and others within the LGBTQ+ community, further embedding the identity into their life narrative.\n\nIn summary, the internalization of identity during the identity commitment stage is a multifaceted process that involves the integration of sexual orientation into the self-concept, affirmation through social relationships, public presentation, resilience against stigma, and a long-term commitment to one's identity. This stage is essential for fostering a positive self-identity and enhancing overall psychological well-being.
