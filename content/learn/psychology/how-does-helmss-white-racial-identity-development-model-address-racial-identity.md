    How does Helms's White Racial Identity Development Model address racial identity?
answer: >-
    Helms's White Racial Identity Development (WRID) Model is a significant framework for understanding how White individuals develop their racial identity, particularly in the context of systemic racism and white supremacy. The model outlines a continuum of six sequential stages that individuals may experience as they navigate their racial identity:\n\n1. **Contact**: In this initial stage, individuals are largely oblivious to their own racial identity and the implications of being White in a racially stratified society.\n\n2. **Disintegration**: Here, individuals begin to acknowledge their White identity and the existence of racial issues, often experiencing discomfort as they confront the realities of racism.\n\n3. **Reintegration**: This stage is characterized by a defensive reaction where individuals may accept the belief in White superiority and view non-Whites as inferior. They may struggle with their own racial identity and the implications of their privilege.\n\n4. **Pseudo-Independent**: At this point, individuals start to intellectually accept their own racial identity and that of others, but their understanding may still be superficial and not fully integrated into their personal beliefs.\n\n5. **Immersion/Emersion**: Individuals actively seek to understand their racial identity and the experiences of people of color. They may engage in deeper self-examination and begin to reject racist beliefs and behaviors.\n\n6. **Autonomy**: In the final stage, individuals develop a strong, positive sense of their racial identity that is anti-racist. They are knowledgeable about racial, ethnic, and cultural differences and value diversity, feeling comfortable in multiracial settings.\n\nHelms's model emphasizes that racial identity development is not a linear process; individuals may move back and forth between stages and may not experience all stages. The model also highlights the importance of ongoing self-examination and openness to new information, which is crucial for developing a non-racist identity.\n\nThe White Racial Identity Attitude Scale (WRIAS) is a tool associated with this model, designed to measure attitudes reflecting the various stages of White racial identity development. While the WRIAS has been widely used in research, it has faced critiques regarding its psychometric properties and the correspondence between the scale and Helms's stages.\n\nOverall, Helms's WRID model provides a framework for understanding the complexities of White racial identity and its implications for counseling, interpersonal dynamics, and broader societal issues related to race and privilege.
