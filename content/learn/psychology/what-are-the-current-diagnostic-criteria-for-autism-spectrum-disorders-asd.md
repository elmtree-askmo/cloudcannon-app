    What are the current diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)?
answer: >-
    The current diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013. The DSM-5 introduced significant changes to the classification and diagnosis of autism, consolidating previously separate diagnoses such as Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) into a single diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, the criteria for diagnosing ASD include:\n\n1. **Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction** across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following:\n   - Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (e.g., failure to engage in back-and-forth conversation, reduced sharing of interests or emotions).\n   - Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (e.g., poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, lack of eye contact).\n   - Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g., difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts, lack of interest in peers).\n\n2. **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities**, as manifested by at least two of the following:\n   - Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypes, echolalia).\n   - Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes).\n   - Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to unusual objects).\n   - Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds).\n\n3. **Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period**, although they may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities.\n\n4. **Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.\n\n5. **These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay**. Intellectual disability and ASD frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of ASD and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.\n\nThe DSM-5 also emphasizes the importance of specifying the severity of the disorder, which can range from requiring support to requiring very substantial support.\n\nThese criteria reflect a comprehensive understanding of autism and aim to provide a more accurate diagnosis that can guide effective interventions and support for individuals on the autism spectrum.
