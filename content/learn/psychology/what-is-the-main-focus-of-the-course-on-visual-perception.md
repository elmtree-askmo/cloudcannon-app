    What is the main focus of the course on visual perception?
answer: >-
    The main focus of the course on visual perception is to explore how the visual system generates what we see and to understand the underlying mechanisms of visual perception in relation to brain function. The course is structured around three primary units: \n\n1. **Low-Level Visual Processing**: This unit covers fundamental aspects of visual perception, including depth, color, and motion processing.\n2. **Visual Attention**: This section examines how attention influences what we perceive visually.\n3. **Higher-Level Visual Processing**: This unit delves into more complex processes such as visual memory, face and object recognition, and visual mental imagery.\n\nThe course draws on evidence from various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, the history of vision science, and philosophy, to provide a comprehensive understanding of visual perception. Additionally, students are encouraged to engage in practical applications by designing experiments related to visual perception, which constitutes a significant portion of their final assessment.\n\nOverall, the course emphasizes the importance of visual perception skills in navigating the world and understanding visual information, highlighting its relevance in both theoretical and practical contexts.
