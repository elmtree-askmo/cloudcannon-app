    How does consultee-centered case consultation differ from client-centered case consultation?
answer: >-
    Consultee-centered case consultation and client-centered case consultation differ primarily in their focus and goals.\n\n1. **Focus**:\n   - **Consultee-Centered Case Consultation**: This type of consultation emphasizes the consultee's (the professional seeking help) difficulties in managing a specific client case. The focus is on enhancing the consultee's skills, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities. The primary goal is to address the deficits in the consultee's functioning that hinder effective case management, making client improvement a secondary concern.\n   - **Client-Centered Case Consultation**: In contrast, this approach centers on the clientâ€™s needs and concerns. The evaluation and recommendations are directed towards understanding and addressing the specific issues faced by the client. The primary goal is to develop a plan that directly benefits the client, ensuring that their needs are met through appropriate interventions.\n\n2. **Goals**:\n   - **Consultee-Centered Case Consultation**: The main objective is to improve the consultee's capacity to handle current and future cases effectively. This may involve re-conceptualizing the consultee's approach to their work problems and enhancing their professional functioning.\n   - **Client-Centered Case Consultation**: The goal here is to provide tailored recommendations and interventions that directly address the client's situation, thereby facilitating their improvement and well-being.\n\nIn summary, while consultee-centered case consultation focuses on the professional development of the consultee to better manage client cases, client-centered case consultation prioritizes the needs and improvement of the client themselves.
