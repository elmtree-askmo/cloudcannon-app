    What are the primary functions of EEG and ERP in measuring brain activity?
answer: >-
    Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-Related Potentials (ERP) are two prominent techniques used to measure brain activity, each with distinct functions and applications.\n\n### EEG (Electroencephalography)\n- **Mechanism**: EEG records electrical activity in the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. It captures the electrical signals produced by neuronal activity, providing a continuous record of brain function.\n- **Temporal Resolution**: EEG has excellent temporal resolution, allowing it to track brain activity in real-time, with measurements taken in milliseconds. This makes it particularly useful for studying the dynamics of brain activity during cognitive tasks.\n- **Spatial Resolution**: While EEG excels in temporal resolution, it has lower spatial resolution compared to other imaging techniques like fMRI. This limitation makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact source of electrical activity within the brain.\n- **Applications**: EEG is widely used in research on cognitive processes, sleep studies, and epilepsy monitoring, where understanding the timing of brain activity is crucial.\n\n### ERP (Event-Related Potentials)\n- **Mechanism**: ERP is derived from EEG data and focuses on time-locked brain responses to specific stimuli or events. By averaging the EEG signals over multiple trials, researchers can isolate the brain's response to a particular stimulus.\n- **Temporal Resolution**: Like EEG, ERP also boasts high temporal resolution, enabling researchers to measure brain responses with millisecond precision. This allows for detailed analysis of cognitive processes, such as attention and perception.\n- **Applications**: ERP is particularly valuable in cognitive neuroscience for investigating how quickly and effectively the brain responds to sensory inputs, such as visual or auditory stimuli. It provides insights into cognitive processing speed and the timing of neural events associated with specific tasks.\n\n### Summary\nBoth EEG and ERP are essential tools in neuroscience, offering high temporal resolution that is critical for studying the timing of cognitive processes. While EEG provides a continuous record of brain activity, ERP focuses on specific, time-locked responses to stimuli, making them complementary methods for understanding brain function and cognitive processes.
