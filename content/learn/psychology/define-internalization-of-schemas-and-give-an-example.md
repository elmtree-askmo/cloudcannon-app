    Internalization of schemas is the sixth substage of the sensorimotor stage in child development, where infants develop mental representations of reality, allowing them to solve problems mentally and engage in symbolic thought, as seen in make-believe play.

    Define internalization of schemas and give an example.
answer: >-
    The internalization of schemas is the sixth and final substage of the sensorimotor stage, occurring from 18 to 24 months of age. During this period, infants develop mental representations of reality, which allows them to solve problems mentally rather than through direct interaction. This cognitive advancement marks the emergence of representational thought, enabling children to understand symbols and think about objects and events that are not present.\n\nAn example of internalization of schemas can be seen when a child begins to engage in make-believe play. For instance, a child might use a banana as a pretend phone, demonstrating their ability to represent an object (the banana) as something else (a phone). This ability to use symbols indicates that the child has internalized schemas and can think abstractly about objects and their functions, even when those objects are not physically present.
