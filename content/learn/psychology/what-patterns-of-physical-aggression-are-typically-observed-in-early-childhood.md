    What patterns of physical aggression are typically observed in early childhood?
answer: >-
    In early childhood, patterns of physical aggression are typically observed to be more prevalent among boys compared to girls. Research indicates that boys are more likely to engage in physical aggression from as early as two years old. This trend is consistent across various studies, highlighting a significant difference in the expression of aggression between genders during early developmental stages.\n\nOn the other hand, findings regarding relational aggression, which involves harming social relationships rather than using physical force, are less consistent. Some studies suggest that girls may engage in relational aggression more frequently, while others find no significant differences or indicate that boys may engage in it as well.\n\nOverall, the evidence points to a clear pattern where physical aggression is predominantly exhibited by boys in early childhood, while the dynamics of relational aggression remain more complex and variable across different studies. \n\nReferences for these findings include works by Merrill, Buchanan, and Tran (2006) and Bulgaria and Pequino (2015).
