    How does semantic memory differ from episodic memory?
answer: >-
    Semantic memory and episodic memory are two distinct types of long-term memory that serve different functions in our cognitive processes.\n\n**Episodic Memory** is characterized by the ability to recall specific events or experiences from one's life. It is deeply personal and often tied to emotions, context, and the details of when and where an event occurred. For example, remembering your first day at school or a family vacation involves episodic memory, as these memories are anchored in specific contexts and personal experiences. Each individual's episodic memory of an event is unique, shaped by their perceptions and emotional responses.\n\n**Semantic Memory**, on the other hand, refers to our general knowledge about the world, including facts, concepts, and meanings that are not linked to specific personal experiences. It encompasses information such as knowing that Paris is the capital of France or that a dog is a type of animal. Semantic memory is abstract and does not rely on the context in which the information was learned; it is more about the understanding of concepts and facts rather than the recollection of personal experiences.\n\nThe distinction between these two types of memory was first proposed by Endel Tulving in 1972. While episodic memory is context-dependent and tied to personal events, semantic memory provides a framework of generalized knowledge that is independent of specific experiences. Despite their differences, episodic and semantic memory are interrelated and can influence each other; for instance, integrating semantic knowledge can enhance the recall of episodic memories.\n\nIn summary, the key differences are:\n- **Episodic Memory**: Personal, context-specific, tied to emotions and experiences.\n- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge, abstract, not tied to specific events or personal context.
