    Describe the stages of pre-conventional morality in Colberg's theory.
answer: >-
    In Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, pre-conventional morality represents the first level, which is primarily focused on self-interest and the consequences of actions. This level consists of two distinct stages:\n\n1. **Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience Orientation**\n   - In this stage, moral reasoning is based on the avoidance of punishment. Individuals judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences, particularly whether it leads to punishment. The emphasis is on obedience to authority and the understanding that actions are wrong if they result in punishment.\n\n2. **Stage 2: Instrumental Hedonism**\n   - At this stage, moral judgments are guided by personal needs and the pursuit of rewards. Actions are considered acceptable if they satisfy individual desires or lead to personal gain. This stage reflects a more pragmatic approach to morality, where the focus is on the benefits that can be derived from actions rather than on any broader social or ethical considerations.\n\nOverall, pre-conventional morality is characterized by a self-centered perspective, where moral reasoning is primarily concerned with the immediate consequences of actions rather than societal norms or ethical principles.
