    What is the spreading activation model in semantic memory?
answer: >-
    The spreading activation model, developed by Collins and Loftus in 1975, is a significant theory in the field of semantic memory. It addresses some of the limitations of earlier models, such as the Hierarchical Network Model (HNM) and the TLC (Teachable Language Comprehender) model. The core idea of the spreading activation model is that concepts in our memory are represented as nodes within a network, and these nodes are interconnected through various links that represent the relationships between the concepts.\n\nWhen a particular node (or concept) is activated—whether through perception, thought, or recall—activation spreads outwards to related nodes in the network. This process is akin to a diffusion or random walk, where the activation travels along the links connecting the nodes. The strength of the activation spreading from one node to another depends on the "conductivity" of the link, which is influenced by the frequency and strength of the associations between the concepts. The more frequently two concepts are linked, the stronger the connection, and thus the faster the activation spreads.\n\nThis model is particularly relevant in explaining the priming effect, where exposure to one concept can facilitate the retrieval of related concepts. For example, if a person hears the word "bread," the activation may spread to related concepts such as "butter," "toast," or "sandwich," making it easier to recall information associated with these terms.\n\nThe spreading activation model also accounts for the phenomenon of cognitive economy, where more closely related concepts are activated more quickly than those that are more distantly related. This allows for efficient retrieval of information from memory, as the brain can quickly access a network of associated ideas.\n\nIn summary, the spreading activation model provides a framework for understanding how information is organized and retrieved in semantic memory, illustrating the dynamic and interconnected nature of our cognitive processes.
