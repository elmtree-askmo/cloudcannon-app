    What is the difference between distal and proximal in anatomical terminology?
answer: >-
    In anatomical terminology, the terms "distal" and "proximal" are used to describe the location of structures in relation to a specific point of reference, typically the trunk of the body or the point of attachment of a limb.\n\n- **Proximal** refers to structures that are closer to the point of attachment or the trunk. For example, the elbow is proximal to the wrist, meaning it is closer to the bodyâ€™s trunk than the wrist is.\n\n- **Distal**, on the other hand, refers to structures that are farther away from the point of attachment or the trunk. For instance, the fingers are distal to the wrist, indicating that they are farther from the trunk than the wrist.\n\nThese terms are essential for accurately describing the anatomical features and their relationships within the body, helping to avoid confusion in medical and biological contexts. Understanding the distinction between proximal and distal is particularly important in fields such as medicine, physical therapy, and anatomy.
