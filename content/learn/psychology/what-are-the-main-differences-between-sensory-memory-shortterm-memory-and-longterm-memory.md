    What are the main differences between sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory?
answer: >-
    The main differences between sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Sensory Memory\n- **Definition**: Sensory memory is the initial stage of memory that holds sensory information for a very brief period, typically less than a second for visual stimuli (iconic memory) and a few seconds for auditory stimuli (echoic memory).\n- **Function**: Its primary purpose is to provide a buffer for stimuli received through the senses, allowing the brain to process incoming sensations and perceive the world as a continuous stream of events rather than isolated pieces.\n- **Duration**: Very short, usually lasting only milliseconds to a few seconds.\n- **Capacity**: High capacity, as it can hold a large amount of information from the senses, but this information is fleeting and not consciously processed unless attention is directed towards it.\n\n### Short-Term Memory\n- **Definition**: Short-term memory (often referred to as working memory) is the stage where information is temporarily held for processing and manipulation. It is where conscious thought occurs.\n- **Function**: It allows individuals to hold and work with a limited amount of information (typically 7Â±2 items) for a short duration, which is essential for tasks such as problem-solving and reasoning.\n- **Duration**: Information can be retained for about 15 to 30 seconds without rehearsal.\n- **Capacity**: Limited capacity, which can be expanded through techniques such as chunking (grouping information into larger units).\n\n### Long-Term Memory\n- **Definition**: Long-term memory is the stage where information is stored for extended periods, ranging from days to decades. It encompasses both explicit (declarative) and implicit (non-declarative) memories.\n- **Function**: It is responsible for the storage of knowledge, experiences, and skills, allowing individuals to recall information over long periods.\n- **Duration**: Potentially unlimited duration, as information can be retained for a lifetime.\n- **Capacity**: Considered to have an unlimited capacity, as it can store vast amounts of information.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, sensory memory acts as a brief holding area for sensory information, short-term memory allows for the active processing of information for immediate use, and long-term memory serves as a vast repository for information that can be recalled over extended periods. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping how memory functions and how information is processed in the brain.
