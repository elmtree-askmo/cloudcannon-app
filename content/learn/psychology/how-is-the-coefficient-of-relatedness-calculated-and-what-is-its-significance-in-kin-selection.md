    How is the coefficient of relatedness calculated and what is its significance in kin selection?
answer: >-
    The coefficient of relatedness (R) is a crucial concept in evolutionary biology, particularly in the study of kin selection and altruism. It quantifies the genetic relatedness between individuals, ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no genetic relationship, while a value of 1 indicates that the individuals are genetically identical. \n\n### Calculation of the Coefficient of Relatedness\n\nThe coefficient of relatedness can be calculated based on the genetic relationships between individuals. Here are some common values:\n\n- **Siblings**: R = 0.5 (approximately 50% of genes shared)\n- **Parents and offspring**: R = 0.5\n- **Grandparents and grandchildren**: R = 0.25\n- **Aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews**: R = 0.25\n- **First cousins**: R = 0.125\n\nThe calculation is often derived from the concept of common ancestry, where the coefficient reflects the probability that a gene in one individual is also present in another individual due to inheritance from a common ancestor.\n\n### Significance in Kin Selection\n\nThe coefficient of relatedness is significant in the context of kin selection, which is a form of natural selection that favors behaviors that benefit relatives, even at a cost to the individual performing the behavior. This is particularly relevant in the study of altruism, where an individual may sacrifice its own reproductive success to enhance the survival and reproductive success of its relatives.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed using the formula:\n\n$$\nvr - c > 0\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ v $ = benefit to the recipient of the altruistic act\n- $ r $ = coefficient of relatedness\n- $ c $ = cost to the altruist\n\nThis formula indicates that altruistic behavior is favored when the benefit to the recipient, multiplied by the degree of relatedness, exceeds the cost to the altruist. In essence, individuals are more likely to engage in altruistic behaviors towards those with whom they share a higher coefficient of relatedness, as this increases the likelihood of passing on shared genes to future generations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the coefficient of relatedness is a fundamental measure in understanding genetic relationships and the evolutionary strategies that underpin altruistic behavior in animals. It helps explain why individuals may act in ways that seem self-sacrificial, as these actions can ultimately enhance the survival and reproductive success of their genetic relatives, thereby contributing to the propagation of shared genes.
