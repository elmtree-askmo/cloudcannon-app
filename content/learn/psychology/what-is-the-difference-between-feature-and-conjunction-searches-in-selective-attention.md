    What is the difference between feature and conjunction searches in selective attention?
answer: >-
    The difference between feature and conjunction searches in selective attention primarily revolves around the number of attributes used to define the target and the complexity of the search process.\n\n### Feature Search\n- **Definition**: A feature search involves looking for a target defined by a single attribute, such as color, shape, or motion. \n- **Processing Speed**: This type of search is typically fast and automatic due to the "pop-out" effect, where the target stands out from the distractors. For example, if you are searching for a green square among red squares, the green square will quickly capture your attention.\n- **Cognitive Load**: Feature searches require less cognitive effort, as the visual system can process single features rapidly and efficiently.\n\n### Conjunction Search\n- **Definition**: A conjunction search requires identifying a target based on a combination of two or more features. For instance, finding a red square among blue squares and red circles involves attending to both color and shape.\n- **Processing Speed**: This search is generally slower and more complex because it necessitates the integration of multiple features. The individual must examine each item to determine if it matches the target's combined features.\n- **Cognitive Load**: Conjunction searches demand more attention and processing resources, as they require focused attention to evaluate multiple characteristics simultaneously.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Target Definition**: Feature search uses a single feature, while conjunction search uses multiple features.\n- **Search Speed**: Feature search is faster due to the pop-out effect, whereas conjunction search is slower due to the need for feature integration.\n- **Cognitive Processing**: Feature search requires less cognitive effort compared to conjunction search, which demands more attention and processing resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the key distinction between feature search and conjunction search lies in the number of features used to define the target and the resulting efficiency of the search process.
