    What are the primary differences between gray matter and white matter in the brain?
answer: >-
    The primary differences between gray matter and white matter in the brain can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Location**:\n   - **Gray Matter**: In the brain, gray matter is located on the outer surface, forming the cerebral cortex. In contrast, in the spinal cord, gray matter is found in the center, resembling a butterfly shape.\n   - **White Matter**: White matter is found beneath the gray matter in the brain and surrounds the gray matter in the spinal cord.\n\n2. **Composition**:\n   - **Gray Matter**: It is primarily composed of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses. This structure is crucial for processing and integrating information.\n   - **White Matter**: It consists mainly of myelinated axons, which are long projections of neurons that transmit signals over distances. The myelin sheath, which is rich in lipids, gives white matter its characteristic color and acts as insulation, enhancing the speed and efficiency of electrical signal transmission.\n\n3. **Function**:\n   - **Gray Matter**: It is involved in processing information, including sensory perception, muscle control, and higher cognitive functions such as decision-making and memory.\n   - **White Matter**: Its primary role is to facilitate communication between different brain regions and between the brain and spinal cord, allowing for the rapid transmission of signals.\n\n4. **Appearance**:\n   - **Gray Matter**: Appears darker due to the presence of cell bodies and the lack of myelin.\n   - **White Matter**: Appears lighter because of the myelinated axons.\n\nIn summary, gray matter is essential for processing and integrating information, while white matter is crucial for communication between different parts of the nervous system.
