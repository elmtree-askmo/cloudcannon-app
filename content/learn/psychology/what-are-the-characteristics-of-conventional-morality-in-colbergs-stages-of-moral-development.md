    What are the characteristics of conventional morality in Colberg's stages of moral development?
answer: >-
    In Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, conventional morality represents the second level of moral reasoning, which is characterized by two distinct stages:\n\n### Stage 3: Good Boy/Good Girl Orientation\n- **Social Approval**: In this stage, individuals make moral decisions based on the desire to gain approval from others. Actions are considered right if they are perceived as good by the majority or by significant others, such as family and friends.\n- **Interpersonal Relationships**: The focus is on maintaining relationships and fulfilling social roles. Individuals in this stage are motivated by the need to be seen as a "good person" and to conform to social expectations.\n\n### Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation\n- **Adherence to Rules**: At this stage, moral reasoning is based on the understanding and adherence to laws and rules. Individuals believe that maintaining social order is essential for the well-being of society.\n- **Authority and Duty**: Actions are judged as right or wrong based on their alignment with established laws and the duties one has to society. There is a strong emphasis on the importance of authority and the necessity of following rules to ensure societal stability.\n\n### Summary of Characteristics\n- **Social Perspective**: Conventional morality emphasizes the importance of social relationships and the expectations of others in moral reasoning.\n- **Conformity**: Individuals are motivated by a desire to conform to societal norms and values, seeking approval and acceptance from their peers and authority figures.\n- **Rule-Following**: There is a strong focus on the importance of laws and rules as guiding principles for moral behavior, reflecting a commitment to maintaining social order.\n\nOverall, conventional morality is marked by a shift from self-centered reasoning (as seen in pre-conventional morality) to a more socially oriented perspective, where the individual's actions are evaluated based on their impact on relationships and societal norms.
