    According to Schachter's two-factor theory, how do situational cues influence the labeling of emotions?
answer: >-
    According to Schachter's two-factor theory, situational cues play a crucial role in the labeling of emotions. This theory posits that emotions arise from two key components: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. When an individual experiences physiological arousal, such as an increased heart rate or sweating, they then look to the surrounding context or situational cues to determine what emotion they are feeling.\n\nFor example, if a person feels their heart racing while watching a horror movie, they may interpret that physiological response as fear due to the context of the situation. Conversely, if the same physiological arousal occurs while watching a thrilling sports event, they might label it as excitement instead. Thus, the specific emotion experienced is influenced by the interpretation of the physiological state in light of the situational cues present at that moment.\n\nIn summary, situational cues help individuals make sense of their physiological arousal, leading to the labeling of emotions based on the context in which the arousal occurs. This highlights the interplay between physiological responses and cognitive processes in emotional experiences.
