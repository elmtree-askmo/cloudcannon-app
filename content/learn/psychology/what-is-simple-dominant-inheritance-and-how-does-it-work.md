    What is simple dominant inheritance and how does it work?
answer: >-
    Simple dominant inheritance is a genetic inheritance pattern characterized by the presence of two distinct alleles for a single trait: one dominant and one recessive. This concept is rooted in Mendelian genetics, which was established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants in the 19th century.\n\nIn simple dominant inheritance, the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele when both are present in an individual. The dominant allele is typically represented by a capital letter (e.g., "A"), while the recessive allele is denoted by a lowercase letter (e.g., "a"). The possible combinations of alleles that an offspring can inherit from its parents are:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (AA)\n- Heterozygous (Aa)\n- Homozygous recessive (aa)\n\nIndividuals with either the homozygous dominant (AA) or heterozygous (Aa) genotype will express the dominant trait phenotypically, while only those with the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) will express the recessive trait.\n\nFor example, if brown eyes (B) are dominant over blue eyes (b), a person with genotypes BB or Bb will have brown eyes, while only a person with the genotype bb will have blue eyes. This illustrates how the presence of a single dominant allele can determine the observable characteristics of an organism.\n\nIt's important to note that while simple dominance is a fundamental concept in genetics, it does not encompass all inheritance patterns. Other modes of inheritance, such as co-dominance and incomplete dominance, also exist and can influence how traits are expressed in various organisms.
