    How do friendships evolve during adolescence?
answer: >-
    During adolescence, friendships undergo significant evolution, marked by changes in quality, depth, and the nature of interactions. As adolescents transition from childhood, their peer relationships become increasingly important, reflecting a shift towards spending more time with same-age friends (Larson & Richards, 1991). This period is characterized by a deepening of friendships, where levels of commitment, intimacy, and acceptance of differences among friends grow (Berndt & Savin-Williams, 1993; Buhrmester, 1990).\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this evolution. Firstly, the rapid brain development occurring during adolescence enhances cognitive capabilities, allowing for more complex social interactions and emotional understanding. Adolescents begin to form identities that are separate from their parents, which fosters a desire for autonomy and self-discovery through friendships (Güroğlu et al., 2014). Friendships during this time are often egalitarian, defined as voluntary and positive bonds between individuals.\n\nAs adolescents mature, they exhibit increased prosocial behaviors such as giving, sharing, and trusting their friends, which helps them differentiate between close friends and other peers (Güroğlu et al., 2014). The quality of friendships becomes crucial, as supportive and high-quality friendships are linked to positive developmental outcomes and mental health, both in the short and long term (Steinberg, 2014). These friendships provide companionship, emotional support, and a sense of belonging, which are vital as adolescents navigate the complexities of their social worlds.\n\nMoreover, friendships play a critical role in helping adolescents cope with stress and navigate difficult situations. They learn important social skills, such as conflict resolution and empathy, which are essential for healthy functioning and positive peer relationships (Lansford et al., 2003). However, the influence of social media can complicate these dynamics, offering both opportunities for connection and potential negative impacts on friendship quality.\n\nIn summary, friendships during adolescence evolve to become more intimate and supportive, significantly impacting social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. This developmental stage emphasizes the importance of peer relationships in fostering resilience and personal growth.
