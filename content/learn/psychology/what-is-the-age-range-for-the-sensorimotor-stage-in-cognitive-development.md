    What is the age range for the sensorimotor stage in cognitive development?
answer: >-
    In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the sensorimotor stage occurs from birth to approximately two years of age. This stage is crucial as it marks the period when infants learn about their environment primarily through sensory experiences and motor actions. \n\nThe sensorimotor stage is further divided into six substages, which illustrate the progression of cognitive abilities from reflexive reactions to more intentional and complex behaviors, including the development of object permanence. This stage lays the foundation for later cognitive development, as infants begin to form mental representations and engage in activities such as make-believe play and symbolic play as they grow older.
