    What are the primary reflexes observed in newborns?
answer: >-
    Newborns exhibit several primary reflexes that are crucial for their survival and development. These reflexes are involuntary muscle responses to specific stimuli and are typically present at birth. Here are some of the key reflexes observed in newborns:\n\n1. **Rooting Reflex**: This reflex occurs when the corner of the baby's mouth is stroked or touched. It helps the baby turn their head toward the stimulus and is essential for breastfeeding.\n\n2. **Sucking Reflex**: This reflex is triggered when something touches the roof of the baby's mouth. It develops before birth and is vital for feeding.\n\n3. **Moro Reflex (Startle Reflex)**: This reflex is characterized by the baby spreading their arms and legs when startled by a loud noise or sudden movement. It typically lasts until the baby is about 2 months old.\n\n4. **Palmar Grasp Reflex**: When an object is placed in the baby's palm, they will grasp it tightly. This reflex usually disappears by 5 to 6 months of age.\n\n5. **Tonic Neck Reflex**: This reflex occurs when the baby turns their head to one side, causing the arm on that side to extend while the opposite arm bends. It typically lasts until about 2 months of age.\n\n6. **Babinski Reflex**: When the sole of the baby's foot is stroked, the toes will fan out and then curl. This reflex usually disappears by 12 months of age.\n\n7. **Galant Reflex**: This reflex is observed when the baby is held face down and the skin along one side of the spine is stroked, causing the baby to curve their body toward that side.\n\n8. **Stepping Reflex**: When the baby is held upright with their feet touching a flat surface, they will make stepping motions. This reflex typically disappears by 2 months of age.\n\nThese reflexes are important indicators of a newborn's neurological development and health. They generally diminish as the child grows, with most disappearing by the first year of life. If a newborn does not exhibit these reflexes or shows asymmetry, it may warrant further evaluation by a healthcare professional.
