    How do interviewers typically react following a "Don't Know" response from a child?
answer: >-
    When children provide a "Don't know" response during forensic interviews, interviewers typically react in a few notable ways. Research indicates that interviewers reject these responses nearly 30% of the time. This rejection can be either implicit or explicit, with 22% of rejections being implicit and 7% explicit. Following a "Don't know" response, interviewers often continue to ask about the same topic but may employ more risky or leading questions. \n\nInterestingly, when interviewers press for further information after a "Don't know" response, children frequently change their subsequent answers. In fact, in 81% of cases where interviewers rejected a "Don't know" response, children provided a different response afterward. This suggests that the pressure to answer can lead children to provide information even when they initially indicated a lack of knowledge.\n\nMoreover, studies have shown that while pre-interview instructions encouraging children to say "I don't know" when appropriate do not significantly increase the frequency of such responses, they can influence how children respond to follow-up questions. The dynamics of these interactions highlight the importance of interviewer techniques and the potential implications for the accuracy of children's testimonies in forensic settings. \n\nOverall, the way interviewers handle "Don't know" responses can significantly impact the quality and reliability of the information obtained from child witnesses.
