    How is alcoholism defined as a disability under the ADA?
answer: >-
    Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), alcoholism can be defined as a disability when it substantially limits one or more major life activities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recognizes that an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD) may qualify for protection under the ADA if they meet the definition of "disability." \n\nA person is considered to have a disability under the ADA if they have a physical or mental impairment that significantly restricts their ability to perform major life activities, which include walking, seeing, learning, working, and caring for oneself. Alcoholism is recognized as a condition that can impair these activities due to its effects on a person's brain and neurological functions.\n\nImportantly, the ADA provides protections for individuals who are in recovery from alcoholism, meaning those who are no longer engaging in current alcohol use. However, it is crucial to note that the ADA does not protect individuals who are currently using illegal drugs; it treats alcohol use differently, allowing for protections even if the individual is still consuming alcohol, provided they can perform the essential functions of their job.\n\nIn summary, alcoholism is considered a disability under the ADA when it leads to substantial limitations in major life activities, and individuals who are recovering from alcoholism are entitled to the same protections as those with other disabilities.
