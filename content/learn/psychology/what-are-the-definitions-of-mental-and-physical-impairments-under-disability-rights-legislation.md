    What are the definitions of mental and physical impairments under disability rights legislation?
answer: >-
    Under disability rights legislation, particularly the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the definitions of mental and physical impairments are as follows:\n\n1. **Physical Impairments**: These are defined as any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems. This includes, but is not limited to, conditions such as visual, speech, and hearing impairments; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; muscular dystrophy; and other chronic illnesses.\n\n2. **Mental Impairments**: These refer to any mental or psychological disorder that significantly limits an individual's ability to perform major life activities. This includes conditions such as emotional illnesses, specific learning disabilities, and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.\n\nBoth the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act emphasize that a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Major life activities can include tasks such as walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) further broadened the definition of disability to ensure that more individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination.\n\nIn summary, the definitions of mental and physical impairments under disability rights legislation are designed to encompass a wide range of conditions that significantly limit major life activities, ensuring that individuals with such impairments receive the necessary protections and accommodations.
