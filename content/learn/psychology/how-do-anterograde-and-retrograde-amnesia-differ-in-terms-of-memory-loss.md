    How do anterograde and retrograde amnesia differ in terms of memory loss?
answer: >-
    Anterograde and retrograde amnesia are two distinct types of memory loss that differ primarily in the timing and nature of the memories affected.\n\n1. **Anterograde Amnesia**:\n   - **Definition**: Anterograde amnesia is characterized by the inability to form new memories after the onset of the condition. This means that individuals with this type of amnesia can recall events and information that occurred before the onset but struggle to remember anything that happens afterward.\n   - **Example**: A classic case is that of patient H.M., who, after undergoing surgery for epilepsy, was unable to form new explicit memories. He could not remember meeting new people or learning new information, even if he had just interacted with them.\n\n2. **Retrograde Amnesia**:\n   - **Definition**: Retrograde amnesia involves the loss of memories that were formed prior to the onset of amnesia. Individuals may have difficulty recalling past events, experiences, or information that they had previously learned.\n   - **Example**: A person who has experienced a traumatic brain injury may not remember events that occurred in the months or years leading up to the injury, while still being able to form new memories after the injury.\n\nIn summary, the key difference lies in the direction of memory loss: anterograde amnesia affects the ability to create new memories, while retrograde amnesia affects the recall of previously stored memories. Both types of amnesia can occur due to various causes, including neurological disorders, traumatic brain injury, or psychological trauma.
