    What are the diagnostic criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?
answer: >-
    The diagnostic criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The criteria have been revised to enhance the reliability of diagnosis and to better reflect the symptoms experienced by individuals across different age groups, including adults.\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, the following criteria must be met for a diagnosis of ADHD:\n\n1. **Persistent Pattern of Inattention and/or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity**: The symptoms must be present for at least six months and must be inconsistent with the developmental level of the individual. The symptoms can be categorized into two main domains:\n   - **Inattention**: This includes symptoms such as difficulty sustaining attention, not following through on tasks, and being easily distracted.\n   - **Hyperactivity and Impulsivity**: This includes symptoms such as fidgeting, difficulty remaining seated, and interrupting others.\n\n2. **Number of Symptoms**: For children (ages 17 and younger), at least six symptoms from either the inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity categories must be present. For individuals aged 18 and older, at least five symptoms are required.\n\n3. **Age of Onset**: Several symptoms must have been present before the age of 12, which is a change from the previous DSM-IV-TR criteria that required symptoms to be present before age 7.\n\n4. **Functional Impairment**: The symptoms must cause significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Other Disorders**: The symptoms must not be better explained by another mental disorder, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders.\n\nThese criteria are designed to ensure that individuals are accurately diagnosed and can receive appropriate treatment for ADHD. The DSM-5 emphasizes the importance of considering the context in which symptoms occur and the impact they have on the individual's daily life.
