    What is the general definition of a personality disorder?
answer: >-
    A personality disorder is defined as a mental health condition characterized by enduring, inflexible patterns of thinking, behavior, and inner experience that deviate significantly from cultural expectations. These patterns typically emerge during adolescence or early adulthood and can lead to significant distress or functional impairment in various aspects of life, including interpersonal relationships and daily functioning.\n\nIndividuals with personality disorders often struggle to understand their emotions and may react to others in ways that create problems in their relationships. They may exhibit maladaptive behaviors and thought processes that are persistent and pervasive, affecting their quality of life. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), classifies personality disorders into three clusters based on similar characteristics and symptoms, which include a range of specific disorders that further define these maladaptive patterns. \n\nOverall, personality disorders represent a complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral issues that can significantly impact an individual's ability to navigate social situations and maintain a stable sense of self.
