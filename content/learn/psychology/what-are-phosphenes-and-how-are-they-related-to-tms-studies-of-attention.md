    What are phosphenes, and how are they related to TMS studies of attention?
answer: >-
    Phosphenes are visual sensations that manifest as flashes of light or patterns, typically occurring when pressure is applied to the eyes or when specific areas of the visual cortex are stimulated. One common method of inducing phosphenes is through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain.\n\nIn the context of TMS studies of attention, phosphenes serve as a valuable tool for investigating how attention influences visual perception. Research has shown that phosphenes are more readily detected when attention is directed toward the location where they are induced. This phenomenon supports the concept of space-based attention, which posits that our attentional resources can be allocated to specific spatial locations, enhancing our ability to perceive stimuli in those areas.\n\nFor example, in TMS studies, participants may experience phosphenes in different locations of their visual field. When their attention is cued to a specific location, they are more likely to report seeing phosphenes at that location compared to when their attention is not directed there. This finding aligns with the principles of the Posner Cueing Paradigm, where reaction times are faster for targets appearing at cued locations, demonstrating the efficiency of attentional allocation.\n\nOverall, the relationship between phosphenes and TMS studies provides insights into the mechanisms of attention, particularly how spatial attention can enhance visual processing and perception.
