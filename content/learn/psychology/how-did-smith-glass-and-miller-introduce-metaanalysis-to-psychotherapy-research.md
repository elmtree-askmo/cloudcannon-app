    How did Smith, Glass, and Miller introduce meta-analysis to psychotherapy research?
answer: >-
    Smith, Glass, and Miller introduced meta-analysis to psychotherapy research through their landmark work published in 1980, which synthesized findings from over 500 studies comparing various forms of psychological therapy with control conditions. Their meta-analysis was significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Aggregation of Findings**: They developed a systematic approach to aggregate results across multiple studies, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of psychotherapy outcomes. This was a pioneering effort in the field, as it enabled researchers to compare findings across different treatment approaches and client characteristics.\n\n2. **Effect Size Calculation**: Central to their analysis was the concept of effect size, which quantifies the magnitude of treatment effects. This allowed them to assess not just whether therapies were effective, but also how effective they were relative to one another.\n\n3. **Conclusion on Therapy Effectiveness**: Their findings indicated that psychotherapy is beneficial, with more individuals showing improvement after therapy compared to those who would have improved without treatment. They also noted that despite the theoretical differences among various psychotherapy schools, the empirical evidence showed negligible differences in effectiveness among different types of therapy.\n\n4. **Influence on Future Research**: The methodology and findings of Smith, Glass, and Miller's meta-analysis have had a lasting impact on psychotherapy research, establishing a framework for future studies to evaluate and compare therapeutic interventions systematically.\n\nTheir work is often cited as a foundational contribution to the field of psychotherapy research, demonstrating the utility of meta-analysis in synthesizing diverse research findings and informing clinical practice.
