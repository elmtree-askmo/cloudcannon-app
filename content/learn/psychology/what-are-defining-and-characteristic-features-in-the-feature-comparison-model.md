    What are defining and characteristic features in the Feature Comparison Model?
answer: >-
    The Feature Comparison Model is a cognitive theory that explains how individuals categorize concepts by comparing their features or attributes. It posits that concepts are represented by a list of semantic features, which can be divided into two main categories: defining features and characteristic features.\n\n1. **Defining Features**: These are the necessary and sufficient attributes that must be present for a concept to be classified as a member of a particular category. For example, for the category "bird," defining features might include having feathers and the ability to lay eggs. If a new object or concept possesses all the defining features of a category, it can be classified as a member of that category.\n\n2. **Characteristic Features**: These features are typical of a concept but are not essential for categorization. They help to describe the concept but do not determine membership. For instance, while a robin is a bird (defining features), being able to sing or having a red breast are characteristic features that are common but not necessary for something to be classified as a bird.\n\nThe processing of relationships between concepts in the Feature Comparison Model occurs through a comparison of these features. When individuals encounter a new object, they evaluate it against existing categories based on shared characteristics. This model also suggests that the more defining features a concept shares with a category, the quicker the categorization process will be.\n\nIn summary, the defining features are critical for determining category membership, while characteristic features provide additional context and typicality for the concept. This distinction is crucial for understanding how semantic memory is organized and how categorization decisions are made.
