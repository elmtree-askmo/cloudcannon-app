    Which major brain region is primarily responsible for higher cognitive functions such as decision making and problem-solving?
answer: >-
    The major brain region primarily responsible for higher cognitive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving is the **frontal lobe**. This region is part of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain and is crucial for various higher-level functions, including perception, cognition, and voluntary motor control.\n\nThe frontal lobe is specifically involved in complex cognitive processes, including planning, reasoning, and judgment. It integrates information from other brain regions to facilitate decision-making and problem-solving tasks. fMRI technology is often used to observe the activation of the frontal lobe during these cognitive tasks, providing insights into how neural activity correlates with specific cognitive processes.\n\nIn summary, the frontal lobe plays a critical role in higher cognitive functions, making it the primary region associated with decision-making and problem-solving.
