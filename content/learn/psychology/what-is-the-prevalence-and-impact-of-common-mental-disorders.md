    What is the prevalence and impact of common mental disorders?
answer: >-
    The prevalence of common mental disorders is significant and has been extensively studied across various populations. In the United States, for instance, approximately 22.8% of adults experienced mental illness in 2021, which translates to about 57.8 million people. Among these, 5.5% were reported to have serious mental illness, affecting around 14.1 million individuals. Additionally, mental health disorders are notably prevalent among youth, with 16.5% of U.S. youth aged 6-17 experiencing a mental health disorder in 2016, equating to about 7.7 million young people.\n\nGlobally, anxiety disorders are recognized as the most common mental health disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 3.8% in the general population. Depression also holds a high prevalence, affecting around 4.4% of the global population. The impact of these disorders is profound, influencing not only the individuals affected but also society at large. Mental disorders rank among the top ten leading causes of health loss worldwide, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common across all age groups and locations.\n\nThe societal implications of mental health disorders are multifaceted. They can lead to financial stress, strain relationships, and contribute to feelings of isolation and disconnection from communities. Despite the availability of effective treatments, a significant treatment gap persists, with estimates suggesting that only about half of individuals with mental illnesses receive the necessary care.\n\nIn summary, the prevalence of common mental disorders is high, with substantial impacts on individuals and society. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to improve access to mental health services and reduce stigma associated with mental illness.
