    How effective are group and family therapies in treating internet addiction?
answer: >-
    Group and family therapies have shown significant effectiveness in treating internet addiction, particularly among adolescents. Research indicates that multi-family group therapy can effectively reduce internet addiction behaviors. For instance, a six-session program demonstrated positive outcomes, suggesting that such interventions could be integrated into routine primary care services for similar populations. The involvement of family members is crucial, as it fosters positive interactions between parents and adolescents, which can help maintain the benefits of the intervention.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in a group format has also been effective in addressing internet addiction symptoms, improving quality of life, and enhancing mental health among students. Studies have reported that participants in group CBT not only experienced a reduction in internet addiction prevalence but also showed improvements in self-efficacy and self-control.\n\nFamily-based therapy has been particularly beneficial, with evidence showing that the severity of internet addiction in families receiving this type of therapy was significantly lower compared to control groups. The effectiveness of family involvement is further supported by findings that highlight the importance of addressing family-of-origin issues and communication patterns, which can enhance treatment outcomes.\n\nOverall, the integration of family and group therapies in the treatment of internet addiction appears to be a promising approach, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts between therapists, families, and other institutions to effectively address this growing concern. Future research could further explore the long-term effects of these therapies and identify specific factors that enhance treatment outcomes when family members are actively involved.
