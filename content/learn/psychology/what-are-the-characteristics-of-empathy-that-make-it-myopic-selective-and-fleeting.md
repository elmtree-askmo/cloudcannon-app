    What are the characteristics of empathy that make it myopic, selective, and fleeting?
answer: >-
    Empathy is a complex emotional response that can be characterized as myopic, selective, and fleeting due to several underlying factors:\n\n1. **Myopic**: Empathy can be myopic because it often focuses on immediate emotional experiences rather than considering broader contexts or long-term consequences. This narrow focus can lead individuals to respond to the most visible or emotionally charged situations while neglecting others that may also require attention. For instance, in a case study mentioned in the lecture, a child with a rare immune disease may evoke strong empathetic responses due to their visible suffering, overshadowing the needs of other patients who may be equally deserving of empathy but less visible.\n\n2. **Selective**: Empathy is selective in that it tends to be directed towards individuals or groups with whom one can identify or relate. Factors such as social proximity, shared experiences, or perceived similarity can influence whom we feel empathy for. This selectivity can lead to biases in empathetic responses, where individuals may show more compassion towards those who are similar to them or who fit certain narratives, while disregarding others who may be suffering equally or more.\n\n3. **Fleeting**: The fleeting nature of empathy refers to its temporary and often situational quality. Empathetic feelings can arise quickly in response to specific stimuli but may dissipate just as rapidly. This transience can be influenced by emotional regulation mechanisms, personal distress, or the overwhelming nature of the emotions involved. For example, when faced with distressing situations, individuals may initially feel empathy but then withdraw as a coping mechanism, leading to a decrease in empathetic engagement over time.\n\nThese characteristics of empathy can also be influenced by neuroendocrinological factors, particularly the role of hormones like testosterone, which can affect emotional reactivity and aggression. The interplay between empathy and aggression suggests that the same neural pathways may be involved, complicating the emotional responses individuals exhibit in various situations.\n\nIn summary, empathy's myopic, selective, and fleeting characteristics highlight the complexities of human emotional responses and the factors that can shape them, including biological influences and social contexts.
