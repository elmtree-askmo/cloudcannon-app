    What are the main symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?
answer: >-
    Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both. The main symptoms of OCD can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **Obsessions**: These are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that repeatedly enter a person's mind. They often provoke significant anxiety or distress. Common themes of obsessions include fears of contamination, fears of harming oneself or others, fears of making a mistake, or the need for symmetry and order.\n\n2. **Compulsions**: These are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules. The purpose of these compulsions is often to reduce the anxiety associated with the obsessions or to prevent a feared event from occurring. Examples of compulsions include excessive hand washing, checking locks or appliances repeatedly, counting, or arranging items in a specific order.\n\n3. **Impact on Daily Life**: The symptoms of OCD can be time-consuming and may interfere significantly with daily activities, relationships, and overall quality of life. Individuals may spend hours each day engaging in compulsive behaviors or ruminating over obsessive thoughts.\n\nIt's important to note that OCD symptoms can vary in intensity and may come and go over time. If symptoms interfere with daily functioning, it is advisable to seek help from a healthcare professional. Treatment options often include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), and/or medication such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
