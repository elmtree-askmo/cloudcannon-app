    What causes scotoma and how does it differ from hemianopia?
answer: >-
    Scotoma and hemianopia are both types of visual field loss, but they differ significantly in their characteristics and underlying causes.\n\n### Scotoma\nA scotoma is defined as a partial loss of vision or a blind spot in an otherwise normal visual field. It can manifest as a small area of diminished or absent vision, which may be temporary or permanent. The causes of scotoma can vary widely and include:\n\n- **Migraines:** A scintillating scotoma is often associated with migraine aura, where individuals may experience visual disturbances such as flashing lights or zigzag patterns before the onset of a headache.\n- **Retinal Diseases:** Conditions affecting the retina, such as macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, can lead to scotomas.\n- **Damage to Visual Pathways:** Any injury or disease affecting the pathways that transmit visual information from the eyes to the brain can result in scotomas.\n\n### Hemianopia\nHemianopia, on the other hand, refers to a loss of vision in half of the visual field in one or both eyes. This condition is typically caused by damage to the occipital lobe or the optic pathways. For example:\n\n- **Left Homonymous Hemianopia:** If the right occipital lobe is damaged, the individual may lose vision in the left visual field of both eyes.\n- **Bitemporal Hemianopia:** Damage to the optic chiasm can lead to loss of vision in the outer (temporal) halves of the visual fields of both eyes.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Extent of Vision Loss:** Scotoma affects a specific, localized area of the visual field, while hemianopia affects a larger, defined half of the visual field.\n- **Causes:** Scotomas can arise from a variety of conditions, including migraines and retinal issues, whereas hemianopia is primarily associated with neurological damage, particularly in the occipital lobe or optic pathways.\n\nIn summary, while both conditions involve visual field loss, scotoma is characterized by localized blind spots, and hemianopia involves a more extensive loss affecting half of the visual field.
