    How does self-esteem typically change during adolescence?
answer: >-
    Self-esteem during adolescence is a complex and dynamic aspect of development that can fluctuate significantly due to various factors. Research indicates that self-esteem, often referred to as self-worth or self-image, is a global evaluative dimension of the self and is crucial during this developmental stage (Harter, 2006). \n\nTypically, self-esteem tends to decline during early adolescence, particularly around the transition to middle school, as adolescents face new social dynamics and academic pressures. This decline can be attributed to increased self-consciousness and the challenges of navigating peer relationships and identity formation. As adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly and consider multiple perspectives, they may become more critical of themselves, leading to fluctuations in self-esteem (Kling et al., 1999).\n\nInterestingly, there is often a second drop in self-esteem that occurs towards the end of adolescence, particularly during the ages of 18 to 23, when individuals confront the realities of independence and the responsibilities that come with it. This period can be daunting, as young adults grapple with their identity and future prospects (Roffman et al.).\n\nMoreover, low self-esteem during adolescence is associated with various negative outcomes, including poorer mental and physical health, economic challenges, and higher levels of criminal activity in young adulthood (Trzesniewski et al., 2006). Factors influencing self-esteem development include parental support, peer relationships, and individual experiences, such as academic performance and life events (Harter, 2012).\n\nIn summary, self-esteem in adolescence is characterized by initial declines followed by potential recovery or further fluctuations, influenced by a myriad of contextual and individual factors. Understanding these changes is essential for developing interventions aimed at promoting healthy self-esteem and mitigating associated risks during this critical developmental period.
