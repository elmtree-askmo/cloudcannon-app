    What are the gender differences in prenatal and perinatal vulnerability?
answer: >-
    Gender differences in prenatal and perinatal vulnerability are significant, with research indicating that boys are generally more vulnerable than girls to various hazards and diseases during these critical developmental periods. \n\n1. **Prenatal Vulnerability**: Boys are more susceptible to prenatal hazards, which can include exposure to teratogens (substances that can cause malformation) and maternal health issues. This increased vulnerability can lead to a higher incidence of complications during pregnancy that may affect fetal development.\n\n2. **Perinatal Vulnerability**: During the perinatal period, which encompasses the time immediately before and after birth, boys continue to show greater vulnerability. They are more likely to experience complications such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and perinatal asphyxia. \n\n3. **Developmental Issues**: Following birth, boys are at a higher risk for developmental issues, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disabilities, and speech defects. This trend suggests that the vulnerabilities observed during prenatal and perinatal stages may contribute to a higher prevalence of these conditions in boys compared to girls.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Influences**: While biological factors play a role in these vulnerabilities, social and cultural factors also contribute. Gender role stereotypes and parental expectations can influence how boys and girls are treated even before birth, potentially affecting their developmental trajectories.\n\nIn summary, boys exhibit greater prenatal and perinatal vulnerability compared to girls, leading to a higher likelihood of developmental challenges. This difference is influenced by both biological predispositions and social factors that shape early experiences.
