answer: >-
    The James-Lange Theory of emotion is a significant psychological theory that explains the sequence of responses involved in the experience of emotions. According to this theory, the process unfolds in the following manner:\n\n1. **Stimulus Encounter**: An individual encounters a stimulus that provokes a reaction. This could be anything from a threatening animal to a beautiful sunset.\n\n2. **Physiological Arousal**: The body responds to the stimulus with physiological changes. This includes alterations in heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, and other autonomic nervous system responses. For example, if you see a snake, your heart might race, and you may start to sweat.\n\n3. **Emotional Experience**: Following the physiological changes, the individual interprets these bodily responses as a specific emotion. In the snake example, the increased heart rate and sweating may lead the person to feel fear. Thus, the theory posits that we feel sad because we cry, or we feel fear because we tremble.\n\nIn summary, the sequence in the James-Lange Theory can be encapsulated as follows: stimulus → physiological arousal → emotional experience. This theory emphasizes that our emotions are a direct result of our physiological reactions to external events, contrasting with other theories that suggest emotions and physiological responses occur simultaneously or that cognitive appraisal plays a significant role in emotional experience.
