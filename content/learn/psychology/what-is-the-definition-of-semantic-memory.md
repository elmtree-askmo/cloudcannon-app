    What is the definition of semantic memory?
answer: >-
    Semantic memory is a type of long-term memory that encompasses general world knowledge that individuals have accumulated throughout their lives. This includes information such as word meanings, concepts, facts, and ideas, which are not tied to personal experiences. Semantic memory allows individuals to understand language, share ideas, and interpret their experiences, forming a mental storehouse of knowledge about the world.\n\nIt is distinct from episodic memory, which involves the recollection of specific events and experiences. While episodic memory can contribute to the formation of semantic memory—where new facts or concepts are learned from personal experiences—semantic memory itself is characterized by its independence from those experiences. \n\nIn summary, semantic memory is crucial for cognitive functions, enabling individuals to process and utilize knowledge about the world, and it plays a significant role in social cognition and cultural understanding.
