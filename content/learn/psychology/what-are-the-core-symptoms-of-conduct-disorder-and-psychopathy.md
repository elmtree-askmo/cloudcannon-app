    What are the core symptoms of conduct disorder and psychopathy?
answer: >-
    The core symptoms of conduct disorder and psychopathy are distinct yet share some overlapping features related to antisocial behavior. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of each:\n\n### Conduct Disorder\nConduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder primarily diagnosed in children and adolescents, characterized by a pattern of disruptive and violent behavior. The core symptoms of conduct disorder include:\n\n1. **Aggression Towards People and Animals**: This can manifest as physical fights, bullying, or threatening behavior towards peers, family members, or animals.\n\n2. **Destruction of Property**: This includes vandalism or deliberate destruction of others' belongings, often intended to intimidate or assert control.\n\n3. **Deceitfulness**: Involves lying, stealing, or manipulating others for personal gain or to avoid consequences.\n\n4. **Rule Violations**: Engaging in behaviors that violate societal norms or rules, such as truancy or running away from home.\n\n5. **Theft**: This can include shoplifting or breaking and entering.\n\nThe prevalence of conduct disorder is estimated to occur in 5-7% of the population, with higher rates of referral for treatment among males compared to females.\n\n### Psychopathy\nPsychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy, and remorse. The core symptoms of psychopathy include:\n\n1. **Lack of Empathy**: Individuals with psychopathy often show an inability to understand or share the feelings of others.\n\n2. **Lack of Guilt or Remorse**: They typically do not feel guilt for their harmful actions, which can lead to repeated antisocial behavior.\n\n3. **Insensitive to Punishment**: Psychopaths often do not learn from punishment or negative consequences, which can perpetuate their behavior.\n\n4. **Self-Centered and Reward-Focused**: They tend to prioritize their own needs and desires over the well-being of others, often engaging in manipulative or exploitative behaviors.\n\n5. **Charming and Manipulative**: Many psychopaths can be superficially charming and use this to manipulate others for personal gain.\n\nThe prevalence of psychopathy is found in about 1% of the general population and approximately 30% of the incarcerated population. Notably, there are "successful psychopaths" who may not engage in criminal behavior but still exhibit psychopathic traits.\n\n### Summary\nWhile both conduct disorder and psychopathy involve antisocial behaviors, conduct disorder is more focused on specific behaviors typically seen in youth, whereas psychopathy encompasses a broader personality profile that persists into adulthood. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.
