    How does post-conventional morality differ from conventional morality?
answer: >-
    Post-conventional morality differs from conventional morality in several key ways, primarily in the basis of moral reasoning and the understanding of laws and ethical principles.\n\n1. **Basis of Moral Reasoning**:\n   - **Conventional Morality**: This level of moral development is characterized by adherence to social norms and rules. Individuals at this stage make moral judgments based on the approval of others and the maintenance of social order. For example, actions are deemed right if they align with societal expectations or laws, reflecting a "Good Boy/Good Girl" orientation and a "Law and Order" perspective.\n   - **Post-Conventional Morality**: In contrast, post-conventional morality is marked by a recognition of universal ethical principles and individual rights. Individuals at this stage evaluate actions based on self-chosen principles that transcend specific laws or societal norms. This includes the understanding that laws can be changed if they infringe on basic human rights, as seen in Stage 5 (Morality of Contract, Individual Rights, and Democratically Accepted Laws) and Stage 6 (Morality of Individual Principles of Conscience).\n\n2. **Flexibility of Laws**:\n   - **Conventional Morality**: Laws are viewed as absolute and must be followed to maintain social order. The focus is on conformity and the consequences of breaking laws.\n   - **Post-Conventional Morality**: Laws are seen as social contracts that can be modified or challenged if they conflict with ethical principles or individual rights. This reflects a more critical and reflective approach to morality, where individuals may advocate for civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws.\n\n3. **Developmental Progression**:\n   - Individuals typically transition from conventional to post-conventional morality during late adolescence or adulthood, influenced by factors such as motivation, social perspective-taking, and exposure to equitable social institutions. This progression indicates a deeper understanding of justice and moral reasoning.\n\nIn summary, while conventional morality is rooted in social conformity and the maintenance of order, post-conventional morality emphasizes individual rights, ethical principles, and the potential for laws to evolve based on justice and fairness.
