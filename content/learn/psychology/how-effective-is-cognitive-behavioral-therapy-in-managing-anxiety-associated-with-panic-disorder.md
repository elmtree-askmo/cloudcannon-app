    How effective is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in managing anxiety associated with panic disorder?
answer: >-
    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as an effective first-line treatment for panic disorder. Numerous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in managing anxiety associated with this condition. Research indicates that CBT not only provides a relatively quick onset of action but also maintains treatment benefits over the long term. Typically, CBT for panic disorder consists of 12-15 sessions, which can be delivered in individual or group formats.\n\nThe effectiveness of CBT is supported by controlled clinical trials, which show that it is well-accepted and tolerated by patients. For instance, CBT has been shown to help individuals recognize the connections between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, enabling them to manage their anxiety more effectively. This approach is particularly beneficial for those who have not responded adequately to pharmacological treatments.\n\nQuantitative literature reviews and meta-analyses have further corroborated the effectiveness of CBT. For example, a Cochrane meta-analysis found that psychological therapies, primarily using a CBT approach, were more effective than treatment as usual or waitlist controls in achieving clinical responses in patients with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder.\n\nWhile the controlled effect size for CBT in panic disorder is not as high as for some other anxiety disorders, it still demonstrates a medium effect size, indicating that CBT is a valuable intervention. Additionally, follow-up studies suggest that the benefits of CBT can persist over time, although the effect size for panic disorder specifically may vary.\n\nIn summary, CBT is a robust and effective treatment for managing anxiety associated with panic disorder, offering both immediate and long-term benefits for patients.
