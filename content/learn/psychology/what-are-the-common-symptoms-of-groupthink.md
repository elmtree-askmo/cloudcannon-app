    What are the common symptoms of groupthink?
answer: >-
    Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a group prioritizes consensus and harmony over critical thinking and individual dissent, often leading to poor decision-making. Irving Janis, who coined the term in 1972, identified eight symptoms that indicate the presence of groupthink within a team. These symptoms are:\n\n1. **Illusions of Invulnerability**: Group members may develop an overconfidence in their decisions, believing that they are immune to failure or negative consequences.\n\n2. **Collective Rationalization**: Members may dismiss warnings or negative feedback, rationalizing their decisions and ignoring any contrary evidence.\n\n3. **Belief in Inherent Group Morality**: The group may believe that their decisions are morally superior, leading to unethical outcomes.\n\n4. **Stereotyping Outsiders**: Those who oppose the group's decisions may be stereotyped as outsiders or enemies, which discourages dissent.\n\n5. **Self-Censorship**: Individuals may withhold their opinions or concerns to avoid disrupting the group's harmony, leading to a lack of diverse viewpoints.\n\n6. **Illusions of Unanimity**: Silence is perceived as agreement, creating a false sense of consensus among group members.\n\n7. **Direct Pressure on Dissenters**: Members who voice opposing views may face pressure to conform, discouraging open discussion.\n\n8. **Mindguards**: Some members may act as gatekeepers, shielding the group from dissenting information or viewpoints that could challenge the group's decisions.\n\nRecognizing these symptoms is crucial for preventing groupthink and fostering a more open and effective decision-making environment. By encouraging diverse perspectives and critical discussions, groups can mitigate the risks associated with groupthink and improve their overall decision-making processes.
