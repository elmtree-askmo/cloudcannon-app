    What are the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Social Communication Disorder?
answer: >-
    The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Social Communication Disorder (SCD), also known as Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, are outlined as follows:\n\n### Diagnostic Criteria for Social Communication Disorder (315.39, F80.89)\n\n**Criterion A:** \nPersistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication as manifested by all of the following:\n\n1. **Deficits in using communication for social purposes**: This includes challenges in greeting others, sharing information appropriately, and engaging in conversation in a manner that is suitable for the social context.\n   \n2. **Impairment in the ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the listener**: Individuals may struggle to adjust their language based on the audience or situation, leading to misunderstandings or inappropriate responses.\n\n3. **Difficulty following the rules for conversation and storytelling**: This includes challenges in taking turns during conversations, staying on topic, and understanding the structure of narratives.\n\n4. **Deficits in nonverbal communication**: Individuals may have trouble understanding or using nonverbal cues such as facial expressions, body language, and gestures, which are essential for effective social interaction.\n\n**Criterion B:** \nThe difficulties in social communication must be **persistent** and must have been present in the early developmental period (typically recognized in the early years of life).\n\n**Criterion C:** \nThe social communication deficits must **significantly impair** the individual's ability to participate in social, academic, or occupational activities.\n\n**Criterion D:** \nThe symptoms must not be better explained by another medical condition (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or another neurodevelopmental disorder) and must not be attributable to a lack of proficiency in the language expected in the individual's environment.\n\nThese criteria highlight the specific challenges faced by individuals with SCD, particularly in the context of social interactions and communication, distinguishing it from other disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which includes additional features like restricted and repetitive behaviors.
