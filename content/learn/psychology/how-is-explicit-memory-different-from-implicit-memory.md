    How is explicit memory different from implicit memory?
answer: >-
    Explicit memory and implicit memory are two distinct types of long-term memory that serve different functions and involve different processes.\n\n1. **Explicit Memory**: This type of memory is conscious and declarative, meaning it requires active recall and effort to retrieve information. Explicit memory allows individuals to bring information into conscious awareness, such as facts, events, and experiences. It is often categorized into two subtypes:\n   - **Episodic Memory**: This involves personal experiences and specific events, including the context in which they occurred.\n   - **Semantic Memory**: This involves general knowledge and facts about the world, independent of personal experience.\n\n   Explicit memory tends to fade in the absence of recall and requires several rounds of stimulation and significant effort to form. It plays a crucial role in academic learning and tasks that require direct attention and recall.\n\n2. **Implicit Memory**: In contrast, implicit memory is unconscious and automatic. It allows individuals to perform tasks without needing to consciously recall how to do them. This type of memory is often associated with skills and habits, such as riding a bike or playing a musical instrument. Implicit memory is more robust and can last a lifetime, even without further practice. It is sometimes referred to as nondeclarative memory and includes procedural memory, which helps individuals remember how to perform actions.\n\nA simple way to differentiate the two is to think of implicit memory as "knowing how" (e.g., skills and procedures) and explicit memory as "knowing that" (e.g., facts and information). Both types of memory are essential for shaping an individual's ability to learn and interact with the world, but they operate through different mechanisms and brain regions.
