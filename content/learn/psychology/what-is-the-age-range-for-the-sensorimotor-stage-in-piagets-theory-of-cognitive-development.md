    What is the age range for the sensorimotor stage in Piaget's theory of cognitive development?
answer: >-
    In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the sensorimotor stage occurs from birth to approximately two years of age. This stage is characterized by infants learning about the world primarily through their sensory experiences and motor actions. It is further divided into six substages, which illustrate the progression from reflexive reactions to more intentional and complex behaviors, including the development of object permanence.
