    What are the characteristics and symptoms of pyromania?
answer: >-
    Pyromania is classified as an impulse control disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It is characterized by an obsessive desire or irresistible impulse to set fires, which individuals engage in for personal reasons rather than for monetary gain or as part of another mental health condition.\n\n### Characteristics and Symptoms of Pyromania:\n\n1. **Deliberate Fire Setting**: Individuals with pyromania intentionally set fires on more than one occasion. This behavior is not motivated by external rewards, such as financial gain, but rather by an internal compulsion.\n\n2. **Tension Relief**: People with pyromania often report that setting fires relieves feelings of tension or anxiety. This compulsion can be seen as a way to cope with emotional distress.\n\n3. **Fire-Setting Behaviors**: The fire-setting behaviors may fluctuate, often appearing during adolescence or early adulthood. These behaviors can come and go, and individuals may experience periods of increased or decreased impulse to set fires.\n\n4. **Associated Psychological Conditions**: Pyromania is frequently associated with other psychiatric disorders, such as mood disorders, substance use disorders, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is important to note that a diagnosis of pyromania is not made if fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder, or in response to delusions or hallucinations.\n\n5. **Diagnostic Criteria**: According to the DSM-5, the essential features of pyromania include:\n   - Criterion A: Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.\n   - Criterion B: The individual experiences tension or affective arousal before the act of fire setting.\n   - Criterion C: The individual feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or witnessing the aftermath.\n\n### Treatment Options:\nThe standard treatment for pyromania typically involves cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps individuals recognize the feelings of tension that lead to fire setting and develop healthier coping mechanisms. While there are no specific medications approved for treating pyromania, healthcare providers may prescribe medications to address co-occurring conditions such as anxiety or depression.\n\nIn summary, pyromania is a complex disorder that requires careful diagnosis and treatment, often in conjunction with other mental health issues. Understanding its characteristics and symptoms is crucial for effective intervention and support.
