    What are the types of delusions commonly seen in delusional disorders?
answer: >-
    Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of one or more delusions that persist for a month or longer. The types of delusions commonly seen in delusional disorders can be classified into several categories according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Here are the primary types:\n\n1. **Persecutory Type**: The individual believes that they are being targeted or harassed by others, such as being followed, conspired against, or spied on.\n\n2. **Erotomanic Type**: This involves the belief that another person, often of higher status or a stranger, is in love with the individual. People with this delusion may attempt to contact the object of their delusion through various means.\n\n3. **Grandiose Type**: The individual has an inflated sense of self-importance or believes they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame.\n\n4. **Jealous Type**: This delusion centers around the belief that a partner is being unfaithful, often leading to accusations and confrontations.\n\n5. **Somatic Type**: Individuals believe they have a physical defect or medical condition, despite a lack of medical evidence to support these beliefs.\n\n6. **Mixed Type**: This category is used when the delusions do not fit neatly into one of the above types.\n\n7. **Unspecified Type**: This is used when the delusions are present but do not conform to the criteria of the other types.\n\nThese delusions can significantly impact the individual's life, but unlike schizophrenia, delusional disorder does not typically involve other psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or disorganized behavior. Understanding these types is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning.
