answer: >-
    In the Atkinson-Shiffrin Model, sensory memory serves as the initial stage of memory processing. Proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968, this model categorizes memory into three distinct stores: sensory memory, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM).\n\nSensory memory is characterized by its brief duration and limited capacity. It allows individuals to take in vast amounts of information through their senses, but this information is only retained for a very short periodâ€”typically up to 4 seconds. The encoding in sensory memory occurs separately for each sensory modality, meaning that visual information is stored in a visual sensory register, while auditory information is stored in an auditory sensory register, and so forth.\n\nThe primary role of sensory memory is to act as a buffer for stimuli received through the senses, providing a fleeting snapshot of the environment. This initial storage is crucial because it allows for the selection of relevant information that can be further processed in short-term memory. If the information captured in sensory memory is deemed important or relevant, it can be transferred to short-term memory, where it can be held for a longer duration and manipulated before potentially being encoded into long-term memory.\n\nOverall, sensory memory is essential for filtering and processing the overwhelming amount of sensory information we encounter, enabling us to focus on what is most pertinent for further cognitive processing.
