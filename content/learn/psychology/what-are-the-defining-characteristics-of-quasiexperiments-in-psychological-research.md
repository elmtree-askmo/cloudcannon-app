    What are the defining characteristics of quasi-experiments in psychological research?
answer: >-
    Quasi-experiments are a type of research design in psychology that share some characteristics with true experiments but lack the critical element of random assignment of participants to conditions. Here are the defining characteristics of quasi-experiments:\n\n1. **Manipulation of Independent Variables**: Like true experiments, quasi-experiments involve the manipulation of one or more independent variables to observe their effect on dependent variables. This allows researchers to establish a cause-and-effect relationship, albeit with some limitations.\n\n2. **Lack of Random Assignment**: The most significant difference between quasi-experiments and true experiments is the absence of random assignment. Participants are assigned to groups based on specific criteria or existing characteristics rather than randomly. This can lead to potential confounding variables that may influence the results.\n\n3. **Comparison Groups**: Quasi-experimental designs often involve comparing outcomes between different groups, such as intervention and control groups. However, these groups may not be equivalent at baseline due to the lack of randomization.\n\n4. **Ethical and Practical Considerations**: Quasi-experiments are frequently employed in situations where true experiments would be unethical or impractical. For example, researchers may study the effects of educational programs or public health interventions where random assignment is not feasible.\n\n5. **Real-World Settings**: Quasi-experiments are often conducted in natural or field settings rather than controlled laboratory environments. This can enhance the ecological validity of the findings but may also introduce additional variables that are harder to control.\n\n6. **Types of Quasi-Experimental Designs**: There are various designs within quasi-experimental research, such as non-equivalent groups design, pre-test/post-test design, and interrupted time series design. Each of these designs has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of controlling for confounding variables.\n\nIn summary, quasi-experiments are valuable in psychological research for examining causal relationships when random assignment is not possible, but researchers must be cautious about the potential for confounding variables and the limitations this imposes on the conclusions that can be drawn from the findings.
