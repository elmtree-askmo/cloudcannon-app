    Differentiate between overt and covert behavior with examples.
answer: >-
    Overt and covert behaviors are two fundamental concepts in behavior analysis that differentiate between observable actions and internal processes.\n\n**Overt Behavior:**\nOvert behavior refers to actions that are observable and measurable by others. These behaviors can be directly assessed and modified through behavior modification techniques. For example:\n- A student raising their hand to answer a question in class is an overt behavior. This action is visible to others and can be easily measured in terms of frequency or context.\n\n**Covert Behavior:**\nCovert behavior, on the other hand, refers to internal processes that are not directly observable, such as thoughts, feelings, and mental states. These behaviors require self-reporting or indirect measures for assessment. For example:\n- A person feeling nervous before a presentation is an example of covert behavior. This internal state influences their performance but cannot be directly observed by others. Other examples include making plans, decision-making, or daydreaming.\n\nIn summary, overt behaviors are actions that can be seen and measured, while covert behaviors are private events occurring within an individual's mind that influence their overt actions but cannot be directly observed.
