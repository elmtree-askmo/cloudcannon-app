    What are the stages of development in Erikson’s psychosocial theory?
answer: >-
    Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development outlines eight distinct stages that individuals progress through from birth to old age. Each stage is characterized by a central psychosocial conflict that must be resolved for healthy psychological development. Here are the stages:\n\n1. **Trust vs. Mistrust** (Birth to 18 months): In this initial stage, infants learn to trust their caregivers and the world around them. Successful resolution leads to a sense of security, while failure results in fear and suspicion.\n\n2. **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt** (18 months to 3 years): During this stage, toddlers begin to assert their independence. If caregivers encourage self-sufficiency, children develop autonomy; if they are overly controlled, they may feel shame and doubt their abilities.\n\n3. **Initiative vs. Guilt** (3 to 6 years): In this stage, children initiate activities and assert control over their environment. Successful resolution fosters a sense of initiative, while failure can lead to feelings of guilt over their needs and desires.\n\n4. **Industry vs. Inferiority** (5 to 12 years): As children enter school, they develop skills and competencies. Success leads to a sense of industry and achievement, while failure can result in feelings of inferiority.\n\n5. **Identity vs. Role Confusion** (12 to 18 years): Adolescents explore their independence and develop a sense of self. Successful resolution leads to a strong identity, while failure can result in confusion about one's role in society.\n\n6. **Intimacy vs. Isolation** (Young adulthood): In this stage, individuals seek deep relationships and connections with others. Successful resolution leads to strong relationships, while failure can result in isolation and loneliness.\n\n7. **Generativity vs. Stagnation** (Middle adulthood): Adults strive to create or nurture things that will outlast them, often through parenting or work. Success leads to feelings of usefulness and accomplishment, while failure can result in shallow involvement in the world.\n\n8. **Integrity vs. Despair** (Late adulthood): In this final stage, individuals reflect on their lives. A sense of fulfillment leads to integrity, while regret and dissatisfaction can result in despair.\n\nErikson's theory emphasizes that personality development continues throughout the lifespan, with each stage building upon the successful resolution of previous conflicts. This framework has been influential in understanding human development and the challenges faced at different life stages.
