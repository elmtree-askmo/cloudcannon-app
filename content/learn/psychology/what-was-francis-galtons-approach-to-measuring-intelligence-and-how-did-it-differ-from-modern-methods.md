    What was Francis Galton's approach to measuring intelligence, and how did it differ from modern methods?
answer: >-
    Francis Galton's approach to measuring intelligence, known as the anthropometric approach, focused primarily on assessing physical and sensory abilities as indicators of intelligence. Galton believed that individuals with superior sensory capabilities—such as better vision, hearing, and reaction times—would be more adept at learning and, consequently, more intelligent. His methods included a variety of sensory tests aimed at quantifying these abilities.\n\nHowever, Galton's approach faced significant criticism. Research showed that the correlations between sensory test scores and academic success were weak or nonexistent. This led to the conclusion that intelligence is a more complex construct than what could be captured through mere sensory measurements. Modern definitions of intelligence emphasize cognitive processes such as reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and comprehension, which are not adequately assessed by Galton's methods.\n\nIn contrast, contemporary intelligence testing methods, such as the Stanford-Binet Test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), focus on a broader range of cognitive abilities. These tests assess various aspects of intelligence, including verbal and non-verbal reasoning, memory, and processing speed, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of an individual's intellectual capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, modern intelligence tests are designed to minimize cultural bias, recognizing that factors such as socioeconomic status, educational background, and cultural differences can significantly influence test performance. This is a notable shift from Galton's era, where the focus was primarily on physical attributes without consideration for environmental influences.\n\nIn summary, while Galton's anthropometric approach was pioneering in its attempt to quantify intelligence, it has been largely supplanted by more sophisticated and holistic methods that account for the multifaceted nature of intelligence and the various influences that shape it.
