    What is the age of viability and why is it significant?
answer: >-
    The age of viability is a significant milestone in human development, typically occurring around 24 weeks of gestation. It marks the point at which a fetus has a reasonable chance of surviving outside the womb, primarily due to the development of critical organs such as the lungs and brain. Advances in medical technology have also played a crucial role in extending the boundaries of viability, with some medical professionals considering 22 or 23 weeks as potential points of viability.\n\nDuring this period, the majority of neurons in the brain have developed, and the fetus's organs are maturing, which is essential for independent survival. The age of viability is particularly important in the context of prenatal care and decision-making regarding premature births. It influences medical practices, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations surrounding the care of premature infants.\n\nIn summary, the age of viability is significant because it represents a critical threshold for fetal survival, shaped by biological development and enhanced by medical advancements, impacting both clinical practices and societal discussions regarding prenatal health.
