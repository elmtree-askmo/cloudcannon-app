    How does Marian Franklin guide clients to new perspectives in her coaching philosophy?
answer: >-
    Marian Franklin's coaching philosophy is centered around guiding clients to new perspectives through a structured yet flexible approach. Her method, as outlined in her book *The HeART of Laser-Focused Coaching*, emphasizes the importance of deep listening and neutrality, allowing clients to uncover their own realizations rather than imposing solutions. This approach fosters transformative conversations that help clients move past entrenched thinking and frustrating situations.\n\nFranklin believes that by unpacking rigid thought patterns, clients can gain clarity and insight into their circumstances. She encourages coaches to set aside their own needs and focus entirely on the client, which creates a safe space for exploration and growth. This client-centered focus is crucial for helping individuals chart their own paths toward their goals.\n\nIn her coaching practice, Franklin employs a step-by-step framework that includes probing deeply into the truth of a client's situation. This method not only facilitates a shift in perspective but also empowers clients to find their own solutions. By guiding clients through this process, Franklin helps them recognize and overcome the mental barriers that may be holding them back.\n\nOverall, Marian Franklin's insights and techniques provide both new and experienced coaches with valuable tools to enhance their practice and support their clients in achieving meaningful change. Her emphasis on listening, questioning, and facilitating self-discovery is key to her philosophy of coaching.
