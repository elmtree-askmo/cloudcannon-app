    What are the key differences between implicit and explicit processes in cognitive neuroscience?
answer: >-
    In cognitive neuroscience, implicit and explicit processes represent two distinct types of cognitive functioning that differ primarily in their level of awareness and control.\n\n### Implicit Processes\n- **Definition**: Implicit processes are automatic and occur without conscious awareness. They are often fast and efficient, allowing the brain to handle a large volume of information without requiring focused attention.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - **Automaticity**: These processes operate without deliberate thought. For example, when driving a familiar route, a person may navigate effectively without consciously thinking about each turn.\n  - **Memory**: Implicit memory is involved, which includes skills and conditioned responses that are not consciously recalled. For instance, riding a bicycle or typing on a keyboard relies on implicit memory.\n  - **Speed**: Implicit processes are typically quicker than explicit processes, allowing for rapid responses to stimuli.\n\n### Explicit Processes\n- **Definition**: Explicit processes involve conscious thought and decision-making. They require focused attention and are often slower and more deliberate.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - **Conscious Awareness**: These processes are characterized by active engagement and awareness. For example, solving a complex math problem necessitates explicit thought and concentration.\n  - **Controlled Processing**: Explicit processes are more flexible and can be adjusted based on new information or changing circumstances. They allow for reasoning, planning, and problem-solving.\n  - **Memory**: Explicit memory is involved, which includes facts and events that can be consciously recalled, such as remembering a specific date or a historical event.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Awareness**: Implicit processes occur without conscious awareness, while explicit processes require conscious thought.\n- **Control**: Implicit processes are automatic and fast, whereas explicit processes are controlled and slower.\n- **Memory Type**: Implicit processes rely on implicit memory (skills and conditioned responses), while explicit processes depend on explicit memory (facts and events).\n\nThese distinctions are crucial in understanding how humans process information and make decisions, as outlined in the Dual Process Theory, which posits that human thought arises from these two distinct systems.
