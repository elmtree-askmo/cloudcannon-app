    What are declarative memories and how are they categorized?
answer: >-
    Declarative memory, also known as explicit memory, is a type of long-term memory that involves the conscious recollection of facts, events, and experiences. It is characterized by the ability to articulate knowledge and past experiences, making it distinct from non-declarative (or implicit) memory, which encompasses unconscious memories such as skills and habits.\n\nDeclarative memory is broadly categorized into two main types:\n\n1. **Episodic Memory**: This type of memory pertains to personal experiences and specific events that an individual has encountered at particular times and places. For example, recalling a birthday party or a vacation trip falls under episodic memory. It allows individuals to remember the context of events, including the who, what, where, and when.\n\n2. **Semantic Memory**: In contrast, semantic memory involves general knowledge and facts about the world that are not tied to personal experiences. This includes information such as knowing that Paris is the capital of France or understanding the concept of gravity. Semantic memory functions like a mental dictionary, providing a repository of facts and concepts.\n\nAdditionally, some researchers also recognize other subcategories within declarative memory, such as flashbulb memories (vivid recollections of significant events) and spatial memory (knowledge of the environment and spatial orientation).\n\nOverall, declarative memory plays a crucial role in human cognition, enabling individuals to share information about their lives and the world around them. It is essential for learning, communication, and the formation of personal identity.
