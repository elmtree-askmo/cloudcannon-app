    How is perception defined and how does it differ from sensation?
answer: >-
    Perception is defined as the process by which sensory information is interpreted and consciously experienced. It involves organizing, interpreting, and making sense of the raw sensory data received from the environment. In contrast, sensation refers to the initial detection of stimuli by sensory receptors, which is the first step in the process of perception.\n\nThe key difference between sensation and perception lies in their functions: \n\n- **Sensation** is the physical process of sensing environmental stimuli through our five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell). It is the immediate response of the sensory organs to stimuli, such as light waves hitting the retina or sound waves vibrating the eardrum. For example, when you walk into a kitchen and smell baking cinnamon rolls, the sensation is the detection of the odor by scent receptors.\n\n- **Perception**, on the other hand, is the psychological process that follows sensation. It involves the interpretation of these sensory inputs, allowing us to understand and give meaning to what we sense. Continuing with the previous example, the perception might be the thought, "Mmm, this smells like the bread Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays." This illustrates how perception is influenced by personal experiences and context, transforming raw sensory data into a meaningful experience.\n\nIn summary, while sensation is about the detection of stimuli, perception is about the interpretation and conscious experience of those stimuli. Both processes are fundamental to how we interact with and understand the world around us.
