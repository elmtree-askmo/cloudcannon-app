    Children develop conservation skills related to liquid quantity, mass, weight, and volume during the concrete operational stage of cognitive development, which typically occurs between the ages of 7 and 11 years. This development is characterized by a progressive understanding that certain properties of objects remain unchanged despite changes in their form or arrangement. \n\n### Developmental Sequence of Conservation Skills\n\nThe development of conservation skills follows a predictable sequence:\n\n1. **Conservation of Number**: This is usually the first skill to develop, where children understand that the number of objects remains the same even if they are rearranged.\n2. **Conservation of Length**: Next, children grasp that the length of an object remains constant despite changes in its position or arrangement.\n3. **Conservation of Liquid Quantity**: Children then learn that the amount of liquid remains the same regardless of the shape or size of the container it is in.\n4. **Conservation of Mass**: Following this, they understand that the mass of an object does not change even if its shape is altered.\n5. **Conservation of Weight**: Children also come to realize that the weight of an object remains constant despite changes in its form.\n6. **Conservation of Volume**: Finally, they develop an understanding of volume, recognizing that the volume of a substance remains unchanged despite changes in its container.\n\n### Key Concepts in Conservation Development\n\n- **Desegregation**: This involves the ability to focus on multiple aspects of an object or situation simultaneously, which is crucial for understanding conservation.\n- **Reversibility**: Children learn that actions can be reversed, which helps them understand that changes in form do not affect the underlying properties of objects.\n\n### Horizontal Decalage\n\nThe concept of **horizontal decalage** refers to the gradual development of conservation skills within the same stage. This means that while a child may understand one type of conservation (e.g., liquid quantity), they may not yet grasp others (e.g., mass or weight). This gradual progression illustrates that children build upon their understanding of conservation as they encounter different types of objects and situations.\n\nIn summary, the development of conservation skills in children is a structured process that reflects their growing cognitive abilities, allowing them to understand that certain properties remain constant despite changes in appearance or arrangement.
