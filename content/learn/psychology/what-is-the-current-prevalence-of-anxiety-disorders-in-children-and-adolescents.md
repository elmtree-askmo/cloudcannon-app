    What is the current prevalence of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents?
answer: >-
    The current prevalence of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents is significant and concerning. Estimates suggest that approximately 15% to 20% of children and adolescents meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. More specifically, among adolescents aged 13 to 18 years, the prevalence can be as high as 31.9% (10). \n\nIn recent years, the rates of anxiety disorders have been on the rise. For instance, a study indicated that about 11.6% of children had anxiety in 2012, which represented a 20% increase from 2007. However, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this issue, leading to a nearly doubling of anxiety symptoms among youth, with a meta-analysis reporting that 20.5% of youth worldwide now struggle with anxiety symptoms (3).\n\nFurthermore, it is noted that more than 7% of adolescents aged 13 to 17 have been diagnosed with anxiety, and over 36% of children experience anxiety symptoms (1). These statistics highlight the urgent need for effective identification and intervention strategies to address the mental health crisis affecting children and adolescents today.
