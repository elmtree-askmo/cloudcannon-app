question: >-
    At what age do secondary circular reactions typically develop?
answer: >-
    Secondary circular reactions typically develop between 4 to 8 months of age. During this substage of the sensorimotor stage, infants start to reproduce actions that involve objects in their environment, such as shaking a rattle to hear the sound it makes. This behavior reflects a growing awareness of their surroundings and the effects of their actions on the environment.
