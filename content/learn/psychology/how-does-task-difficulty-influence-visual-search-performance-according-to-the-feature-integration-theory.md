    How does task difficulty influence visual search performance according to the Feature Integration Theory?
answer: >-
    According to Feature Integration Theory (FIT), developed by Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade in 1980, task difficulty significantly influences visual search performance through the mechanisms of feature registration and integration. The theory posits that visual perception occurs in two stages: \n\n1. **Pre-attentive Stage**: In this initial stage, basic features of stimuli (such as color, shape, and orientation) are registered automatically and in parallel across the visual field. This means that if a target is defined by a unique feature that is not present in the distractors, it can be detected quickly and efficiently, leading to a lower task difficulty.\n\n2. **Attentive Stage**: In this subsequent stage, attention is required to integrate these features into a coherent perception of the object. If the target shares features with distractors (for example, if both the target and distractors are red circles), the search becomes more complex and time-consuming, resulting in increased task difficulty.\n\nThe gathered information indicates that when the search target contains a "basic feature" that is not found in the distractors, the search is easier and faster. Conversely, when the target is defined by a conjunction of features (e.g., a red circle among red squares and blue circles), the task becomes more difficult, leading to longer reaction times and potentially lower accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that task difficulty affects not only search accuracy but also reaction times. As task difficulty increases, the cognitive load on the individual also increases, which can lead to poorer performance in visual search tasks. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where attention is divided or time is limited, as individuals may struggle to bind features correctly, resulting in illusory conjunctions.\n\nIn summary, according to Feature Integration Theory, task difficulty influences visual search performance by determining how easily a target can be distinguished from distractors based on the presence or absence of unique features, thereby affecting both the speed and accuracy of the search process.
