    State-dependent learning and context-dependent learning are both phenomena that illustrate how memory retrieval can be influenced by specific conditions present during the encoding of information. However, they differ in the nature of these conditions.\n\n**Context-Dependent Learning** refers to the improved recall of information when the external environment during retrieval matches the environment during encoding. For example, a study by Godden and Baddeley (1975) demonstrated this effect with scuba divers who learned a list of words either underwater or on land. The divers who learned the words underwater recalled them better when tested in the same underwater environment compared to those tested on land. This suggests that the physical context (the underwater setting) serves as a cue that aids memory retrieval.\n\n**State-Dependent Learning**, on the other hand, emphasizes the internal physiological or psychological state of the individual at the time of encoding and retrieval. This means that if a person is in the same emotional or physical state when recalling information as they were when they learned it, they are more likely to retrieve that information successfully. For instance, if someone studies while feeling happy, they may find it easier to recall that information when they are in a similar happy state. Conversely, if they are feeling sad during recall, they may struggle to remember what they learned while happy.\n\n### Examples:\n1. **Context-Dependent Learning Example**: A student studies for an exam in their classroom. When they take the exam in the same classroom, they may find it easier to recall the information because the environmental cues (like the layout of the room, the smell, and the sounds) are the same.\n\n2. **State-Dependent Learning Example**: A person learns a new song while feeling relaxed and calm. If they try to recall the song while feeling anxious or stressed, they may have difficulty. However, if they are able to recreate that relaxed state, they may find it easier to remember the song.\n\nIn summary, while context-dependent learning focuses on the external environment as a cue for memory retrieval, state-dependent learning highlights the importance of the individual's internal state during both encoding and retrieval. Both concepts underscore the complex interplay between various factors that influence memory performance.
