    What were the key findings of Milgram's Experiment?
answer: >-
    The key findings of Milgram's Experiment, conducted by psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, revealed significant insights into human obedience to authority. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **High Rates of Obedience**: Milgram discovered that a striking 65% of participants were willing to administer the maximum shock of 450 volts to a learner, despite hearing their cries of pain and pleas to stop. This demonstrated a strong tendency for individuals to comply with authority figures, even when it conflicted with their personal conscience.\n\n2. **Situational Factors Influencing Disobedience**: While the overall obedience rate was high, Milgram noted that certain conditions could lead to increased disobedience. For instance, when participants were placed in a situation where they could see the learner or when the authority figure was less present, the rate of obedience dropped significantly. In one variation of the experiment, only 10% of participants delivered the maximum shock.\n\n3. **Ethical Concerns**: The experiment raised serious ethical questions regarding the treatment of participants, as they were subjected to extreme psychological stress. This has led to ongoing discussions about the ethics of psychological research and the need for safeguards to protect participants.\n\n4. **Replication and Consistency**: Milgram's findings have been replicated in various cultures and contexts, consistently showing similar results regarding obedience to authority. A notable replication in 2009 by Jerry Burger found that participants obeyed at rates comparable to Milgram's original study, even with modifications to ensure participant safety.\n\n5. **Impact on Understanding Human Behavior**: The results of the Milgram Experiment have had a profound impact on social psychology, providing insights into how ordinary people can commit acts of cruelty under the influence of authority. This has been used to explain historical atrocities, such as the Holocaust, highlighting the dangers of blind obedience.\n\nOverall, Milgram's Experiment remains one of the most significant studies in psychology, illustrating the complex interplay between authority, obedience, and moral judgment.
