answer: >-
    Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development outlines four distinct stages that children progress through as they grow and develop their thinking abilities. Each stage represents a different way of understanding and interacting with the world. Here are the stages in detail:\n\n1. **Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to 2 years)**: In this initial stage, infants learn about the world primarily through their senses and motor activities. They explore their environment by touching, looking, and manipulating objects. Key developments during this stage include the understanding of object permanence, which is the realization that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen.\n\n2. **Preoperational Stage (Ages 2 to 7 years)**: During the preoperational stage, children begin to engage in symbolic play and learn to manipulate symbols, but they do not yet understand concrete logic. They can represent objects with words and images, which allows for imaginative play. However, their thinking is still egocentric, meaning they have difficulty in seeing things from perspectives other than their own. They also struggle with understanding the concept of conservation, which is the idea that quantity does not change even when its shape does.\n\n3. **Concrete Operational Stage (Ages 7 to 11 years)**: In this stage, children start to think logically about concrete events. They gain a better understanding of the concept of conservation and can perform operations that involve tangible objects. Their thinking becomes more organized and logical, allowing them to classify objects and understand the relationships between them. However, their reasoning is still tied to concrete situations and they may struggle with abstract or hypothetical concepts.\n\n4. **Formal Operational Stage (Ages 12 and up)**: The final stage of cognitive development is characterized by the ability to think abstractly, logically, and systematically. Adolescents can formulate hypotheses and consider possibilities, allowing for advanced problem-solving and critical thinking. They can think about abstract concepts such as justice, love, and morality, and can engage in deductive reasoning.\n\nPiaget's theory emphasizes that cognitive development is a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. Each stage builds on the previous one, and children must complete each stage before moving on to the next.
