    The implications of question type on the effectiveness of forensic interviews are significant, particularly in the context of interviewing children who may have experienced trauma. Research indicates that the type of questions posed by interviewers can greatly influence the quality and accuracy of the information disclosed by child witnesses.\n\n1. **Open vs. Closed Questions**: Open-ended questions, such as "Tell me what happened," are generally more effective than closed questions, which often require a simple yes or no response. Open questions encourage children to provide more detailed narratives, allowing them to recall and articulate their experiences more freely. This aligns with the structured NICHD Investigative Interview Protocol, which emphasizes minimizing suggestiveness and contamination by using open-ended prompts and cued invitations (Lamb et al., 2008).\n\n2. **Impact on Self-Contradictions**: The type of questions asked can also affect the likelihood of self-contradictions in children's testimonies. Research has shown that suggestive or leading questions can lead to inconsistencies in children's accounts, as they may feel pressured to conform to the expectations of the interviewer or may misremember details due to the framing of the questions (Lamb & Fauchier, 2001).\n\n3. **Empathy and Questioning**: The effectiveness of open questions may be further enhanced by the level of empathy demonstrated by the interviewer. Empathetic interactions can foster a supportive environment, encouraging children to disclose sensitive information more freely. This suggests that the emotional tone of the interview, alongside the type of questions asked, plays a crucial role in eliciting accurate disclosures (Almeida et al., 2018).\n\n4. **Cultural and Contextual Considerations**: It is also important to consider the cultural background and individual circumstances of the child being interviewed. Tailoring questions to the child's context can improve the effectiveness of the interview. For instance, understanding a child's familiarity with the interview process and their emotional state can guide the interviewer in selecting appropriate question types (APSAC Practice Guidelines, 2023).\n\n5. **Future Research Directions**: There is a need for ongoing research to explore the nuances of question types in various contexts, including the effects of age, developmental differences, and specific trauma experiences on children's responses. This research can inform training programs for forensic interviewers, ensuring they are equipped with evidence-based practices that enhance the reliability of children's disclosures.\n\nIn summary, the type of questions used in forensic interviews has profound implications for the accuracy and completeness of children's disclosures. Open-ended questions, combined with empathetic interviewing techniques and cultural sensitivity, are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of these critical investigative interactions.
