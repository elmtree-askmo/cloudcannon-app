    What are some common framing effects that influence decision-making?
answer: >-
    Framing effects are cognitive biases that significantly influence decision-making by altering how information is presented. Here are some common framing effects that can impact choices:\n\n1. **Positive vs. Negative Framing**: The way information is framed can lead to different decisions even when the underlying facts are the same. For example, a medical treatment described as having a "90% success rate" (positive frame) may be more appealing than one described as having a "10% failure rate" (negative frame), despite both statements conveying the same information.\n\n2. **Gain vs. Loss Framing**: This effect is closely related to prospect theory, which posits that individuals are more sensitive to potential losses than to equivalent gains. For instance, people may be more likely to choose an option that guarantees a gain (e.g., "You will save $100") over one that presents a potential loss (e.g., "You might lose $100"), even if the outcomes are statistically equivalent.\n\n3. **Risky Choice Framing**: When faced with decisions involving risk, the framing of the options can sway preferences. For example, in a scenario where individuals must choose between two medical treatments, one framed in terms of survival rates and the other in terms of mortality rates can lead to different choices, with survival framing often leading to more favorable decisions.\n\n4. **Emotional Framing**: The emotional appeal of how information is presented can also influence decisions. For instance, a political candidate who frames their message in an inspiring and emotional manner may attract more support than one who presents the same ideas in a dry, factual report.\n\n5. **Contextual Framing**: The context in which information is presented can create biases. For example, in legal settings, defendants may be more likely to accept plea bargains when the framing emphasizes the loss of freedom associated with a trial, even if the plea bargain represents a lesser loss.\n\n6. **Social Context Framing**: The perceived social context can also affect decision-making. Research has shown that older adults, who may have limited cognitive resources, are more influenced by how information is framed, often favoring options that are presented in a straightforward and easily accessible manner.\n\nThese framing effects illustrate the power of presentation in shaping human judgment and decision-making, highlighting the importance of critical thinking and awareness of cognitive biases in various contexts, from healthcare to finance and beyond.
