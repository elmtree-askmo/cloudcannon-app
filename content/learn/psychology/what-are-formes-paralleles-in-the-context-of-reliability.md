answer: >-
    In the context of reliability, "Formes Paral·leles" refers to parallel forms reliability, which is a crucial concept in psychometrics. This type of reliability assesses the consistency of scores obtained from two different but equivalent forms of a test that are designed to measure the same construct. \n\nParallel forms reliability is one of the three primary classifications of psychometric reliability, alongside test-retest reliability and internal consistency reliability. The key purpose of parallel forms reliability is to evaluate the degree to which different versions of a test yield similar results when administered to the same group of individuals. For instance, if a teacher creates two versions of a math test, and students' scores are consistent across both versions, this demonstrates strong parallel forms reliability.\n\nThe process for calculating parallel forms reliability typically involves administering both forms of the test to the same group of participants and then measuring the correlation between the scores. A high correlation indicates that the test has strong parallel forms reliability. This method is particularly useful in academic settings where it is important to prevent students from accessing test questions in advance, as it allows for the creation of multiple test versions.\n\nParallel forms reliability is beneficial in various fields, including education and psychology, as it helps to reduce measurement error and ensures that the assessment is consistent across different forms. However, it is important to note that while parallel forms reliability assesses consistency within a test, it does not guarantee comparability with other measures of the same construct.\n\nIn summary, "Formes Paral·leles" or parallel forms reliability is a vital aspect of ensuring the reliability of assessments, allowing researchers and educators to create equivalent test forms that yield consistent results.
