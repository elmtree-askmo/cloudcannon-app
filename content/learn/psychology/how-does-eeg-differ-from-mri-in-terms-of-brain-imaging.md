    How does EEG differ from MRI in terms of brain imaging?
answer: >-
    Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are both valuable neuroimaging techniques used in cognitive neuroscience, but they differ significantly in their methodologies, strengths, and applications.\n\n### Key Differences Between EEG and MRI\n\n1. **Methodology**:\n   - **EEG**: This technique involves placing electrodes on the scalp to measure the electrical activity of the brain. It captures the brain's electrical signals in real-time, providing a continuous record of brain activity.\n   - **MRI**: MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain's structure. It does not measure electrical activity but rather provides high-resolution images of brain anatomy.\n\n2. **Temporal Resolution**:\n   - **EEG**: EEG has excellent temporal resolution, allowing researchers to track brain activity on the order of milliseconds. This makes it particularly useful for studying the timing of cognitive processes and understanding how quickly the brain responds to stimuli.\n   - **MRI**: In contrast, MRI, especially functional MRI (fMRI), has lower temporal resolution, typically on the order of seconds. This means it is less effective for capturing rapid changes in brain activity.\n\n3. **Spatial Resolution**:\n   - **EEG**: While EEG provides great temporal resolution, its spatial resolution is relatively poor. It is challenging to pinpoint the exact location of brain activity due to the nature of the electrical signals being recorded from the scalp.\n   - **MRI**: MRI offers high spatial resolution, allowing for precise localization of brain structures and abnormalities. This makes it effective for identifying tumors, lesions, and other structural changes in the brain.\n\n4. **Applications**:\n   - **EEG**: Commonly used in clinical settings to diagnose conditions such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, as well as in research to study cognitive processes like attention, perception, and language processing.\n   - **MRI**: Primarily used for anatomical imaging and assessing brain structure. Functional MRI (fMRI) is used to study brain activity related to specific tasks or stimuli, providing insights into brain function and connectivity.\n\n5. **Safety and Accessibility**:\n   - **EEG**: Generally considered safe and non-invasive, with minimal risk to the patient. It is also more accessible and less expensive than MRI.\n   - **MRI**: While MRI is also non-invasive, it requires the patient to lie still in a large machine, which can be uncomfortable for some. Additionally, it is more expensive and less accessible than EEG.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, EEG is best suited for studying the timing of brain activity with high temporal resolution, while MRI provides detailed structural images with high spatial resolution. The choice between these techniques often depends on the specific research question or clinical need, as each has its unique strengths and limitations.
