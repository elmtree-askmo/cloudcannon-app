    How does SPI compare to No Suicide Contracts in terms of effectiveness?
answer: >-
    The comparison between Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) and No Suicide Contracts reveals significant differences in effectiveness regarding suicide prevention. \n\nNo Suicide Contracts, also known as contracts for safety, involve a written or verbal agreement between a clinician and a patient, where the patient commits to refraining from suicidal behavior. However, research indicates that these contracts lack empirical support for their effectiveness in preventing suicidal actions. Studies have shown that while they may provide some reassurance to clinicians, they do not significantly reduce the risk of suicide (Kelly and Knudson, 2000; Reid, 1998; Shaffer and Pfeffer, 2001; Stanford et al., 1994). The Joint Commission has recommended the development of collaborative safety plans as a more effective alternative to these contracts.\n\nIn contrast, the Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) has gained recognition as a valuable evidence-based approach in suicide prevention. Systematic reviews have demonstrated that SPI is effective in reducing suicidal ideation and behavior, decreasing depression and hopelessness, and improving treatment attendance. For instance, one study indicated that safety planning could reduce the risk of suicidal behavior by 43% among patients who received such an intervention (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). SPI is adaptable to various settings and can be delivered in multiple formats, making it a flexible and practical tool for clinicians.\n\nIn summary, while No Suicide Contracts may have been widely used in the past, they are not supported by empirical evidence for effectiveness in preventing suicidality. In contrast, SPI is backed by research demonstrating its efficacy in reducing suicide risk, making it a preferred approach in contemporary mental health practice.
