    How does vision influence speech perception, particularly in the McGurk effect?
answer: >-
    The McGurk effect is a fascinating phenomenon that illustrates how visual cues can significantly influence speech perception. It occurs when there is a mismatch between the auditory speech sounds a person hears and the visual movements of a speaker's mouth. For example, if a speaker is saying "baa" while their lips are forming the sound "faa," the listener may perceive a third sound, such as "daa," due to the conflicting auditory and visual information.\n\nResearch has shown that the McGurk effect is particularly pronounced in individuals with certain neurological conditions. For instance, individuals with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain often exhibit a stronger McGurk effect compared to the general population, indicating that visual stimuli play a critical role in their speech perception. However, if the left hemisphere damage affects their ability to perceive visual speech segments, their susceptibility to the McGurk effect may decrease.\n\nAdditionally, the effect is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals, as the processing of visual information related to speech is typically associated with the right hemisphere, while auditory processing is linked to the left hemisphere. In individuals who have undergone callosotomy (a surgical procedure that involves severing the corpus callosum), the McGurk effect persists but is observed to be slower.\n\nInterestingly, children under the age of 10 are less likely to experience the McGurk effect, as they tend to rely less on visual cues for speech perception compared to adults. This suggests that the integration of auditory and visual information in speech perception develops with age.\n\nOverall, the McGurk effect highlights the complex interplay between auditory and visual information in speech perception, demonstrating that our brains actively integrate these sensory inputs to form coherent interpretations of spoken language.
