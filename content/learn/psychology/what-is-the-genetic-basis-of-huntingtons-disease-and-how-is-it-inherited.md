    What is the genetic basis of Huntington's disease, and how is it inherited?
answer: >-
    Huntington's disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, which is located on chromosome 4. This mutation involves an expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeats in the gene, leading to the production of an abnormal form of the huntingtin protein. The accumulation of this mutated protein results in the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, particularly affecting areas involved in movement control, cognition, and emotional regulation.\n\n### Inheritance Pattern\nHuntington's disease follows an **autosomal dominant** inheritance pattern. This means that only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. If a parent carries the mutated HTT gene, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and, consequently, the disease. This inheritance pattern is significant because it allows for the possibility of predicting the risk of developing the disease based on family history.\n\n### Symptoms and Progression\nThe symptoms of Huntington's disease typically manifest in mid-adulthood and include:\n- **Chorea**: Uncontrolled, jerky movements.\n- **Cognitive Decline**: Problems with memory, attention, and decision-making.\n- **Psychiatric Issues**: Depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.\n\nThe disease progresses over time, leading to severe motor and cognitive impairments, ultimately affecting the individual's ability to perform daily activities.\n\n### Genetic Testing\nGenetic testing is available for individuals who may be at risk of Huntington's disease. This testing can confirm the presence of the CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, allowing for early diagnosis and potential planning for future care.\n\nIn summary, Huntington's disease is a hereditary condition caused by a specific genetic mutation, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with significant implications for affected individuals and their families.
