    What are primary circular reactions, and at what age do they typically occur?
answer: >-
    Primary circular reactions are a key aspect of the sensorimotor stage of cognitive development, occurring between the ages of 1 to 4 months. During this substage, infants engage in the repetition of pleasurable actions that involve their own bodies. For example, they may suck their thumbs or kick their legs. Initially, these actions are not intentional; however, as infants discover the pleasure associated with them, they begin to repeat these actions more deliberately.\n\nThis phase is crucial for the development of motor skills and sensory experiences, as it allows infants to explore their own capabilities and gain a sense of control over their movements. The primary circular reactions serve as a foundation for further cognitive development, leading to more complex interactions with the environment in subsequent substages, such as secondary circular reactions, which involve actions directed towards objects.
