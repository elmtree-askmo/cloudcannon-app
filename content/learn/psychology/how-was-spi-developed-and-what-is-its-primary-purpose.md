    How was SPI developed and what is its primary purpose?
answer: >-
    The Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) was developed by Stanley and Brown in 2012 as a brief intervention aimed at reducing the risk of suicide among individuals experiencing suicidal crises, particularly in emergency settings. The primary purpose of the SPI is to create a personalized action plan that helps individuals recognize warning signs of an impending suicidal crisis and take practical steps to cope with these feelings.\n\nThe SPI is typically integrated into the discharge process for patients at risk of suicide, where clinicians collaborate with patients to develop a one-page safety plan. This plan includes several key components:\n\n1. **Recognizing Warning Signs**: Identifying personal triggers that may lead to suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n2. **Coping Strategies**: Employing internal coping mechanisms to manage distress.\n3. **Social Support**: Utilizing social contacts as distractions or sources of support during crises.\n4. **Emergency Contacts**: Listing family members or friends who can provide help.\n5. **Professional Help**: Identifying mental health professionals or agencies to contact in times of need.\n6. **Reducing Lethal Means**: Taking steps to limit access to methods of self-harm.\n\nThe SPI has been recognized as a best practice by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Research indicates that the SPI is effective in improving suicidal ideation and behavior, decreasing depression and hopelessness, and reducing hospitalizations. It is adaptable to various clinical settings and can be delivered in multiple formats, including face-to-face or online, making it a versatile tool in suicide prevention efforts.
