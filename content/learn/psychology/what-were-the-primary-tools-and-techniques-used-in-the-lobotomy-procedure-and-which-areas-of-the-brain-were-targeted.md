    The lobotomy procedure, also known as leucotomy, used various surgical techniques to sever brain connections, primarily targeting the prefrontal cortex and frontal lobes. Key tools included the leukotome and methods like transorbital lobotomy and needle insertion. Its controversial history reflects significant ethical debates and consequences.

answer: >-
    The lobotomy procedure, also known as leucotomy, was a controversial surgical intervention primarily used from the 1930s to the 1950s to treat various psychiatric disorders. The primary tools and techniques used in lobotomy included:\n\n1. **Leukotome**: This was a specialized surgical instrument designed for the procedure. It consisted of a steel tip and a wooden handle, allowing surgeons to sever connections in the brain's white matter.\n\n2. **Transorbital Lobotomy**: Popularized by Walter J. Freeman in the 1940s, this technique involved inserting a pick-like instrument through the eye sockets to access the frontal lobes. This method was seen as a quicker and less invasive alternative to traditional lobotomy.\n\n3. **Needle Insertion**: In some cases, a needle was inserted multiple times to disturb the white matter in the brain, aiming to achieve similar effects as the more invasive methods.\n\n4. **Iridium Use**: Another method involved using iridium to create a fast and effective procedure, although details on this technique are less documented.\n\nThe areas of the brain targeted during lobotomy primarily included:\n\n- **Prefrontal Cortex**: The main focus of lobotomy was to sever the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions involved in emotion, behavior, and cognitive functioning. This area is crucial for decision-making, social behavior, and personality.\n\n- **Frontal Lobes**: The frontal lobes were specifically targeted to disrupt the communication pathways that were believed to contribute to severe psychiatric symptoms.\n\n- **Association Centers**: Surgeons aimed to create a "ditch" around the motor region of the temporal lobe, effectively breaking lines of communication that were thought to exacerbate mental distress.\n\nThe procedure was initially considered a potential "miracle cure" for various mental illnesses, but it often resulted in significant complications, including personality changes, cognitive deficits, and other neurological issues. The ethical implications and the effectiveness of lobotomy have been widely debated, leading to its decline in favor of more humane and effective treatments for mental health disorders.
