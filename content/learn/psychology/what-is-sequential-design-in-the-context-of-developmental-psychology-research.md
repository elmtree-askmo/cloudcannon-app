answer: >-
    In the context of developmental psychology research, sequential design is a methodological approach that combines elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This design allows researchers to examine developmental changes over time while also considering the effects of different age cohorts.\n\nA sequential design typically involves recruiting multiple groups of participants from different age ranges (for example, Groups A, B, and C) and then tracking these groups over a specified period. This approach enables researchers to analyze not only the changes that occur within each age group over time (longitudinal aspect) but also to compare differences between age groups at a single point in time (cross-sectional aspect). \n\nOne of the key advantages of sequential designs is their ability to assess cohort effects, which are variations in development that can be attributed to the specific historical and social contexts experienced by different age groups. By incorporating new cohorts at different times of measurement, researchers can analyze how age, cohort, and time of measurement interact, providing a more nuanced understanding of human development.\n\nFor instance, a sequential study might start with a cross-sectional sample of children aged 5, 10, and 15 years and then follow these groups over several years. This allows researchers to observe how developmental trajectories differ across age groups while also tracking changes within each group over time.\n\nOverall, sequential designs are powerful tools in developmental psychology, as they facilitate comprehensive analyses of developmental processes and the influences of age and historical context on human behavior.
