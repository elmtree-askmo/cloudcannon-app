answer: >-
    Evolutionary psychology integrates Darwinian theory into its framework by examining psychological traits as evolved adaptations that have developed to solve problems related to survival and reproduction. This approach is grounded in the principles of natural selection, which posits that behaviors and mental processes that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce are more likely to be passed on to future generations.\n\nKey aspects of how evolutionary psychology incorporates Darwinian theory include:\n\n1. **Adaptation to Environmental Challenges**: Evolutionary psychology posits that many human behaviors and cognitive processes are adaptations to environmental challenges faced by our ancestors. For instance, the fear of snakes or spiders can be understood as an evolved response to potential threats, enhancing survival by promoting caution in potentially dangerous situations.\n\n2. **Universal Behaviors**: The perspective of evolutionary psychology helps explain why certain behaviors are universal across cultures. For example, social behaviors that promote cooperation and group living can be seen as adaptive traits that increase the chances of survival in social species. The ability to recognize social cues and form relationships is viewed as an evolved trait that enhances group cohesion, which is crucial for survival.\n\n3. **Functionalism Influence**: Evolutionary psychology is influenced by functionalism, which focuses on the purpose of mental processes and behaviors. Functionalists emphasize that mental states are defined by their functions rather than their structures. This aligns with evolutionary psychology's view that psychological traits have evolved to serve adaptive functions, such as mate selection and social behaviors that enhance reproductive success.\n\n4. **Natural Selection as a Driving Force**: The theory of natural selection is central to evolutionary psychology, as it explains how certain psychological traits may have been favored over generations due to their effectiveness in enhancing survival and reproductive success. This perspective allows for a deeper understanding of the evolutionary basis of human behavior and cognition.\n\nIn summary, evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian theory by framing psychological traits as adaptations shaped by natural selection, emphasizing the role of these traits in enhancing survival and reproductive success in the context of human evolution.
