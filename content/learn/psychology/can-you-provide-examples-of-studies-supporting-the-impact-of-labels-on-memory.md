    There are several studies that support the impact of labels on memory, demonstrating how verbal labeling can enhance memory performance in various contexts. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Visual Working Memory and Labeling**: A study investigated the role of verbal labels in a continuous visual working memory task. The researchers tested four hypotheses regarding the labeling effect, concluding that labels can function as retrieval cues, adding distinctiveness to items in memory. This suggests that labeling can enhance the ability to recall visual information by providing an additional verbal representation alongside the visual one (2015).\n\n2. **Age Differences in Memory**: Research has shown that labeling aids visual working memory, particularly in children. In a study involving younger children (ages 5-7), it was found that labeling had a differential impact on visual memory across age groups. This indicates that as children develop, the use of labels may become a more effective strategy for enhancing memory (source not specified).\n\n3. **Perceptual Grouping and Memory**: Another study highlighted how perceptual grouping based on labels, such as categorizing colors as 'warm' or 'cool', influences memory for individual items. This effect was observed even in randomly selected arrays of colors, suggesting that labels can enhance memory by organizing information in a meaningful way (Alvarez, 2011; Brady & Alvarez, 2011).\n\n4. **Labeling Nonsense Pictures**: A specific study demonstrated that labeling nonsense pictures improved memory for them. Participants who viewed labeled pictures performed better in recall tests compared to those who viewed unlabeled pictures. This study indicated that the presence of labels, whether meaningful or not, can enhance memory performance (source not specified).\n\n5. **Overt Labeling Effects**: Research has shown that overt labeling improves memory performance across different age groups. Older adults, in particular, were found to use verbal labels subvocally more than younger adults when performing memory tasks in silence, suggesting that the cognitive strategy of labeling is utilized differently across the lifespan (source not specified).\n\nThese studies collectively illustrate the significant role that labels play in enhancing memory, providing insights into how verbal information interacts with visual memory and cognitive processes.
