    How does explicit memory differ from implicit memory?
answer: >-
    Explicit memory and implicit memory are two distinct types of long-term memory that differ in their processes, awareness, and the types of information they recall.\n\n1. **Definition**:\n   - **Explicit Memory**: This type of memory involves conscious recall of facts and events. It is also known as declarative memory because it requires deliberate thought to retrieve information. Examples include remembering your birthday, recalling historical facts, or recognizing a friend's face.\n   - **Implicit Memory**: In contrast, implicit memory operates unconsciously and automatically. It involves skills and habits that are performed without conscious awareness. For instance, knowing how to ride a bike or play a musical instrument are examples of implicit memory.\n\n2. **Consciousness**:\n   - **Explicit Memory**: Requires conscious effort and awareness to access. When you think about what you learned in school or try to remember a specific event, you are using explicit memory.\n   - **Implicit Memory**: Functions without conscious thought. You may not be actively trying to remember how to perform a task, but you can do it effortlessly due to implicit memory.\n\n3. **Brain Regions**:\n   - Different brain regions are involved in the processing of these two types of memory. Explicit memory is primarily associated with the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, while implicit memory is linked to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.\n\n4. **Learning and Retention**:\n   - Implicit memories are often quicker to learn and retain compared to explicit memories, which typically require more time and repeated exposure to form.\n\n5. **Examples**:\n   - **Explicit Memory Examples**: Recalling your phone number, remembering an important life event, or identifying the current president.\n   - **Implicit Memory Examples**: Knowing how to tie your shoes or ride a bike without thinking about the steps involved.\n\nIn summary, explicit memory is about "knowing that" (facts and events), while implicit memory is about "knowing how" (skills and habits). Both types of memory are essential for our daily functioning and learning processes.
