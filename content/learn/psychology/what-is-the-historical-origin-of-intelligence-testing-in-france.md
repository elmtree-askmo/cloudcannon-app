    What is the historical origin of intelligence testing in France?
answer: >-
    The historical origin of intelligence testing in France can be traced back to the early 20th century, primarily through the work of French psychologist Alfred Binet and his collaborator Théodore Simon. In 1904, the French Minister of Public Instruction established a commission to create tests that would help identify children with intellectual disabilities, ensuring they received appropriate educational support. This initiative was part of a broader effort to reform the educational system and provide adequate resources for all children.\n\nBinet and Simon developed the first practical intelligence test, known as the Binet-Simon scale, which was introduced in 1905. This test was innovative in that it focused on assessing various mental abilities, such as attention and memory, rather than just learned knowledge like mathematics or reading. The Binet-Simon scale became a foundational tool in the field of psychology and education, influencing subsequent intelligence testing methods.\n\nBinet's work was significant not only for its immediate educational applications but also for its long-term impact on the understanding and measurement of human intelligence. His approach laid the groundwork for future developments in intelligence testing, including adaptations by other psychologists, such as Lewis Terman in the United States, who modified the Binet-Simon test into what is now known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.\n\nIn summary, the historical origin of intelligence testing in France is closely linked to the efforts of Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon, who created the first practical intelligence test in response to a governmental initiative aimed at improving educational outcomes for children with learning difficulties.
