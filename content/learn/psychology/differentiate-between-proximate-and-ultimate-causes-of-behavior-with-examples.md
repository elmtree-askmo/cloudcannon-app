    Differentiate between proximate and ultimate causes of behavior with examples.
answer: >-
    Proximate and ultimate causes are two fundamental concepts in understanding animal behavior, each addressing different aspects of why an animal behaves in a certain way.\n\n### Proximate Causes\nProximate causes refer to the immediate, mechanistic explanations for a behavior. These causes focus on the physiological, genetic, neurobiological, and hormonal factors that lead to specific actions. For example:\n\n- **Example**: A bird sings in the spring due to increased daylight, which triggers hormonal changes in its body. The hormone levels stimulate the neural circuits responsible for song production. This hormonal response to environmental cues is a proximate cause of the bird's singing behavior.\n\n### Ultimate Causes\nUltimate causes, on the other hand, explain the evolutionary significance of a behavior. They address the "why" behind a behavior in terms of its adaptive value and contribution to reproductive success. For example:\n\n- **Example**: The same bird's song may serve to attract mates, thereby increasing its chances of reproductive success. This evolutionary advantage of singing is the ultimate cause of the behavior, as it enhances the bird's fitness in terms of passing on its genes to the next generation.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, proximate causes provide insight into the mechanisms that trigger behaviors, while ultimate causes explain the evolutionary reasons behind those behaviors. Understanding both types of causes is essential for a comprehensive view of animal behavior, as they together illustrate how immediate factors and evolutionary pressures shape the actions of animals.
