    Pre-conventional morality is the first level of Lawrence Kohlberg's moral development theory, focusing on self-interest and consequences. It includes two stages: Punishment and Obedience Orientation, where actions are judged by avoidance of punishment, and Instrumental Hedonism, where actions are based on personal gain. This self-centered approach is typical in early childhood.

    Describe the characteristics of pre-conventional morality.
answer: >-
    Pre-conventional morality is the first level in Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, primarily characterized by a focus on self-interest and the consequences of actions. This level consists of two distinct stages:\n\n1. **Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience Orientation**\n   - In this stage, moral reasoning is based on the avoidance of punishment. Individuals judge actions as right or wrong primarily by their consequences, particularly whether they lead to punishment. For example, a child may refrain from stealing a cookie not because they understand that stealing is wrong, but because they fear being punished for it.\n\n2. **Stage 2: Instrumental Hedonism**\n   - At this stage, moral judgments are guided by personal needs and the pursuit of rewards. Actions are considered acceptable if they lead to personal gain or satisfy individual desires. For instance, a child might share their toys with a friend not out of a sense of fairness or kindness, but because they expect to receive something in return or want to avoid being left out.\n\nOverall, pre-conventional morality is characterized by a self-centered approach to ethics, where the primary concern is the immediate consequences of actions rather than broader social rules or ethical principles. This level typically occurs in early childhood, as children begin to navigate their understanding of right and wrong based on their experiences and the reactions of those around them.
