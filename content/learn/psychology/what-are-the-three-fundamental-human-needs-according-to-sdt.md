    What are the three fundamental human needs according to SDT?
answer: >-
    According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the three fundamental human needs are:\n\n1. **Autonomy**: This refers to the need to feel in control of one's own actions and decisions. It emphasizes the importance of having the freedom to choose and engage in activities that are aligned with one's interests and values.\n\n2. **Competence**: This need involves feeling effective and capable in one's interactions with the environment. It is the desire to master tasks and achieve goals, which contributes to a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy.\n\n3. **Relatedness**: This need pertains to the desire to have meaningful connections and relationships with others. It highlights the importance of feeling connected, valued, and understood within social contexts.\n\nThese three needs are considered essential for fostering intrinsic motivation and overall psychological well-being, as they contribute to an individual's ability to engage in activities with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. When these needs are satisfied, individuals are more likely to experience enhanced motivation, persistence, and creativity in their pursuits.
