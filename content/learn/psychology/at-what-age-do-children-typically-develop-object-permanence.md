    At what age do children typically develop object permanence?
answer: >-
    Children typically develop object permanence around the age of 8 to 12 months. This cognitive milestone is a key aspect of the sensorimotor stage of development, as described by psychologist Jean Piaget. During this period, infants begin to understand that objects continue to exist even when they are not visible, which is crucial for their exploration and learning.\n\nFor example, if a toy is hidden under a blanket, a child who has developed object permanence will actively search for it, demonstrating their understanding that the toy still exists despite being out of sight. This understanding is closely linked to the development of mental representations, allowing children to form stable expectations about their environment.\n\nIn summary, while the emergence of object permanence can begin as early as 8 months, it is generally well established by 12 months of age, marking a significant advancement in cognitive development.
