    How does procedural memory differ from classical conditioning in non-declarative memory?
answer: >-
    Procedural memory and classical conditioning are both types of non-declarative memory, but they differ significantly in their nature and function.\n\n**Procedural Memory:**\n- Procedural memory is a type of long-term memory that specifically stores information related to motor skills, habits, and actions. It allows individuals to perform tasks automatically and without conscious effort. For example, riding a bicycle or playing the piano involves procedural memory, as these skills are learned through practice and become automatic over time.\n- It is often described as implicit memory, meaning that it operates below the level of conscious awareness. When a person engages in a task that relies on procedural memory, they may not be able to articulate how they perform the task; they simply do it.\n- Procedural memory is characterized by the ability to learn and execute tasks, and it is typically resistant to age-related decline compared to other memory types.\n\n**Classical Conditioning:**\n- Classical conditioning, on the other hand, is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response. This process involves creating associations between stimuli, such as learning to associate a bell (neutral stimulus) with food (unconditioned stimulus), leading to salivation (conditioned response) when the bell rings.\n- It is also a form of implicit memory, but it focuses on the association between stimuli rather than the execution of motor skills or actions. Classical conditioning is often used to explain how certain emotional responses or reflexive behaviors are learned through experience.\n- This type of memory is more about the relationship between stimuli and responses rather than the performance of tasks.\n\nIn summary, while both procedural memory and classical conditioning fall under the umbrella of non-declarative memory, procedural memory is concerned with the automatic execution of learned skills and actions, whereas classical conditioning involves the association of stimuli to elicit specific responses.
