    What changes in self-esteem are observed during adulthood?
answer: >-
    During adulthood, self-esteem typically follows a specific trajectory that can be influenced by various factors, including gender, cultural context, and life experiences. Based on the gathered information, the changes in self-esteem observed during adulthood can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **High in Childhood**: Self-esteem is generally high during childhood for both genders. This period is characterized by a sense of security and positive self-regard.\n\n2. **Decline in Adolescence**: A notable drop in self-esteem occurs during adolescence. This decline is often attributed to various factors, including peer pressure, body image issues, and the challenges of navigating social relationships. For girls, societal standards of beauty and the pressure to conform can significantly impact their self-esteem during this stage.\n\n3. **Increase in Middle Adulthood**: After the adolescent decline, self-esteem tends to increase through late adolescence and into middle adulthood. This rise can be linked to greater life experience, improved self-acceptance, and the achievement of personal and professional goals. Individuals often develop a clearer sense of identity and self-worth during this period.\n\n4. **Decline in Late Adulthood**: In late adulthood, self-esteem may decline again. This decrease can be influenced by factors such as health issues, loss of loved ones, retirement, and feelings of decreased social relevance. The transition into this stage of life can lead to reflections on past achievements and regrets, which may negatively impact self-esteem.\n\n5. **Gender Differences**: Throughout adulthood, a gender gap in self-esteem persists, with males generally reporting higher self-esteem than females. This gap begins in late childhood and continues into late adulthood. Cultural factors can also influence the size of this gender gap, with larger gaps observed in individualistic and developed countries compared to collectivistic and less developed countries.\n\n6. **Cultural Influences**: The trajectory of self-esteem can vary across different cultural contexts. In individualistic societies, where personal achievement is highly valued, self-esteem may be more closely tied to individual accomplishments. In contrast, collectivistic cultures may emphasize community and social harmony, which can shape self-esteem differently.\n\nIn summary, self-esteem in adulthood is characterized by an initial high level in childhood, a decline during adolescence, an increase through middle adulthood, and a subsequent decline in late adulthood, with notable gender differences and cultural influences shaping these patterns.
