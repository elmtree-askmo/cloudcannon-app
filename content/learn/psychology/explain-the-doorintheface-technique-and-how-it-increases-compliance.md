    Explain the door-in-the-face technique and how it increases compliance.
answer: >-
    The door-in-the-face technique is a well-established compliance strategy that involves making an initial large request that is expected to be rejected, followed by a smaller, more reasonable request. This technique leverages the psychological principle known as the contrast effect, which makes the second request appear more acceptable in comparison to the first.\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Initial Large Request**: The individual (e.g., a fundraiser) starts by asking for something substantial, such as a large donation. This request is intentionally made to be unreasonable, leading to its likely rejection.\n   \n2. **Follow-Up Smaller Request**: After the initial request is declined, the individual then presents a smaller request, which is more reasonable and often more manageable for the recipient (e.g., asking for a smaller donation).\n\n3. **Perception of Concession**: The recipient may perceive the second request as a concession made by the requester, which can create a sense of obligation to reciprocate. This feeling of obligation can increase the likelihood of compliance with the smaller request.\n\n### Example:\nA charity fundraiser might first ask a potential donor for $500 (a large request). When the donor declines, the fundraiser then asks for $50 (the smaller request). The donor, having seen the initial request as excessive, may now view the $50 request as a more reasonable and acceptable option, leading to a higher chance of compliance.\n\n### Psychological Mechanisms:\n- **Contrast Effect**: The stark difference between the two requests makes the second one seem more palatable.\n- **Reciprocity Norm**: The individual may feel a social obligation to comply with the second request after the requester has "conceded" by lowering their demand.\n\nIn summary, the door-in-the-face technique effectively increases compliance by manipulating perceptions of requests through contrast and social norms of reciprocity.
