    What role does behavioural genomics play in studying intelligence?
answer: >-
    Behavioural genomics plays a significant role in studying intelligence by examining how specific genes interact with environmental factors to influence cognitive abilities. This field of research has identified over 50 genes that are associated with intelligence scores, indicating that while individual genes may have small effects, their combined influence can significantly impact cognitive ability.\n\nKey aspects of behavioural genomics in the context of intelligence include:\n\n1. **Gene-Environment Interaction**: Behavioural genomics focuses on understanding how genetic predispositions interact with environmental conditions to shape intelligence. This interaction is crucial because it highlights that intelligence is not solely determined by genetics but is also influenced by external factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and nutrition.\n\n2. **Gene Knockout Studies**: Research often employs gene knockout (KO) studies, where specific genes are removed in animal models to observe the resulting changes in behavior, particularly in learning and memory. For example, the removal of genes implicated in spatial learning can provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of cognitive functions related to intelligence.\n\n3. **Cognitive Abilities**: The identification of specific genes linked to cognitive abilities helps researchers understand the biological basis of intelligence. This can lead to a better understanding of how certain genetic variations may contribute to differences in intelligence among individuals.\n\n4. **Heritability Estimates**: Studies in behavioural genomics contribute to the broader understanding of the heritability of intelligence, which is estimated to range from 40% to 80% based on twin and adoption studies. This suggests a substantial genetic component to intelligence, further emphasizing the importance of behavioural genomics in this field.\n\nIn summary, behavioural genomics provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping intelligence, helping to unravel the biological influences that contribute to cognitive abilities.
