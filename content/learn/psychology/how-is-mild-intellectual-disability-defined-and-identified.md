    How is mild intellectual disability defined and identified?
answer: >-
    Mild intellectual disability (previously referred to as mild mental retardation) is characterized by deficits in intellectual functions, particularly in abstract and theoretical thinking. It affects approximately 1.5% of the population and is identified through a combination of cognitive assessments and evaluations of adaptive functioning.\n\n### Definition and Identification\nMild intellectual disability is defined by an IQ score typically ranging from 50 to 70. Individuals with this level of intellectual disability often have an average mental age between 9 and 12 years. While they may face challenges in academic and social settings, they can learn practical life skills and function daily with minimal support. They may struggle with understanding complex tasks and developing social skills, but with appropriate interventions, they can lead fulfilling lives.\n\n### Diagnostic Criteria\nAccording to the DSM-5, the diagnosis of intellectual disability, including mild intellectual disability, requires meeting three key criteria:\n1. **Deficits in Intellectual Functioning**: This includes limitations in reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience.\n2. **Deficits in Adaptive Functioning**: This refers to difficulties in everyday life skills necessary for independent living, such as communication, social skills, and self-care.\n3. **Onset During the Developmental Period**: The symptoms must manifest during the developmental period, typically before the age of 18.\n\n### Assessment Process\nIdentifying mild intellectual disability involves a comprehensive assessment conducted by professionals such as psychologists and educational specialists. This assessment includes standardized tests to measure cognitive abilities and adaptive skills, allowing for a comparison with the general population. The process is crucial for determining the level of support and intervention needed for the individual.\n\nIn summary, mild intellectual disability is defined by specific cognitive and adaptive challenges, and its identification relies on standardized assessments and adherence to established diagnostic criteria.
