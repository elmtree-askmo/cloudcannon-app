answer: >-
    Cognitive economy in the context of semantic memory models refers to the principle of minimizing cognitive effort and maximizing efficiency in the storage and retrieval of information. This concept suggests that information should be stored in a way that avoids redundancy, allowing for the most efficient use of mental resources. Specifically, cognitive economy posits that properties or features of concepts should be stored at the highest level of abstraction where they apply, rather than being repeated at lower levels.\n\nFor example, if the property "breathes" applies to both "fish" and "mammals," cognitive economy would dictate that this feature is stored at a higher-level category (e.g., "animal") rather than being redundantly stored for each specific instance. This approach helps to streamline cognitive processes, making it easier to access and utilize information without unnecessary duplication.\n\nHowever, there has been some debate regarding the validity of cognitive economy in semantic memory models. Some studies have indicated that the evidence supporting cognitive economy is limited, suggesting that certain models, such as the Semantic Features Model, do not incorporate this principle effectively, leading to the storage of the same features across different concepts without the expected efficiency.\n\nIn summary, cognitive economy is a guiding principle in semantic memory that emphasizes the efficient organization of knowledge to reduce cognitive load, although its application and effectiveness in various models remain subjects of ongoing research and discussion.
