    How do gender differences manifest in physical aggression?
answer: >-
    Gender differences in physical aggression are well-documented, with research consistently indicating that boys are more likely to engage in physical aggression from an early age. This tendency can be observed as early as two years old, where boys exhibit higher levels of physical aggression compared to girls. \n\nSeveral factors contribute to this phenomenon:\n\n1. **Biological Influences**: Hormonal differences, particularly higher levels of testosterone in boys, may play a role in the propensity for physical aggression. This biological factor can influence behavior and aggression levels.\n\n2. **Socialization and Cultural Norms**: Societal expectations and gender role stereotypes often encourage boys to be more assertive and aggressive, while girls are typically socialized to be more nurturing and cooperative. This socialization can lead to boys expressing aggression physically, while girls may be discouraged from such behaviors.\n\n3. **Developmental Vulnerability**: Boys are generally more vulnerable to developmental issues, which can include behavioral problems. This vulnerability may contribute to higher rates of physical aggression among boys.\n\n4. **Relational Aggression**: While boys are more likely to engage in physical aggression, findings regarding relational aggression (which involves harming social relationships) are inconsistent. Some studies suggest that girls may engage in relational aggression more than boys, while others find no significant differences or indicate that boys may also engage in relational aggression.\n\nOverall, the manifestation of physical aggression in boys compared to girls is influenced by a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors, leading to observable differences in aggressive behaviors from a young age.
