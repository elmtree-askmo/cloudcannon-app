answer: >-
    In cognitive neuroscience, the concepts of single dissociation and double dissociation are essential for understanding how different cognitive functions are represented in the brain and how they may be affected by brain damage.\n\n### Single Dissociation\nA single dissociation occurs when one specific cognitive function is impaired while another function remains intact. This suggests that the two functions are supported by different neural mechanisms, but it does not definitively prove that they are completely independent. \n\n**Example of Single Dissociation:**\nConsider a patient who has suffered damage to the ventral stream of the visual system, which is responsible for object recognition (the 'what' pathway). This patient may struggle to recognize objects (impaired object recognition) but can still accurately locate them in space (intact spatial awareness). This indicates that the processes of object recognition and spatial awareness are likely supported by different brain regions.\n\n### Double Dissociation\nDouble dissociation provides a stronger form of evidence for the independence of cognitive functions. It occurs when two different cognitive functions are shown to be independently affected by brain damage in two different patients. This means that one patient has an impairment in one function while performing normally in another, and another patient shows the opposite pattern.\n\n**Example of Double Dissociation:**\nImagine two patients: \n- Patient A has damage that impairs language processing (e.g., Broca's aphasia) but retains spatial awareness.\n- Patient B has damage that affects spatial awareness (e.g., neglect syndrome) but retains language processing abilities.\n\nThis pattern of results demonstrates that language processing and spatial awareness are supported by different neural mechanisms, providing clear evidence for the functional specialization of these cognitive processes.\n\nIn summary, single dissociation indicates that two functions may be related but are not identical, while double dissociation provides stronger evidence for the independence of those functions.
