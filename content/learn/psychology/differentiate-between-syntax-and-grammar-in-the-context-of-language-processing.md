answer: >-
    In the context of language processing, syntax and grammar are closely related concepts, but they refer to different aspects of language structure.\n\n**Syntax** is specifically concerned with the rules that govern the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. It dictates how different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) can be combined and ordered to convey meaning. For example, in English, the sentence "The cat chased the dog" follows a specific syntactic structure (subject-verb-object), while "Chased the dog the cat" does not, making it syntactically incorrect.\n\n**Grammar**, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses the entire system of a language, including syntax, morphology (the structure of words), phonology (the sound system), and semantics (the meaning of words and sentences). Grammar includes all the rules and conventions that govern how language is used, which means that syntax is a subset of grammar.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between syntax and grammar is crucial for effective communication, as it allows individuals to construct meaningful sentences. For instance, the difference in meaning between "The cat chased the dog" and "The dog chased the cat" is a direct result of the syntactic structure, illustrating how syntax can alter the interpretation of a sentence.\n\nIn summary, while syntax focuses on sentence structure, grammar encompasses all linguistic rules, including syntax, that govern language use. This distinction is important in the study of language processing and the neurological underpinnings of language, particularly in relation to areas of the brain such as Broca's area, which is associated with syntax processing.
