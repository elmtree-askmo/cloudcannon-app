    What are the main functions of the cerebrum, diencephalon, and brainstem?
answer: >-
    The brain is a complex organ composed of several key structures, each with distinct functions. The main functions of the cerebrum, diencephalon, and brainstem are as follows:\n\n### Cerebrum\nThe cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for higher cognitive functions. It is divided into four lobes, each associated with specific functions:\n- **Frontal Lobe**: Involved in reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and emotional regulation. It also plays a crucial role in voluntary motor control.\n- **Parietal Lobe**: Processes sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain. It is also involved in spatial orientation and body awareness.\n- **Temporal Lobe**: Responsible for auditory processing and is important for memory and language comprehension.\n- **Occipital Lobe**: Primarily responsible for visual processing.\n\nOverall, the cerebrum handles sensory processing, voluntary motor control, language, and complex cognitive tasks.\n\n### Diencephalon\nThe diencephalon is located beneath the cerebrum and includes structures such as the thalamus and hypothalamus. Its main functions include:\n- **Thalamus**: Acts as a relay station for sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex. It plays a key role in regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness.\n- **Hypothalamus**: Regulates autonomic functions such as temperature control, hunger, thirst, and circadian rhythms. It also plays a significant role in emotional responses and hormonal control.\n\nThe diencephalon integrates sensory input with behavioral outputs and maintains homeostasis within the body.\n\n### Brainstem\nThe brainstem connects the brain to the spinal cord and is crucial for regulating vital life functions. It consists of three main parts: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Its primary functions include:\n- **Regulating Heart Rate and Breathing**: The brainstem controls autonomic functions necessary for survival, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.\n- **Reflex Actions**: It is involved in reflexes such as swallowing, coughing, and sneezing.\n- **Sleep and Arousal**: The pons plays a role in regulating sleep cycles and arousal.\n\nIn summary, the brainstem is essential for maintaining basic life functions and facilitating communication between the brain and the body.\n\nTogether, these three structures—the cerebrum, diencephalon, and brainstem—play critical roles in the overall functioning of the brain and the body, integrating complex cognitive processes with essential life-sustaining functions.
