    How prevalent is ADHD and are there gender differences?
answer: >-
    Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly among children. According to a national survey conducted in 2022, approximately 7 million U.S. children aged 3-17 years, which equates to about 11.4%, have ever been diagnosed with ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD has shown an increasing trend over the years, with studies indicating that the rates have risen from 1997 to 2016.\n\nWhen examining the prevalence of ADHD, significant gender differences are observed. In children, the male-to-female ratio for ADHD diagnoses is approximately 6:1, indicating that boys are diagnosed with ADHD more frequently than girls. This discrepancy is partly attributed to the different ways in which ADHD symptoms manifest in males and females. Boys often exhibit more overt symptoms such as hyperactivity and impulsivity, which are more easily recognized and lead to diagnosis. In contrast, girls may present with symptoms of inattention that are less disruptive and, therefore, more likely to be overlooked or misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as anxiety or personality disorders.\n\nIn adults, the prevalence of ADHD is estimated to be around 4.4%, with a higher rate in males (5.4%) compared to females (3.2%). This trend continues into adulthood, where females with ADHD may experience more severe symptoms of inattention but are less likely to be diagnosed or treated compared to their male counterparts. Research suggests that as individuals age, the gender gap in ADHD diagnoses narrows slightly, with a ratio of approximately 1.6 men diagnosed for every 1 woman.\n\nOverall, understanding these gender differences is crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment strategies for ADHD, as early intervention can significantly enhance outcomes for individuals affected by the disorder.
