    What are the symptoms of contralateral neglect and are there any notable case studies?
answer: >-
    Contralateral neglect, also known as unilateral spatial neglect (USN), is a cognitive disorder that typically arises following damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, particularly the posterior parietal cortex. This condition is characterized by a failure to attend to or respond to stimuli on the side of space opposite to the brain lesion (the contralesional side). The symptoms of contralateral neglect can manifest in various ways, including:\n\n1. **Visual Neglect**: Patients may ignore visual stimuli on the contralesional side. For example, when asked to read a sentence, they might only read the words on the right side, completely neglecting those on the left.\n\n2. **Spatial Awareness Deficits**: Individuals may fail to notice objects or people on the neglected side, leading to difficulties in navigation and interaction with their environment.\n\n3. **Motor Neglect**: Patients may not use limbs on the contralesional side, even though there is no motor impairment. For instance, they might not reach for objects placed on that side.\n\n4. **Perceptual Neglect**: This can include neglect of the left side of individual objects, known as allocentric neglect, where patients fail to perceive the left side of items regardless of their position in space.\n\n5. **Fluctuating Symptoms**: The degree of neglect can vary significantly over time, influenced by factors such as overall arousal and cognitive load. Some patients may show neglect in certain tasks while performing normally in others.\n\nNotable case studies have illustrated the complexities of contralateral neglect. For instance, research has shown that patients can exhibit different types of neglect (e.g., perceptual-attentional versus motor-intentional neglect) and that their performance can fluctuate throughout the day. One significant case study highlighted the preserved ability of a patient to detect symmetry in visual stimuli despite their neglect, suggesting that some cognitive functions may remain intact even in the presence of severe neglect.\n\nOverall, contralateral neglect is a heterogeneous disorder, and its assessment often requires a battery of tests to capture the full extent of the patient's cognitive deficits. The condition is most commonly observed in patients who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke, with incidence rates as high as 82% in post-stroke patients.
