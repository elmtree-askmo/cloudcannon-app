    How does cannabis affect users psychologically?
answer: >-
    Cannabis affects users psychologically in several significant ways, with both short-term and long-term implications. Research indicates that cannabis use can lead to various behavioral and cognitive impairments, particularly when initiated at a young age. \n\n1. **Cognitive Impairments**: Studies have shown that adult cannabis users who began smoking before the age of 17 exhibit significant impairments in executive functioning, which includes skills such as abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, and memory. These cognitive deficits can hinder decision-making and risk-taking abilities, as evidenced by research comparing cannabis users to non-users and users of other substances like cocaine (Pope et al., 2003; Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2006).\n\n2. **Motivation and Goal-Setting**: Chronic cannabis use, especially when started early, is associated with reduced motivation and a diminished desire to work or compete. This can lead to negative outcomes in educational attainment and employment opportunities, as users may be less likely to finish high school or complete a college degree (University of Toronto systematic review).\n\n3. **Mental Health Issues**: Frequent cannabis use has been linked to various mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and an increased risk of developing psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis use and mental health is complex, with evidence suggesting that cannabis can exacerbate pre-existing conditions and contribute to the onset of new psychiatric disorders (Volkow et al.; CDC).\n\n4. **Psychotic Symptoms**: Cannabis use can induce acute psychological effects such as disorientation, anxiety, paranoia, and in some cases, psychosis. Users may experience hallucinations and a distorted sense of reality, particularly with high-potency THC products (Hammond et al.; APA, 2013).\n\n5. **Long-Term Effects**: Longitudinal studies indicate that regular use of cannabis starting in adolescence can lead to long-term cognitive deficits, including memory impairment and a potential lowering of IQ. These effects can persist into adulthood, contributing to poorer job performance and increased risk of mental health disorders (New Zealand study).\n\nIn summary, while cannabis may have some therapeutic benefits, its psychological effects can be detrimental, particularly for young users. The evidence suggests a cautionary approach to cannabis use, especially in populations vulnerable to mental health issues.
