    How do interviewing practices impact the quality and reliability of child testimony?
answer: >-
    Interviewing practices significantly impact the quality and reliability of child testimony, as evidenced by recent research in the field. Effective interviewing techniques can enhance the accuracy of children's accounts, while poor practices can lead to erroneous or misleading testimony.\n\n1. **Interviewer Behavior**: Research indicates that certain interviewer behaviors, such as adopting a relaxed and open posture, can foster a supportive environment that encourages children to provide accurate information. Conversely, disapproving statements or leading questions can evoke inaccurate responses from children (Saywitz et al., 2019; O'Donohue & Fanetti). This highlights the importance of interviewer demeanor in shaping the quality of testimony.\n\n2. **Preparation and Rapport**: The preparatory activities before discussing allegations—such as establishing rapport, setting ground rules, and employing narrative practices—are crucial for eliciting reliable testimony. These practices help children feel comfortable and understood, which can lead to more truthful disclosures (Debra Poole's research).\n\n3. **Suggestibility and Questioning Techniques**: The suggestibility of young witnesses is a critical factor in their testimony. Certain questioning techniques can either mitigate or exacerbate suggestibility. For instance, open-ended questions tend to yield more accurate responses compared to leading or closed questions (Ceci & Bruck, 1995). The use of narrative techniques has also been shown to improve the quality of information provided by children (Yi & Lamb, 2018).\n\n4. **Barriers to Disclosure**: There are inherent barriers that children face when disclosing information, including fear of repercussions or lack of understanding of the questioning process. Interviewers must be trained to recognize and address these barriers to facilitate better communication and disclosure (research findings on barriers to disclosure).\n\n5. **Impact of Interviewing Practices on Credibility**: The way interviews are conducted can influence perceptions of child credibility. Police interviewers' understanding of effective practices is essential for assessing the accuracy and reliability of child testimony. Poorly conducted interviews can lead to skepticism regarding a child's credibility, which can affect legal outcomes (research on police practices and child credibility).\n\nIn summary, the quality and reliability of child testimony are heavily influenced by interviewing practices. Effective techniques that prioritize the child's comfort and understanding can lead to more accurate and credible testimonies, while poor practices can result in inaccuracies and undermine the child's credibility in legal contexts. Continued research and training in best practices are essential for improving the outcomes of child forensic interviews.
