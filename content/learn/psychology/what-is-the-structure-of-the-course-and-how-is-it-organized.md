answer: >-
    The course on visual perception is structured into several key components that facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the subject. It begins with a few introductory classes that lay the groundwork for the subsequent material. The course is organized into three main units:\n\n1. **Low-Level Visual Processing**: This unit covers fundamental aspects of visual perception, including depth, color, and motion processing. It focuses on how the visual system interprets basic visual stimuli.\n\n2. **Visual Attention**: This section delves into the mechanisms of visual attention, exploring how individuals focus on specific aspects of their visual field while ignoring others.\n\n3. **Higher-Level Visual Processing**: The final unit addresses more complex processes such as visual memory, face and object recognition, and visual mental imagery. This part of the course examines how the brain integrates and interprets visual information to form coherent perceptions.\n\nIn addition to these units, the course includes a significant practical component. Students are required to design an experiment for their final paper, which constitutes 40% of their final grade. This experiment should test an idea related to visual perception, often inspired by discussions and readings from the course.\n\nOverall, the course is designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of visual perception, its underlying processes, and its relevance to various fields, including technology and psychology.
