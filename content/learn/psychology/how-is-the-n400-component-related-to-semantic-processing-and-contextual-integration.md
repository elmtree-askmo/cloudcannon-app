    How is the N400 component related to semantic processing and contextual integration?
answer: >-
    The N400 component is a crucial aspect of neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience, particularly in the study of language processing and semantic integration. It is an event-related potential (ERP) that typically occurs approximately 400 milliseconds after the presentation of a word that is semantically incongruent within a given context. This response is indicative of the brain's processing of semantic anomalies, reflecting how well a word fits into the expected meaning of a sentence or discourse.\n\nFor instance, in the sentence "She spread the warm bread with socks," the word "socks" would elicit a larger N400 response because it does not semantically align with the context of the sentence, which is about food preparation. This mismatch signals that the brain is actively engaged in resolving the incongruity, highlighting the importance of semantic processing in language comprehension.\n\nThe N400 is particularly significant because it demonstrates how the brain integrates contextual information to derive meaning. It is often contrasted with the P600 component, which is associated with syntactic processing and reflects the brain's response to syntactic anomalies. The distinction between these two components illustrates the double dissociation between syntax and semantics, where one can be disrupted without affecting the other.\n\nIn summary, the N400 component serves as a marker for semantic processing and contextual integration, providing insights into how the brain interprets language and resolves meaning in real-time. This understanding is essential for exploring various cognitive processes, including those affected by conditions such as aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.
