    What characterizes the 'Orientation of Individual Survival' stage in Gilligan's stages of moral reasoning?
answer: >-
    The 'Orientation of Individual Survival' stage is the first level in Carol Gilligan's model of moral reasoning. This stage is characterized by a focus on self-interest, where individuals prioritize their own needs and desires above all else. Here are the key characteristics of this stage:\n\n1. **Self-Centeredness**: The primary concern is what is best for oneself, often without consideration for the impact of one's actions on others. This reflects a foundational level of moral reasoning that is essential for personal development.\n\n2. **Personal Needs and Desires**: Individuals in this stage are primarily motivated by their own needs, which can lead to decisions that may not take into account the welfare of others. This self-focused perspective is typical in early moral development.\n\n3. **Lack of Consideration for Others**: There is minimal awareness or concern for the consequences of one's actions on others, which can result in a moral reasoning process that is largely egocentric.\n\n4. **Foundation for Progression**: This stage serves as a starting point for moral development, from which individuals can progress to higher stages that incorporate a broader understanding of morality, including the needs and rights of others.\n\nOverall, the 'Orientation of Individual Survival' stage represents a crucial initial phase in Gilligan's theory, highlighting the importance of self-interest in the early stages of moral reasoning before individuals begin to consider the needs of others in subsequent stages.
