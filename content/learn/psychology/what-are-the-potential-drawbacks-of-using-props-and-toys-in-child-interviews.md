    What are the potential drawbacks of using props and toys in child interviews?
answer: >-
    The use of props and toys in child interviews, particularly in forensic settings, has been a topic of considerable debate. While these tools are often believed to facilitate communication and help children express their experiences, there are several potential drawbacks associated with their use:\n\n1. **Risk of Distortion**: Research indicates that the use of props, especially toy-like medical props and anatomical dolls, can lead to distortions and inaccuracies in children's recall of events. Studies have shown that these tools may inadvertently influence the way children remember and report incidents, potentially leading to erroneous touch reports (Bruck et al., 1995; Goodman et al., 1997; Steward & Steward, 1996).\n\n2. **Developmental Appropriateness**: There is a growing concern that the assumption that props are developmentally appropriate for forensic interviews may be misguided. The belief that these aids help children articulate their experiences needs to be critically re-evaluated, as they may not always serve the intended purpose and could complicate the accuracy of the testimony (Bull, 1995; Faller, 2015).\n\n3. **Conceptual Barriers**: The reliance on props is often rooted in long-held assumptions about their effectiveness. This can create conceptual barriers that limit the integration of new research findings into practice. For instance, findings based on one group of children may not be applicable to others, leading to generalized conclusions that do not hold true across different contexts (Steward & Steward, 1996).\n\n4. **Influence on Recall**: The presence of physical objects during interviews can serve as cues that may influence the accuracy of children's recall. While some may argue that props help bridge the gap between a child's understanding and their ability to communicate, the evidence suggests that they can also lead to confusion and inaccuracies in reporting (Bruck et al., 1995).\n\n5. **Need for Alternative Approaches**: Given the potential drawbacks, there is a call for researchers and practitioners to explore new methods for eliciting disclosures from children that do not rely on props. This could involve developing interview techniques that prioritize open-ended questions and supportive environments without the use of physical aids (Goodman et al., 1997).\n\nIn summary, while props and toys are commonly used in child interviews to aid communication, their potential to distort memory and influence recall accuracy raises significant concerns. It is essential for interviewers to critically assess the appropriateness of these tools and consider alternative strategies that may better support children's testimony.
