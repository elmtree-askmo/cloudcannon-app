answer: >-
    Factor analysis is a powerful statistical method used to identify underlying relationships among a large set of variables. However, its application is contingent upon certain conditions and assumptions that must be met to ensure valid results. Here are the key conditions for applying factor analysis:\n\n1. **Sample Size**: A sufficient sample size is crucial for factor analysis. A common rule of thumb is to have at least 20 observations per variable. This helps ensure that the results are stable and generalizable.\n\n2. **Level of Measurement**: The data used in factor analysis should ideally be measured on an interval or ratio scale. This is important because factor analysis relies on the calculation of correlations among variables.\n\n3. **Normality**: The variables should ideally follow a multivariate normal distribution. While some methods of factor extraction can tolerate deviations from normality, significant departures can affect the results.\n\n4. **Linearity**: The relationships among the variables should be linear. Non-linear relationships can lead to misleading results in factor analysis.\n\n5. **Outliers**: Factor analysis is sensitive to outliers, which can distort the results. It is important to identify and address any outliers in the dataset before conducting the analysis.\n\n6. **Factorability**: The dataset should exhibit sufficient correlations among the variables to justify the use of factor analysis. This can be assessed using measures such as the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity.\n\n7. **Relevance of Variables**: The selected variables should be relevant to the constructs being assessed. Irrelevant variables can introduce noise and complicate the factor structure.\n\nBy ensuring these conditions are met, researchers can effectively apply factor analysis to uncover latent constructs and relationships within their data.
