answer: >-
    The Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, commonly referred to as the Big Five Personality Traits, is a widely accepted framework in psychology that categorizes human personality into five broad dimensions. These dimensions are:\n\n1. **Extraversion**: This trait reflects an individual's level of sociability, assertiveness, and emotional expressiveness. High extraversion is characterized by a tendency to seek out social interactions and feel energized by being around others, while low extraversion (or introversion) indicates a preference for solitude and a more reserved demeanor.\n\n2. **Neuroticism**: This dimension measures emotional stability and the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, moodiness, and sadness. Individuals high in neuroticism may struggle with stress and emotional fluctuations, whereas those low in this trait tend to be more emotionally stable and resilient.\n\n3. **Openness to Experience**: Often simply referred to as openness, this trait encompasses a person's willingness to engage with new ideas, experiences, and creative pursuits. High openness is associated with curiosity and a preference for variety, while low openness may indicate a preference for routine and familiarity.\n\n4. **Agreeableness**: This dimension reflects an individual's tendency to be compassionate, cooperative, and trusting towards others. High agreeableness is characterized by a desire to help and empathize with others, while low agreeableness may manifest as competitiveness or a lack of concern for others' feelings.\n\n5. **Conscientiousness**: This trait involves a person's degree of organization, dependability, and goal-directed behavior. High conscientiousness is associated with being disciplined, responsible, and achievement-oriented, while low conscientiousness may indicate a more spontaneous or careless approach to tasks.\n\nThe Five-Factor Model was developed by psychologists Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, and it has become a cornerstone in personality psychology due to its empirical support and ability to predict various life outcomes, including mental health and interpersonal relationships. The model is often summarized using the acronym OCEAN, which stands for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.\n\nResearch has shown that these traits are relatively stable over time and can be measured through various inventories, such as the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP). The Big Five framework is not only useful for understanding individual differences in personality but also has implications for diagnosing personality disorders, as it can help identify maladaptive traits associated with specific disorders.
