    What is the primary distinction between natural selection and sexual selection?
answer: >-
    The primary distinction between natural selection and sexual selection lies in their respective focuses and mechanisms.\n\n**Natural Selection** is a broader evolutionary process where individuals with traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a given environment are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation. This process is driven by environmental pressures, such as predation, competition for resources, and climate conditions. The traits favored by natural selection are those that improve an organism's overall fitness in its environment.\n\n**Sexual Selection**, on the other hand, is a specific type of natural selection that focuses on an individual's ability to obtain mates. It operates through two main mechanisms: \n\n1. **Intersexual Selection**: This occurs when one sex (typically females) selects mates based on certain desirable traits. For example, female peafowls may choose males with the most elaborate plumage, which signals genetic fitness.\n\n2. **Intrasexual Selection**: This involves competition among individuals of the same sex (usually males) for access to mates. Traits that enhance success in these competitions, such as larger size or more formidable antlers, may be favored.\n\nWhile both natural and sexual selection contribute to the evolution of species, sexual selection specifically addresses reproductive success and the traits that influence mate choice and competition, leading to the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In summary, natural selection is about survival in the environment, while sexual selection is about reproductive success and mate acquisition.
