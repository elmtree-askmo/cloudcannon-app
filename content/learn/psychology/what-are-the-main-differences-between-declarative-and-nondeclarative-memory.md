    What are the main differences between declarative and nondeclarative memory?
answer: >-
    The main differences between declarative and nondeclarative memory can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Consciousness**:\n   - **Declarative Memory**: This type of memory is consciously accessible. It involves the ability to explicitly recall and describe facts and events. For example, remembering a specific birthday or the capital of a country falls under declarative memory.\n   - **Nondeclarative Memory**: In contrast, nondeclarative memory is accessed without conscious awareness. It includes implicit memory, which is demonstrated through performance rather than recollection. For instance, knowing how to ride a bike or play a musical instrument relies on nondeclarative memory.\n\n2. **Types of Information**:\n   - **Declarative Memory**: It is further divided into two subtypes: episodic memory (personal experiences and specific events) and semantic memory (general knowledge and facts about the world).\n   - **Nondeclarative Memory**: This encompasses skills and habits, such as riding a bike or typing on a keyboard, which are learned through repetition and practice.\n\n3. **Brain Activity**:\n   - **Declarative Memory**: Research using brain imaging techniques, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), shows that the hippocampus and the right hemisphere are primarily involved during the retrieval of declarative memories.\n   - **Nondeclarative Memory**: The brain regions activated during nondeclarative memory tasks differ, indicating a distinct neural basis for this type of memory.\n\n4. **Learning and Improvement**:\n   - **Declarative Memory**: It allows for the conscious learning and recall of information, which can be refined through study and rehearsal.\n   - **Nondeclarative Memory**: This type of memory is often improved through practice and repetition, leading to automaticity in skills without the need for conscious thought.\n\nIn summary, declarative memory is explicit and involves conscious recollection of facts and events, while nondeclarative memory is implicit and involves skills and habits that are performed automatically.
