    What is the resting potential of a neuron and how is it measured?
answer: >-
    The resting potential of a neuron is the electrical charge difference across the neuronal membrane when the neuron is not actively transmitting a signal. This potential is typically around -70 millivolts (mV), indicating that the inside of the neuron is more negatively charged compared to the outside. \n\n### Measurement of Resting Potential\n\nResting potential is measured using a technique called intracellular recording, which involves inserting a microelectrode into the neuron. The steps involved in measuring resting potential are as follows:\n\n1. **Microelectrode Insertion**: A fine glass or metal electrode is carefully inserted into the neuron. This electrode is capable of detecting the electrical potential inside the cell.\n\n2. **Reference Electrode**: A reference electrode is placed outside the neuron, usually in the extracellular fluid. This electrode serves as a baseline for measuring the potential difference.\n\n3. **Voltage Measurement**: The voltage difference between the microelectrode (inside the neuron) and the reference electrode (outside the neuron) is recorded. The typical value obtained is around -70 mV.\n\n### Factors Influencing Resting Potential\n\nThe resting potential is primarily determined by the distribution of ions across the neuronal membrane, particularly sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-). The following mechanisms contribute to maintaining this potential:\n\n- **Sodium-Potassium Pump**: This active transport mechanism moves 3 Na+ ions out of the neuron and 2 K+ ions into the neuron, creating a concentration gradient that is essential for maintaining the resting potential.\n\n- **Electrostatic Pressure**: Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel, influencing the movement of ions across the membrane.\n\n- **Diffusion**: Ions tend to move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, contributing to the overall charge difference across the membrane.\n\nIn summary, the resting potential is a crucial aspect of neuronal function, allowing for the generation of action potentials and the transmission of electrical signals within the nervous system.
