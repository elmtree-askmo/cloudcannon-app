    What are the key characteristics of psychosis?
answer: >-
    Psychosis is characterized by a significant break from reality, which manifests primarily through two major experiences: delusions and hallucinations. Here are the key characteristics of psychosis:\n\n1. **Delusions**: These are false beliefs that are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary. Individuals experiencing delusions may believe they are being persecuted, have extraordinary abilities, or are under some form of external control.\n\n2. **Hallucinations**: This involves perceiving things that are not present in reality. The most common type of hallucination is auditory, where individuals hear voices or sounds that do not exist. Visual and tactile hallucinations can also occur.\n\n3. **Disorganized Thinking**: People with psychosis may have difficulty organizing their thoughts, leading to incoherent speech or trouble following a conversation.\n\n4. **Negative Symptoms**: These include a reduction in the ability to function normally, such as lack of motivation, withdrawal from social interactions, and diminished emotional expression.\n\n5. **Cognitive Impairments**: Individuals may experience difficulties with attention, memory, and executive functions, which can affect their ability to process information and make decisions.\n\n6. **Loss of Insight**: Many individuals with psychosis may not recognize that their experiences are a result of a mental health condition, which can complicate treatment and management.\n\nPsychosis can occur in various contexts, including primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, as well as secondary to other mental health conditions (e.g., severe depression or bipolar disorder), substance abuse, or medical conditions affecting the brain. Early intervention and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and managing symptoms effectively.
