    What are preference reversals and how do they occur in decision-making?
answer: >-
    Preference reversals are a phenomenon in decision-making where individuals change their preferences based on the context in which choices are presented. This can occur particularly in situations involving joint versus separate evaluations. For instance, a person may prefer a single high-quality product when evaluated in isolation but may choose a bundle of lower-quality items when those options are presented together. \n\nThe underlying mechanism of preference reversals is influenced by how choices are framed. The way options are presented can significantly affect the perceived value of each choice, leading to shifts in preferences. This is closely related to framing effects, where the context or manner in which information is conveyed alters decision outcomes.\n\nResearch has shown that preference reversals can be observed across various species and situations, indicating that this cognitive bias is not limited to humans. The phenomenon highlights the complexities of human decision-making and the impact of contextual features on our choices. \n\nIn summary, preference reversals illustrate how decision-making is not always rational or consistent, as preferences can be swayed by the presentation of options, leading to different choices based on context.
