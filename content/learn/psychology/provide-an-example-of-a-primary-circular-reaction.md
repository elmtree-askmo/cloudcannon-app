    Provide an example of a primary circular reaction.
answer: >-
    An example of a primary circular reaction, which occurs between 1 to 4 months of age, is when an infant discovers the pleasure of sucking their thumb. Initially, this action may happen by chance, but as the infant experiences the soothing sensation, they begin to repeat the action intentionally. This repetition of enjoyable actions involving their own body is characteristic of primary circular reactions, as infants learn to control their movements and derive pleasure from them. Other examples include kicking their legs or waving their arms, which they may also repeat as they find these actions pleasurable.
