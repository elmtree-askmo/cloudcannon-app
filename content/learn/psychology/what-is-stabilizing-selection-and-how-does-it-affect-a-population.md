    What is stabilizing selection and how does it affect a population?
answer: >-
    Stabilizing selection is a type of natural selection that favors individuals with average or intermediate traits within a population, thereby reducing variation and maintaining the status quo of those traits. This form of selection acts against extreme phenotypes, which are often associated with lower fitness or survival rates.\n\nFor example, in the case of human birth weight, both very low and very high weights are linked to higher mortality rates. As a result, individuals with average birth weights are more likely to survive and reproduce, leading to a population that predominantly exhibits this average trait. This process helps to stabilize the population's characteristics over time.\n\nThe effects of stabilizing selection on a population include:\n\n1. **Reduction in Variation**: By favoring average traits, stabilizing selection decreases the frequency of extreme phenotypes, leading to a more homogenous population in terms of the selected traits.\n\n2. **Maintenance of Adaptation**: It helps maintain traits that are well-suited to the current environment, ensuring that the population remains adapted to its ecological niche.\n\n3. **Long-term Stability**: Over generations, stabilizing selection can lead to a stable equilibrium in the population's traits, as the average phenotype becomes more prevalent and extreme variations are less likely to survive.\n\nIn summary, stabilizing selection plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic structure of populations by favoring traits that enhance survival and reproductive success, while simultaneously reducing the diversity of those traits.
