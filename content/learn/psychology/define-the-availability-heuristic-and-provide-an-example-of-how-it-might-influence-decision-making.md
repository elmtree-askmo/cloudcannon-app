    Define the availability heuristic and provide an example of how it might influence decision making.
answer: >-
    The availability heuristic is a cognitive shortcut that individuals use to assess the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples or instances come to mind. This means that if something can be recalled quickly from memory, it is often perceived as more common or more likely to occur than it actually is. This heuristic simplifies decision-making by allowing individuals to rely on immediate examples rather than conducting a thorough analysis.\n\nFor example, consider a manager who has recently experienced several project failures. When faced with a new initiative, the manager might overestimate the risks associated with it because the recent failures are readily available in their memory. This reliance on easily accessible information can lead to a biased assessment of the situation, potentially causing the manager to avoid pursuing the new initiative altogether, even if the circumstances are different and the likelihood of success is higher than they perceive.\n\nConversely, if the same manager recalls several recent successful projects, they may overestimate the likelihood of future success without considering less memorable but critical factors that could impact outcomes. This can lead to overly optimistic planning and decision-making, which may not be grounded in a comprehensive analysis of the situation.\n\nIn summary, the availability heuristic can significantly influence decision-making by skewing perceptions of risk and success based on the immediacy of recalled examples, leading to potentially suboptimal outcomes.
