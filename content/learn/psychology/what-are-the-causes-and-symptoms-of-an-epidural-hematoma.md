    Epidural hematoma is a serious brain injury caused by blood accumulation between the skull and dura mater, often due to trauma. Key symptoms include loss of consciousness, severe headache, and neurological deficits, making rapid medical intervention essential.

    What are the causes and symptoms of an epidural hematoma?
answer: >-
    An epidural hematoma is a type of brain injury characterized by the accumulation of blood between the skull and the dura mater, which is the outermost layer of the meninges surrounding the brain. This condition is often associated with traumatic head injuries, particularly those that involve a fracture of the skull.\n\n### Causes\nThe primary causes of an epidural hematoma include:\n1. **Trauma**: Most commonly, it results from a blow to the head, such as in falls, vehicle accidents, or sports injuries.\n2. **Arterial Injury**: The middle meningeal artery is frequently involved in epidural hematomas. When this artery is torn, it leads to rapid bleeding.\n3. **Skull Fractures**: Fractures at the temporal region of the skull, particularly at the terion (where four skull bones meet), are often associated with epidural hematomas.\n\n### Symptoms\nSymptoms of an epidural hematoma can develop rapidly and may include:\n1. **Loss of Consciousness**: Patients may initially lose consciousness at the time of injury, followed by a period of lucidity (talk and die syndrome) before deteriorating again.\n2. **Headache**: A severe headache may develop as the hematoma expands.\n3. **Nausea and Vomiting**: These symptoms can occur due to increased intracranial pressure.\n4. **Neurological Deficits**: Depending on the location and size of the hematoma, symptoms may include weakness, confusion, seizures, or changes in vision.\n5. **Pupil Changes**: Unequal pupil size or changes in pupil reaction can indicate increased pressure on the brain.\n\n### Clinical Significance\nEpidural hematomas are considered a medical emergency. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are crucial, as the condition can lead to significant brain damage or death if not treated promptly. Treatment often involves surgical intervention to evacuate the hematoma and relieve pressure on the brain.\n\nIn summary, an epidural hematoma is a serious condition resulting from trauma that can lead to rapid deterioration of neurological function. Immediate medical attention is essential for the best outcomes.
