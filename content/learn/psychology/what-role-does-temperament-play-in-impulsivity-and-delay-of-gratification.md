    What role does temperament play in impulsivity and delay of gratification?
answer: >-
    Temperament plays a significant role in impulsivity and the ability to delay gratification, influencing how individuals respond to immediate rewards versus long-term benefits. Research indicates that individual differences in temperamental reactivity, particularly along motivational and affective dimensions, can affect a child's ability to delay gratification. For instance, children with higher levels of arousability may struggle more with delaying gratification due to their heightened emotional responses and impulsive tendencies (Duckworth & Steinberg, 2015).\n\nSpecific temperament traits, such as activity level, emotionality, and sociability, have been shown to correlate with delay of gratification behaviors. For example, a study found that delay of gratification was significantly negatively correlated with activity temperament, suggesting that more active children may find it harder to wait for delayed rewards. In contrast, emotionality and sociability did not show significant correlations with delay of gratification (Table 2, gathered information).\n\nMoreover, self-control, which is closely linked to temperament, encompasses various facets including impulsive choice and action. It has been suggested that certain temperament traits, such as briskness, sensory sensitivity, and low emotional reactivity, support successful self-control (gathered information). This indicates that children with temperamental characteristics that promote calmness and focus may be better equipped to delay gratification.\n\nOverall, temperament influences not only the propensity for impulsivity but also the strategies children employ to manage their impulses. Understanding these individual differences can help in developing targeted interventions to improve self-control and delay of gratification skills in children.
