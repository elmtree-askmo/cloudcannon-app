    What are the main cognitive functions studied in neuroscience?
answer: >-
    Cognitive neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying various cognitive functions. The main cognitive functions studied in neuroscience include:\n\n1. **Perception**: This involves how sensory information is processed and interpreted by the brain. Researchers explore how different brain regions contribute to the perception of visual, auditory, and other sensory stimuli.\n\n2. **Memory**: Cognitive neuroscience examines the processes involved in encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Different types of memory, such as short-term, long-term, and working memory, are studied to understand their neural correlates.\n\n3. **Language**: This function encompasses the understanding and production of language. Studies often focus on how specific brain areas, such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas, are involved in language processing and comprehension.\n\n4. **Attention**: Attention is crucial for cognitive functioning, and neuroscience research investigates how attentional processes are represented in the brain. This includes studying selective attention, divided attention, and the neural mechanisms that facilitate these processes.\n\n5. **Decision-Making**: Cognitive neuroscience explores how individuals make choices and the cognitive processes involved in evaluating options. This includes understanding the role of emotions and cognitive biases in decision-making.\n\n6. **Emotion**: The study of how emotions influence cognitive processes and vice versa is a significant area of research. Neuroscientists investigate the neural circuits involved in emotional regulation and their impact on cognition.\n\n7. **Problem-Solving and Reasoning**: This involves understanding how the brain engages in complex thought processes to solve problems and make logical inferences.\n\n8. **Social Cognition**: This area examines how individuals understand and interact with others, including the cognitive processes involved in empathy, theory of mind, and social decision-making.\n\nCognitive neuroscience employs various research methods, including neuroimaging techniques like fMRI, EEG, and TMS, to investigate these cognitive functions and their neural underpinnings. By combining insights from psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, researchers aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of how brain activity relates to mental functions.
