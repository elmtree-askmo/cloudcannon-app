    How does Alzheimer's disease impact the hippocampus and long-term memory?
answer: >-
    Alzheimer's disease significantly impacts the hippocampus, which is a crucial brain structure for the formation and retrieval of long-term memories. The hippocampus, located in the medial temporal lobe, plays a vital role in converting short-term memories into long-term storage and is essential for spatial navigation.\n\nAs Alzheimer's disease progresses, it leads to the deterioration of the hippocampus. This degeneration results in anterograde amnesia, where individuals find it increasingly difficult to form new memories. In advanced stages of the disease, the ability to retrieve previously stored long-term memories is also compromised. This dual impact on memory formation and retrieval is a hallmark of Alzheimer's, making it challenging for affected individuals to recall recent events or learn new information.\n\nThe relationship between the hippocampus and long-term memory is critical; damage to this area disrupts the normal processes involved in memory consolidation. Consequently, individuals with Alzheimer's may experience confusion, disorientation, and a decline in overall cognitive function, which can severely affect their daily lives and interactions.\n\nIn summary, Alzheimer's disease leads to the deterioration of the hippocampus, resulting in significant impairments in long-term memory formation and retrieval, ultimately affecting the individual's ability to function independently.
