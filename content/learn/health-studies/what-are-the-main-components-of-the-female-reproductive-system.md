    What are the main components of the female reproductive system?
answer: >-
    The main components of the female reproductive system include both internal and external structures that work together to facilitate reproduction. The key internal reproductive organs are:\n\n1. **Ovaries**: These are the female gonads responsible for producing ova (egg cells) and secreting hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.\n\n2. **Fallopian Tubes**: These tubes transport the ova from the ovaries to the uterus. Fertilization of the egg by sperm typically occurs within the fallopian tubes.\n\n3. **Uterus**: Also known as the womb, the uterus is a hollow organ located centrally in the pelvis. It is where a fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus during pregnancy.\n\n4. **Cervix**: This is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It plays a crucial role during childbirth and also serves as a barrier to protect the uterus from infections.\n\n5. **Vagina**: This muscular tube connects the external genitalia to the uterus. It serves as the birth canal during delivery and is also involved in sexual intercourse.\n\nIn addition to these internal organs, the female reproductive system includes external genitalia, collectively known as the vulva, which consists of structures such as the mons pubis, labia majora and minora, clitoris, and vestibule. These external components are involved in sexual arousal and protection of the internal structures.\n\nOverall, the female reproductive system is essential for reproduction, pregnancy, and childbirth, and it also plays a significant role in the hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle.
