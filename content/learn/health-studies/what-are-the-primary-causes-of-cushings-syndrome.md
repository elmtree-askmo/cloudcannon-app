    What are the primary causes of Cushing's Syndrome?
answer: >-
    Cushing's syndrome is primarily caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol, which can arise from both endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external) sources. Here are the main causes:\n\n1. **Iatrogenic Causes**: The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is the long-term use of corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, which are prescribed for various medical conditions like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. This form is often referred to as exogenous Cushing syndrome.\n\n2. **Endogenous Causes**: \n   - **Cushing Disease**: This specific type of Cushing's syndrome results from a pituitary adenoma (a benign tumor of the pituitary gland) that produces excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The elevated ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.\n   - **Adrenal Tumors**: Autonomous secretion of cortisol can occur due to tumors in the adrenal glands themselves, which can be benign or malignant.\n   - **Ectopic ACTH Syndrome**: In some cases, tumors located outside the pituitary gland (such as in the lungs) can produce ACTH, leading to increased cortisol production.\n\n3. **Other Contributing Factors**: Conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and poorly regulated blood glucose levels can increase the risk of developing Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, benign nodular enlargements of the adrenal glands can also contribute to the condition.\n\nIn summary, Cushing's syndrome can be caused by either the excessive production of cortisol due to internal factors (like tumors) or by external factors (like medication use). Understanding these causes is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.
