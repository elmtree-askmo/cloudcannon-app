    Why does the immune system become vulnerable to infections as HIV progresses to AIDS?
answer: >-
    The immune system becomes increasingly vulnerable to infections as HIV progresses to AIDS primarily due to the progressive depletion of CD4+ T-cells, which are crucial for orchestrating the immune response. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the mechanisms involved:\n\n1. **Depletion of CD4+ T-cells**: HIV specifically targets and infects CD4+ T-cells, leading to their gradual loss. This depletion is a hallmark of HIV infection and is closely associated with the impairment of cellular immunity. As the number of CD4+ T-cells declines, the immune system's ability to respond to infections diminishes significantly.\n\n2. **Impairment of Immune Function**: The loss of CD4+ T-cells results in a breakdown of immune homeostasis. CD4+ T-cells play a vital role in activating other immune cells, including B lymphocytes (which produce antibodies) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (which kill infected cells). Without sufficient CD4+ T-cells, these immune responses are weakened, leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections (OIs) and certain cancers.\n\n3. **Chronic Immune Activation**: HIV infection leads to chronic immune activation, which can cause T-cell exhaustion. This state is characterized by increased turnover of T-cells and the presence of activated T-cells that are unable to effectively respond to new infections. The continuous activation of the immune system can also lead to further depletion of CD4+ T-cells and contribute to the overall decline in immune function.\n\n4. **Progression to AIDS**: As the disease progresses, the immune system becomes severely compromised, leading to the clinical definition of AIDS. At this stage, individuals are highly susceptible to a range of opportunistic infections that a healthy immune system would typically be able to fend off. The risk of developing these infections increases significantly as CD4+ T-cell counts fall below critical thresholds.\n\n5. **Impact of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: In the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy, the progression from HIV to AIDS can occur over several years, with untreated individuals experiencing a gradual decline in immune function. ART can help restore CD4+ T-cell counts and improve immune function, but without treatment, the risk of progression to AIDS and associated infections remains high.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability of the immune system to infections as HIV progresses to AIDS is primarily due to the depletion of CD4+ T-cells, impairment of immune responses, chronic immune activation, and the eventual progression to a state where the immune system can no longer effectively combat infections.
