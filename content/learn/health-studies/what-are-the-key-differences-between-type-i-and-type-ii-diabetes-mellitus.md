    What are the key differences between Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus?
answer: >-
    The key differences between Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Etiology**:\n   - **Type I Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)**: This is primarily an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It often manifests suddenly and is typically diagnosed in children or young adults.\n   - **Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: This form of diabetes is largely associated with lifestyle factors and is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. It develops gradually, often in adults, and is linked to obesity, physical inactivity, and genetic predisposition.\n\n2. **Onset of Symptoms**:\n   - **T1DM**: Symptoms tend to appear suddenly and can be severe. Common symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can occur if not managed promptly.\n   - **T2DM**: Symptoms develop more slowly and may be less noticeable initially. They can include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. Many individuals may remain asymptomatic for years before diagnosis.\n\n3. **Prevalence**:\n   - **T1DM**: It accounts for about 5-10% of all diabetes cases, making it less common than Type II.\n   - **T2DM**: This type is much more prevalent, comprising approximately 90-95% of diabetes cases.\n\n4. **Insulin Production**:\n   - **T1DM**: Individuals with Type I diabetes produce little to no insulin due to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, necessitating lifelong insulin therapy for management.\n   - **T2DM**: People with Type II diabetes typically produce insulin, but their bodies are resistant to its effects. Management may initially involve lifestyle changes and oral medications, but some may eventually require insulin therapy.\n\n5. **Management and Treatment**:\n   - **T1DM**: Treatment involves regular insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, along with careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.\n   - **T2DM**: Management may include lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise), oral hypoglycemic agents, and possibly insulin therapy if blood sugar levels remain uncontrolled.\n\n6. **Risk Factors**:\n   - **T1DM**: The exact cause is not fully understood, but genetic factors and autoimmune responses play a significant role.\n   - **T2DM**: Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, and age. Chronic sleep deprivation and poor dietary habits can also increase the risk.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for effective diagnosis, treatment, and management of diabetes mellitus.
