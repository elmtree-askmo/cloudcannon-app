    What is the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems?
answer: >-
    The somatic and autonomic nervous systems are two key components of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), each serving distinct functions related to body control and movement.\n\n1. **Somatic Nervous System (SNS)**:\n   - The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary movements and actions. It controls the skeletal muscles, allowing for conscious control over body movements. This includes activities such as walking, talking, and any other deliberate actions.\n   - The SNS also conveys sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscles, and joints to the central nervous system (CNS), enabling the perception of touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception (the sense of body position).\n   - It consists of motor neurons that originate in the spinal cord and extend to the skeletal muscles, facilitating voluntary muscle contractions.\n\n2. **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**:\n   - In contrast, the autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary bodily functions that occur without conscious control. This includes processes such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and the functioning of internal organs.\n   - The ANS is further divided into two branches: the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for 'fight or flight' responses, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes 'rest and digest' activities.\n   - It operates through a complex network of neurons that control smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and glands, ensuring that essential bodily functions continue without the need for conscious thought.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems lies in the type of movements they control: the somatic nervous system governs voluntary movements, while the autonomic nervous system manages involuntary processes essential for survival.
