    Describe the characteristics of polar covalent bonds and provide an example of a polar molecule.
answer: >-
    Polar covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond that occurs when two atoms share electrons unequally. This unequal sharing results in a molecule that has a slight electrical dipole moment, meaning one end of the molecule has a partial positive charge while the other end has a partial negative charge. The atom that attracts the shared electrons more strongly becomes partially negative, while the other atom becomes partially positive.\n\n### Characteristics of Polar Covalent Bonds:\n1. **Unequal Electron Sharing**: In polar covalent bonds, one atom has a higher electronegativity than the other, leading to an unequal distribution of electron density.\n2. **Partial Charges**: The difference in electronegativity creates partial positive (δ+) and partial negative (δ-) charges within the molecule.\n3. **Molecular Polarity**: The presence of polar covalent bonds contributes to the overall polarity of the molecule, affecting its physical and chemical properties.\n4. **Solubility**: Polar molecules tend to be soluble in polar solvents (like water) due to the interactions between the partial charges.\n\n### Example of a Polar Molecule:\nA classic example of a polar molecule is water (H₂O). In a water molecule, the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, which means it attracts the shared electrons more strongly. As a result, the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge, while the hydrogen atoms carry partial positive charges. This polarity is responsible for many of water's unique properties, such as its high boiling point and ability to dissolve many substances.\n\nIn summary, polar covalent bonds are characterized by unequal sharing of electrons, leading to partial charges and molecular polarity, with water being a prime example of a polar molecule.
