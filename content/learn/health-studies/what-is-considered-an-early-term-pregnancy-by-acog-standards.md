    What is considered an early term pregnancy by ACOG standards?
answer: >-
    According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an early term pregnancy is defined as one that occurs between 37 weeks and 0 days through 38 weeks and 6 days of gestation. This classification is part of a broader effort to provide more specific designations for term pregnancies, which also include full term (39 weeks to 40 weeks and 6 days), late term (41 weeks to 41 weeks and 6 days), and post-term (42 weeks and beyond). These definitions were established to improve clarity in clinical practice and research regarding pregnancy outcomes.
