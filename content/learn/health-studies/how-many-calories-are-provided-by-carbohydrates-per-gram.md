    How many calories are provided by carbohydrates per gram?
answer: >-
    Carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram. This means that for every gram of carbohydrate consumed, you will obtain 4 calories worth of energy. This caloric value is consistent across different types of carbohydrates, whether they are simple sugars or complex carbohydrates. For example, if you consume 10 grams of carbohydrates, you are taking in 40 calories; 25 grams equate to 100 calories, and 100 grams provide 400 calories. Understanding this caloric content is essential for tracking carbohydrate intake and managing dietary needs effectively.
