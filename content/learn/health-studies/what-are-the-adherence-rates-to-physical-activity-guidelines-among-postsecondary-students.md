    What are the adherence rates to physical activity guidelines among post-secondary students?
answer: >-
    Adherence rates to physical activity guidelines among post-secondary students in Canada are notably low. According to data from the 2019-2020 Canadian Campus Wellbeing Survey (CCWS), approximately 50% of post-secondary students do not meet the recommended physical activity guidelines. Specifically, the survey indicated that 50% of students fail to meet the physical activity guidelines, while 44% do not adhere to the sedentary time guidelines. \n\nThe Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity (MVPA) per week and limit sedentary time to less than 8 hours per day. Despite the known benefits of physical activity for mental, cognitive, and physical health, adherence rates among post-secondary students remain concerningly low, with fewer than 50% meeting these guidelines.\n\nFactors influencing adherence include motivations related to athletic performance and physical health. For instance, students who cite improved athletic performance as a reason for engaging in physical activity are more likely to adhere to the guidelines, while those focused on physical health may show lower adherence rates.\n\nOverall, the findings highlight a significant gap in physical activity engagement among post-secondary students, suggesting a need for targeted interventions to promote adherence to physical activity guidelines within this demographic.
