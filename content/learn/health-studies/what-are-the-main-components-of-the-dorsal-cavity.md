    What are the main components of the dorsal cavity?
answer: >-
    The dorsal cavity is one of the two main body cavities in humans, located along the posterior side of the body. It is subdivided into two primary components, each serving distinct functions:\n\n1. **Cranial Cavity**:\n   - **Contents**: Enclosed by the skull, this cavity houses the brain.\n   - **Primary Function**: The cranial cavity provides protection to the brain from physical damage and supports its structure. It is essential for the central nervous system, as it contains not only the brain but also the meninges (protective membranes) and cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and helps maintain its environment.\n\n2. **Vertebral (or Spinal) Cavity**:\n   - **Contents**: Formed by the vertebral column, this cavity houses the spinal cord.\n   - **Primary Function**: The vertebral cavity protects the spinal cord, which is a critical component of the central nervous system. It facilitates the transmission of nerve signals between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nTogether, these components of the dorsal cavity play a crucial role in protecting the central nervous system and supporting its functions.
