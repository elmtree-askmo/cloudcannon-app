    What is the format for True or False questions in the examination?
answer: >-
    The format for True or False questions in the Fiji Year 8 Examination typically involves a table where students are required to tick one box in each row to indicate whether a given statement is TRUE or FALSE. For example, in the Healthy Living assessment, a section may be designated for True or False questions, and students would respond by marking their answers accordingly. This format allows for straightforward evaluation and quick feedback on students' understanding of the material. \n\nTrue or False questions are beneficial in assessments as they enhance retention and understanding, simplify the grading process, and encourage critical thinking. By ensuring clarity in the statements and avoiding double negatives, educators can create effective assessments that accurately measure students' knowledge.
