answer: >-
    Organ classification is a systematic approach to categorizing organs based on their structure and function. The primary criteria for organ classification include the physical characteristics of the organs and their roles within the body systems. Here are the main categories and examples:\n\n1. **Solid Organs**: These organs have a defined structure and are typically involved in specific physiological functions. They do not have a lumen (internal cavity) and are often involved in processes such as filtration, secretion, or circulation. Examples include:\n   - **Liver**: Involved in metabolism, detoxification, and bile production.\n   - **Kidneys**: Responsible for filtering blood and producing urine.\n   - **Heart**: Pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients.\n\n2. **Hollow Organs**: These organs possess a lumen and are involved in processes that require the passage of substances. They often play critical roles in digestion, excretion, and reproduction. Examples include:\n   - **Stomach**: Aids in digestion by breaking down food and mixing it with digestive juices.\n   - **Intestines**: Involved in nutrient absorption and waste excretion.\n   - **Bladder**: Stores urine before it is excreted from the body.\n\nUnderstanding organ classification is essential for studying anatomy and physiology, as it helps in identifying the roles of different organs within the body and their interactions within various organ systems. This classification also aids in medical practice, diagnostics, and understanding the implications of organ dysfunction.
