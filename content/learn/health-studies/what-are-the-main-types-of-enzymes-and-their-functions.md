    What are the main types of enzymes and their functions?
answer: >-
    Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions in living organisms. They are primarily proteins and play crucial roles in various metabolic processes. The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) classifies enzymes into six main classes based on the type of reaction they catalyze. Here are the main types of enzymes and their functions:\n\n1. **Oxidoreductases**: These enzymes catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, where the transfer of electrons occurs between molecules. An example is Alcohol Dehydrogenase, which converts alcohol to aldehyde or ketone while reducing NAD+ to NADH.\n\n2. **Transferases**: These enzymes facilitate the transfer of functional groups (like methyl or phosphate groups) from one molecule to another. For instance, aminotransferases transfer amino groups between amino acids and keto acids.\n\n3. **Hydrolases**: These enzymes catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of various bonds, including C-O, C-N, and C-C bonds, by adding water. A common example is lipase, which breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol.\n\n4. **Lyases**: Lyases catalyze the cleavage of bonds by means other than hydrolysis or oxidation, often forming double bonds or rings. An example is pyruvate decarboxylase, which removes a carboxyl group from pyruvate.\n\n5. **Isomerases**: These enzymes catalyze the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule, converting one isomer into another. An example is phosphoglucose isomerase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate.\n\n6. **Ligases**: Ligases catalyze the joining of two molecules with the concomitant hydrolysis of a diphosphate bond in ATP or another nucleoside triphosphate. An example is DNA ligase, which joins Okazaki fragments during DNA replication.\n\nEach class of enzymes plays a specific role in metabolic pathways, ensuring the efficient execution of biochemical reactions necessary for life. Enzymes are essential for processes such as digestion, energy production, and cellular signaling, and their activity can be regulated through various mechanisms to maintain homeostasis within the body.
