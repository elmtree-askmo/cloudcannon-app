    What are the key stages of sleep identified through polysomnography?
answer: >-
    Polysomnography (PSG) is a comprehensive sleep study that records various physiological parameters during sleep to identify different sleep stages and diagnose sleep disorders. The key stages of sleep identified through polysomnography include:\n\n1. **NREM Stage 1 (N1)**: This is the lightest stage of sleep, marking the transition from wakefulness to sleep. It typically lasts a few minutes and is characterized by a decrease in muscle activity and a shift in brain wave patterns.\n\n2. **NREM Stage 2 (N2)**: This stage represents a deeper sleep than N1 and accounts for about 50% of total sleep time in adults. It is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes in the EEG, indicating a further reduction in awareness of the external environment.\n\n3. **NREM Stage 3 (N3)**: Also known as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep, this stage is crucial for restorative processes in the body. It is characterized by delta waves in the EEG and is associated with the highest levels of sleep intensity. This stage is important for physical recovery and growth.\n\n4. **REM Sleep**: Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep typically occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep and is characterized by increased brain activity, vivid dreaming, and temporary muscle paralysis. The EEG during REM sleep resembles that of an awake state, making it difficult to distinguish from wakefulness without additional measures like electromyography (EMG) to confirm muscle atonia.\n\nThese stages cycle throughout the night, with a typical sleep cycle lasting about 90 minutes, repeating four to five times during a normal night of sleep. The distribution of these stages can vary based on age, health, and other factors, and polysomnography plays a critical role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders.
