    What is meconium and how does it differ from regular stool?
answer: >-
    Meconium is the first stool that a newborn baby passes, typically within the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. It is composed of materials ingested while in the uterus, including amniotic fluid, intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo (fine hair), and mucus. Meconium is characterized by its dark green or black color and its thick, sticky, tar-like consistency.\n\nIn contrast, regular stool, which follows meconium, varies in color and consistency depending on the baby's diet. For instance, breastfed infants usually produce yellowish, soft, and seedy stools, while formula-fed infants tend to have thicker, brownish stools. As the baby begins to consume solid foods, the stool will further change in texture and odor.\n\nThe key differences between meconium and regular stool are:\n\n1. **Color**: Meconium is dark green to black, while regular stool can be yellow, brown, or green depending on the baby's diet.\n2. **Consistency**: Meconium is thick and sticky, whereas regular stool is generally softer and less viscous.\n3. **Composition**: Meconium consists of materials ingested in utero, while regular stool is primarily composed of digested food and waste products.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is important for monitoring a newborn's health and development, as the passage of meconium is a normal part of the adaptation process after birth.
