    What is the primary purpose of the International Standard Classification of Health Workers?
answer: >-
    The primary purpose of the International Standard Classification of Health Workers (ISCO) is to provide a structured framework for classifying health workers in a way that facilitates international communication and enhances the comparability of health worker data across different countries and over time. This classification system is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO, 2008 revision) and is designed to aggregate occupational information obtained from various sources, including population censuses, surveys, and administrative records.\n\nThe ISCO categorizes health workers into five broad groupings: health professionals, health associate professionals, personal care workers, health management and support personnel, and other health service providers. This hierarchical structure allows for a clear mapping of health occupations based on skill level and specialization, which is essential for effective global health workforce management and data improvement.\n\nBy standardizing the classification of health workers, the ISCO aims to make it possible for data and information on health workers from different sources to be produced and compared effectively, thereby supporting research, decision-making, and action-oriented initiatives in health workforce planning and development.
