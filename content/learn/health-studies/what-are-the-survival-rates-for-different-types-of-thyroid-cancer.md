    What are the survival rates for different types of thyroid cancer?
answer: >-
    The survival rates for different types of thyroid cancer can vary significantly based on the type of cancer, its stage at diagnosis, and other individual factors such as age and overall health. Here is a summary of the 5-year relative survival rates for the main types of thyroid cancer:\n\n1. **Papillary Thyroid Cancer**: This is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is nearly 100% when diagnosed and treated at an early stage.\n\n2. **Follicular Thyroid Cancer**: Similar to papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer also has a high survival rate. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 92% or higher, particularly for localized and regional stages.\n\n3. **Medullary Thyroid Cancer**: The prognosis for medullary thyroid cancer is generally lower than that for papillary and follicular types. The 5-year survival rate is around 92% for localized cases but can decrease significantly if the cancer has spread.\n\n4. **Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer**: This is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer and has a poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is significantly lower, often reported to be less than 10%, due to its rapid growth and resistance to treatment.\n\nOverall, the 5-year relative survival rate for thyroid cancer is quite high, with most types showing rates above 90% when diagnosed early. Factors such as the stage of cancer at diagnosis, the specific type of thyroid cancer, and the patient's overall health play crucial roles in determining individual outcomes.
