answer: >-
    Effective time management during the Fiji Year 8 Examination is crucial for students to maximize their performance and reduce stress. Here are some strategies that students can employ to manage their time effectively during the exam:\n\n1. **Familiarize with the Exam Format**: Before starting the exam, take a few minutes to read through the entire question paper. This helps you understand the structure and identify which sections may require more time based on their difficulty and point value.\n\n2. **Prioritize Questions**: Start with the questions you find easiest. This approach builds confidence and ensures that you secure marks early on. Leave more challenging questions for later, as this can help with problem-solving and time management.\n\n3. **Allocate Time Wisely**: Assign specific time slots to each question or section based on their marks. For instance, if a question is worth more points, allocate more time to it. This structured approach helps you stick to your time plan.\n\n4. **Use Elimination Techniques**: For multiple-choice questions, read each question carefully and try to eliminate obviously incorrect answers. This can save time and increase your chances of selecting the correct option.\n\n5. **Stay Calm and Focused**: Managing stress is essential. Take deep breaths if you feel overwhelmed, and maintain a positive mindset throughout the exam.\n\n6. **Keep Track of Time**: Regularly check the time to ensure you are on track. If you find yourself spending too long on a question, it may be wise to move on and return to it later if time permits.\n\n7. **Practice with Sample Papers**: Familiarizing yourself with the exam format through practice papers can enhance your time management skills and improve your problem-solving abilities.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, students can navigate the Fiji Year 8 Examination more effectively, ensuring they make the most of their time and perform to the best of their abilities.
