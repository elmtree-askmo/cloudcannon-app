    Define endocytosis and exocytosis and explain their roles in cellular transport.
answer: >-
    Endocytosis and exocytosis are two fundamental processes that cells use to transport materials across their membranes, particularly when dealing with substances that are too large to pass through the lipid bilayer or transport proteins.\n\n### Endocytosis\nEndocytosis is the process by which cells internalize substances from their external environment. This occurs through the engulfing of materials into a membrane-bound vesicle. There are several types of endocytosis:\n\n1. **Phagocytosis**: Often referred to as "cell eating," this process involves the engulfing of large particles, such as bacteria or dead cells. The cell membrane extends around the particle and forms a vesicle that brings it into the cell.\n\n2. **Pinocytosis**: Known as "cell drinking," this process involves the uptake of small droplets of extracellular fluid along with dissolved solutes. The cell membrane invaginates to form small vesicles that capture the fluid.\n\n3. **Receptor-mediated endocytosis**: This is a more selective form of endocytosis where specific molecules bind to receptors on the cell surface. Once the binding occurs, the cell membrane invaginates and forms a vesicle containing the bound molecules.\n\nEndocytosis is crucial for various cellular functions, including nutrient uptake, immune responses, and the regulation of cell surface receptors.\n\n### Exocytosis\nExocytosis is the process by which cells expel materials from their interior to the exterior. This is achieved when vesicles containing the materials fuse with the plasma membrane, allowing the contents to be released outside the cell. Key roles of exocytosis include:\n\n1. **Secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters**: In endocrine cells, exocytosis is responsible for releasing hormones into the bloodstream, while in neurons, it facilitates the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, enabling communication between nerve cells.\n\n2. **Removal of waste products**: Exocytosis helps in expelling waste materials from the cell, maintaining cellular health.\n\n3. **Cell membrane repair**: The process can also contribute to the repair of the plasma membrane by adding new membrane material.\n\nBoth endocytosis and exocytosis are energy-dependent processes that play critical roles in maintaining cellular function and communication. They allow cells to manage the import and export of large molecules and particles, which is essential for various biological activities.
