    How is active immunity acquired?
answer: >-
    Active immunity is acquired when an individual's immune system produces its own antibodies in response to exposure to a pathogen or through vaccination. This process involves the activation of the adaptive immune system, which includes the proliferation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes that specifically target the pathogen.\n\nThere are two main types of active immunity:\n\n1. **Natural Active Immunity**: This occurs when a person is exposed to a pathogen in their environment, such as through infection. For example, when someone contracts a disease like chickenpox, their immune system responds by producing antibodies against the virus, leading to long-term immunity.\n\n2. **Artificial Active Immunity**: This is achieved through vaccination, where a person is exposed to a harmless part of the pathogen (such as a weakened or inactivated form of the virus, or a piece of its protein). Edward Jenner's work in the 1790s with cowpox and smallpox is a historical example of artificial active immunity, demonstrating how exposure to a related pathogen can confer immunity to a more dangerous one.\n\nThe key distinction between active and passive immunity is that active immunity involves the individual's own immune response, resulting in the formation of memory cells that provide long-lasting protection. In contrast, passive immunity involves the introduction of antibodies produced by another organism, which provides immediate but temporary protection.\n\nOverall, active immunity is a crucial aspect of the immune response, enabling the body to develop a robust defense against future infections by the same pathogen.
