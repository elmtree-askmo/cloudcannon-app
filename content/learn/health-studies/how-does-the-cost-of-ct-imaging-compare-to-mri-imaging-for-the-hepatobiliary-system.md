    How does the cost of CT imaging compare to MRI imaging for the hepatobiliary system?
answer: >-
    The cost of CT imaging and MRI imaging for the hepatobiliary system can vary significantly based on several factors, including the facility type (hospital vs. stand-alone imaging center) and geographic location. According to the gathered information, the average cost of an MRI in a hospital setting is approximately $2,550, while the cost at a stand-alone imaging center can be as low as $650. In contrast, specific cost data for CT imaging was not provided in the gathered information, but it is generally known that CT scans tend to be less expensive than MRI scans.\n\nAdditionally, cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that MRI may not always be the most cost-effective option for certain imaging strategies, particularly when compared to other modalities like ultrasound (US) and CT. For instance, one study found that MRI surveillance had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) exceeding USD 100,000, suggesting that it may be less cost-effective in some scenarios.\n\nIn summary, while MRI imaging for the hepatobiliary system is typically more expensive than CT imaging, the exact costs can vary widely based on the type of facility and other factors.
