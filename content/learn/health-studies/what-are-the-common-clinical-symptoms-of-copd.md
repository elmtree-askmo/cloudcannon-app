    What are the common clinical symptoms of COPD?
answer: >-
    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. The most common symptoms of COPD include:\n\n1. **Shortness of Breath**: This is often the first noticeable symptom, particularly during physical activities. Patients may feel that breathing requires more effort or may experience gasping for air.\n\n2. **Chronic Cough**: A persistent cough is typical, which may produce sputum (mucus or phlegm). This cough is sometimes referred to as a "smoker's cough" and can be one of the earliest signs of the disease.\n\n3. **Wheezing**: Patients may experience wheezing, which is a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing, particularly during exhalation.\n\n4. **Chest Tightness**: Many individuals report a feeling of tightness in the chest, which can accompany other respiratory symptoms.\n\n5. **Fatigue**: Chronic fatigue or tiredness is common among those with COPD, often due to the increased effort required for breathing.\n\n6. **Recurrent Respiratory Infections**: Individuals with COPD may experience frequent lung infections, such as acute bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\nAs COPD progresses, these symptoms typically worsen, making daily activities increasingly difficult. It is important for individuals experiencing these symptoms, especially those over 35 who smoke or have a history of smoking, to seek medical advice for proper diagnosis and management.
