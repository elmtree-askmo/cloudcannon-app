    The 2018 IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) presents critical findings regarding the impacts of global warming and the necessary pathways to limit temperature rise. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Temperature Thresholds**: The report emphasizes the significant differences in impacts between a global temperature increase of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Limiting warming to 1.5°C could reduce the risks of severe climate impacts, including extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n2. **Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: To limit warming to 1.5°C, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions must be reduced by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net-zero around 2050. This requires rapid and unprecedented changes across all aspects of society.\n\n3. **Impacts on Ecosystems and Human Systems**: The report outlines that at 1.5°C of warming, there will still be significant impacts on ecosystems, such as coral reefs, which are projected to decline by 70-90%. In contrast, at 2°C, nearly all coral reefs are expected to be lost.\n\n4. **Adaptation and Resilience**: The report highlights the importance of adaptation strategies to manage the impacts of climate change. It stresses that limiting warming to 1.5°C will require not only mitigation efforts but also enhanced resilience and adaptation measures.\n\n5. **Socio-Economic Considerations**: The findings indicate that achieving the 1.5°C target is not only an environmental issue but also a socio-economic challenge. It requires global cooperation and significant investment in sustainable development, technology, and infrastructure.\n\n6. **Pathways to Achieve Targets**: The report outlines various pathways to achieve the 1.5°C target, including the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture technologies. It emphasizes the need for immediate and sustained efforts to transition to low-carbon economies.\n\n7. **Public Engagement and Policy**: The report calls for increased public awareness and engagement in climate action, as well as the need for strong policy frameworks to support the transition to a sustainable future.\n\nOverall, the 2018 IPCC Special Report serves as a crucial document for policymakers, scientists, and the public, highlighting the urgent need for action to mitigate climate change and its impacts.
