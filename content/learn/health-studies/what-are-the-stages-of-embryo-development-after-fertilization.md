    What are the stages of embryo development after fertilization?
answer: >-
    The stages of embryo development after fertilization can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Fertilization**: The process begins when a sperm cell successfully fuses with an egg cell, forming a zygote. This event is tightly regulated to ensure that only one sperm penetrates the egg.\n\n2. **Cleavage**: Shortly after fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of mitotic divisions known as cleavage. This results in the formation of a multicellular structure called the blastula, which is often a hollow ball of cells.\n\n3. **Gastrulation**: Following cleavage, the blastula undergoes gastrulation, a critical phase where the single-layered blastula reorganizes into a multi-layered structure known as the gastrula. This process establishes the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which will later differentiate into various tissues and organs.\n\n4. **Embryonic Development**: The embryo develops within the amniotic sac, which forms under the lining of the uterus. This stage is characterized by the formation of most internal organs and external body structures. Notably, the heart and major blood vessels begin to develop around 16 days after fertilization.\n\n5. **Organogenesis**: This phase occurs from approximately the third to the eighth week of development. During organogenesis, the major organs and organ systems begin to form. The embryo is connected to the trophoblastic shell via a narrow stalk that develops into the umbilical cord, facilitating nutrient and gas exchange with the placenta.\n\n6. **Neural Development**: By the end of the fourth week, the neural tube, which will develop into the central nervous system, begins to form. The cranial and caudal neuropores close completely by around day 26.\n\n7. **Further Development**: By the end of the eighth week, the embryo has developed many of its critical structures, including the beginnings of limbs, facial features, and internal organs. This period is crucial as it encompasses the majority of the critical steps in organ formation.\n\n8. **Transition to Fetal Stage**: After the eighth week, the developing organism is referred to as a fetus, and the focus shifts to growth and maturation of the already formed organs and systems until birth.\n\nThese stages highlight the complexity and precision of human embryonic development, which is essential for the proper formation of a healthy fetus.
