    What are the stages of oogenesis and what occurs during each stage?
answer: >-
    Oogenesis is the process of female gametogenesis, which involves the development of oocytes (egg cells) in the ovaries. This intricate process occurs in several stages, each characterized by specific developmental milestones and hormonal regulation. Here are the key stages of oogenesis:\n\n1. **Oogonia Stage**: \n   - Oogenesis begins with the formation of oogonia, which are diploid (2n) germ cells. These cells are formed during fetal development and undergo mitosis to increase in number. Oogonia are present in the ovaries before birth.\n\n2. **Primary Oocyte Stage**: \n   - Before birth, some oogonia differentiate into primary oocytes, which are also diploid. This transition occurs during fetal development, and the primary oocytes enter the first meiotic division but are arrested in prophase I. This arrest can last for many years, often until puberty.\n\n3. **Secondary Oocyte Stage**: \n   - At puberty, hormonal changes trigger the resumption of meiosis in a selected number of primary oocytes during each menstrual cycle. The primary oocyte completes the first meiotic division, resulting in a secondary oocyte (haploid, 1n) and a smaller polar body, which typically degenerates. The secondary oocyte then enters the second meiotic division but is arrested in metaphase II.\n\n4. **Ovum Stage**: \n   - The secondary oocyte is released from the ovary during ovulation. If fertilization occurs, the secondary oocyte completes the second meiotic division, resulting in the formation of a mature ovum (haploid) and another polar body. The mature ovum is then capable of being fertilized by a sperm cell.\n\nThroughout these stages, hormonal regulation plays a crucial role. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the growth and maturation of the follicles, while luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation and the subsequent formation of the corpus luteum. The entire process of oogenesis is continuous but occurs in a cyclical manner, with only a limited number of oocytes maturing during each menstrual cycle.\n\nIn summary, oogenesis involves the transformation of oogonia into mature ova through a series of stages: oogonia → primary oocytes → secondary oocytes → ovum, with significant hormonal regulation at each step.
