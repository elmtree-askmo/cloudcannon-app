    How is true digestibility measured?
answer: >-
    True digestibility is a more precise measure of nutrient absorption compared to apparent digestibility, as it accounts for endogenous lossesâ€”substances that are secreted into the digestive tract and not derived from the feed itself. Measuring true digestibility can be challenging due to the difficulty in estimating these endogenous losses. Here are some methods used to measure true digestibility:\n\n1. **Oro-Ileal Balance Method**: This method involves invasive techniques such as naso-ileal intubation or fistulation at the terminal ileum in healthy participants. It allows for the collection of digesta at the ileum to measure the true ileal digestibility of individual indispensable amino acids (IAAs).\n\n2. **Metabolic Fecal Nitrogen (MFN) Excretion**: The estimated value of true digestibility for food and feed proteins is often dependent on the excretion of MFN. This approach helps in correcting the digestibility values by accounting for nitrogen that is not derived from the feed.\n\n3. **Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)**: This scoring method, adopted by FAO/WHO, is used to measure the protein value in human nutrition. It corrects the digestibility percentage for the true fecal digestibility of the test protein, often using data from rat assays.\n\n4. **Dual-Stable-Isotope Method**: An innovative and minimally invasive technique involves the ingestion of a test protein labeled with deuterium (2H) alongside a standard protein labeled with carbon-13 (13C). This allows for accurate measurement of digestion and absorption of the labeled protein.\n\n5. **Regression Analysis**: This method involves using regression for ideal nutritive entities, where a constant slope estimates true digestibility and a constant intercept estimates endogenous losses. Analytical methods can also be employed to remove endogenous losses from the measurements.\n\nThese methods provide a comprehensive approach to accurately assess true digestibility, which is crucial for understanding the nutritional value of feed and food proteins.
