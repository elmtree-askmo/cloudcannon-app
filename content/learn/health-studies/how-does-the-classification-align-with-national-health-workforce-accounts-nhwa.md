    How does the classification align with National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA)?
answer: >-
    The classification of health workers aligns closely with the National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) framework, which is designed to enhance the availability, quality, and use of health workforce data across countries. The NHWA comprises a set of 78 indicators that facilitate effective monitoring, management, and governance of the health workforce, ultimately supporting the achievement of universal health coverage and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe NHWA categorizes health workers into five broad groupings: \n\n1. Health professionals\n2. Health associate professionals\n3. Personal care workers in health services\n4. Health management and support personnel\n5. Other health service providers\n\nThis classification system is essential for mapping occupation categories and ensuring that data collected is comparable and useful for health workforce planning and policy-making. The NHWA Handbook provides detailed guidance on the classification of health workers, including the use of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes, which helps standardize data collection and reporting.\n\nFurthermore, the NHWA framework is modular, encompassing various components such as education, labor force, and population health needs, which correspond to the major types of policies required to deliver safe and effective health services. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the health workforce landscape, enabling countries to make informed decisions regarding health workforce management and development.\n\nIn summary, the alignment of health worker classification with the NHWA enhances the ability of countries to monitor and improve their health workforce data, thereby contributing to better health outcomes and more effective health systems globally.
