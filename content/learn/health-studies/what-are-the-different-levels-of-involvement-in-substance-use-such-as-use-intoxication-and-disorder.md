    What are the different levels of involvement in substance use, such as use, intoxication, and disorder?
answer: >-
    The different levels of involvement in substance use can be categorized into several stages, reflecting the complexity of substance use behaviors and their potential progression towards substance use disorders (SUDs). Here are the primary levels of involvement:\n\n1. **Non-Involvement (Non-Use)**: Individuals who have never used alcohol or other drugs.\n\n2. **Irregular Involvement**: This includes experimental use, where individuals may try a substance once or twice without regular consumption.\n\n3. **Regular Involvement**: At this stage, individuals use substances more frequently, often in social settings or as part of a routine.\n\n4. **Harmful Involvement**: This level indicates that substance use is beginning to cause negative consequences in the individual's life, such as health issues, relationship problems, or legal troubles.\n\n5. **Dependent Involvement**: This stage is characterized by a strong psychological or physical dependence on the substance, where individuals may feel unable to function without it. This is often where substance use disorders are diagnosed.\n\n6. **Transitional Abstinence**: Individuals may attempt to stop using substances but may still experience cravings or relapse.\n\n7. **Stabilized Abstinence/Recovery**: This is the stage where individuals have successfully maintained abstinence from substances for a significant period and are actively engaged in recovery efforts.\n\nThese levels illustrate a spectrum of substance use behaviors, from non-use to full-blown dependence, highlighting the gradual progression that can occur in individuals who engage with psychoactive substances. Understanding these levels is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for substance use disorders.
