    How does Texas provide women and children’s health services to undocumented immigrants?
answer: >-
    Texas provides health services to undocumented immigrants, particularly women and children, through various programs and initiatives aimed at improving access to healthcare despite the challenges posed by immigration status.\n\nOne significant program is the **Program for Immigrant and Refugee Child Health (PIRCH)** at Texas Children's Hospital, established in 2018. PIRCH focuses on enhancing healthcare for newly arrived immigrant and refugee children by eliminating barriers to care and promoting access to high-quality health services. The program collaborates with local, state, and national partners to support innovative initiatives that address the specific health needs of immigrant children, regardless of their country of origin.\n\nIn addition to PIRCH, Texas public hospitals are required to ask patients about their immigration status as part of an executive order implemented on November 1. However, it is important to note that while hospitals can inquire about immigration status, patients are not obligated to answer these questions, and such inquiries should not affect the quality of care provided. Advocacy groups, such as La Union del Pueblo Entero, have been active in informing communities about their rights under this policy, emphasizing that access to healthcare should remain a priority regardless of immigration status.\n\nDespite these efforts, access to Medicaid and other public health programs remains limited for undocumented immigrants. For instance, most undocumented adults are ineligible for Medicaid, which restricts access to healthcare services. However, children may have some access to programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if they meet certain criteria.\n\nOverall, while Texas has made strides in providing health services to undocumented immigrants, particularly through targeted programs like PIRCH, significant barriers still exist, particularly regarding eligibility for public health insurance programs. The ongoing efforts of advocacy groups and healthcare providers are crucial in navigating these challenges and ensuring that women and children receive the necessary health services.
