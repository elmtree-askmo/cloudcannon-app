    What is the role of prolactin (PRL) in the body?
answer: >-
    Prolactin (PRL), also known as lactotropin or mammotropin, is a protein hormone produced primarily by the lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. Its most well-known role is in the regulation of lactation, where it stimulates the production of milk in the mammary glands of females during and after pregnancy. Prolactin is secreted in response to various stimuli, including eating, mating, estrogen treatment, ovulation, and nursing, and it is released in pulses throughout the day.\n\nIn addition to its primary function in lactation, prolactin is involved in over 300 different processes in various vertebrates, including humans. These processes encompass a wide range of physiological functions, such as influencing the reproductive system, affecting behavior, and regulating the immune system. For instance, after ovulation, prolactin levels increase to prepare the body for a potential pregnancy, and it plays a role in breast development.\n\nProlactin's effects are not limited to females; it also has implications for males, although its specific functions in males are less understood. Elevated levels of prolactin, a condition known as hyperprolactinemia, can lead to various clinical issues. In females, high prolactin levels can cause amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) due to the inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. In males, hyperprolactinemia can result in symptoms such as headaches and decreased libido.\n\nOverall, prolactin is a multifaceted hormone with significant roles in reproductive health, lactation, and beyond, highlighting its importance in both physiological and clinical contexts.
