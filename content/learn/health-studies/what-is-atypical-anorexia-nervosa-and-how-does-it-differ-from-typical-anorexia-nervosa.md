    What is atypical anorexia nervosa and how does it differ from typical anorexia nervosa?
answer: >-
    Atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN) is an eating disorder that shares many characteristics with typical anorexia nervosa but differs primarily in terms of weight. Individuals with atypical anorexia meet all the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, including a significant disturbance in body image, a history of restrictive eating, and an intense fear of weight gain. However, the key distinction is that they are not currently underweight; instead, their weight remains within or above the medically defined healthy range, even after experiencing significant weight loss.\n\nThis condition was officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published in 2013, although cases fitting this description have been observed for many years prior. Research indicates that atypical anorexia may be equally or even more prevalent than typical anorexia nervosa, affecting approximately 0.2% to 4.9% of the population. \n\nDespite being labeled "atypical," the severity of atypical anorexia can be comparable to that of typical anorexia nervosa, challenging the stereotype that anorexia only affects individuals with very low body weight or BMI. The rising number of individuals seeking treatment for atypical anorexia highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing this condition, as it can lead to serious health consequences similar to those associated with typical anorexia nervosa.
