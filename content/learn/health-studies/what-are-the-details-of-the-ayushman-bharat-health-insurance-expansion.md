    What are the details of the Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance expansion?
answer: >-
    The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) has recently undergone a significant expansion to include health insurance coverage for all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of their income. This expansion was approved by the Union Cabinet on September 11, 2024, and aims to provide free health coverage of up to ₹5 lakh per family per year.\n\nKey details of the expansion include:\n\n1. **Eligibility**: All senior citizens aged 70 and above are eligible for the new coverage under AB PM-JAY. This includes individuals from all socio-economic backgrounds.\n\n2. **Existing Coverage Options**: Seniors who are already enrolled in other public health insurance schemes, such as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), or Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), have the option to either retain their current coverage or switch to the AB PM-JAY scheme.\n\n3. **Implementation Timeline**: Registration for the expanded insurance scheme is expected to begin shortly after the announcement, allowing eligible seniors to access the benefits quickly.\n\n4. **Impact**: This expansion is particularly significant as it addresses the healthcare needs of a growing elderly population in India. Currently, only about 20% of the population over the age of 60 is covered by any form of health insurance, highlighting the need for broader coverage.\n\n5. **Financial Outlay**: The expansion is expected to be implemented with an outlay of approximately ₹3,437 crore, reflecting the government's commitment to enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens.\n\nThis move is seen as a crucial step towards achieving universal health coverage in India, particularly for the elderly, who often face higher healthcare costs and greater health risks.
