    What are the main functions of the adrenal glands?
answer: >-
    The adrenal glands, also known as suprarenal glands, are small, triangular-shaped endocrine glands located atop each kidney. Despite their small size, they play a crucial role in regulating various essential functions in the body through hormone production. The main functions of the adrenal glands include:\n\n1. **Stress Response**: One of the primary functions of the adrenal glands is to respond to stress, whether physical (such as injury or extreme temperatures) or psychological (such as emotional distress). They release hormones that help the body manage stress effectively.\n\n2. **Hormone Production**: The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones that are vital for numerous bodily functions. These hormones can be categorized into two main groups:\n   - **Catecholamines**: Produced by the adrenal medulla, these include adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which help regulate blood pressure, heart rate, and other activities controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.\n   - **Steroid Hormones**: Produced by the adrenal cortex, these include:\n     - **Glucocorticoids** (e.g., cortisol), which are involved in metabolism regulation, immune response, and stress management.\n     - **Mineralocorticoids** (e.g., aldosterone), which help regulate blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\n     - **Adrenal androgens**, which play a role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive function.\n\n3. **Metabolism Regulation**: The hormones produced by the adrenal glands are essential for regulating metabolism, including blood sugar levels and energy production.\n\n4. **Blood Pressure Regulation**: Through the action of hormones like aldosterone and catecholamines, the adrenal glands help maintain blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n\n5. **Immune System Regulation**: The adrenal glands also influence the immune system, helping to modulate immune responses and inflammation.\n\n6. **Cardiovascular Function**: The hormones released by the adrenal glands support proper cardiovascular function, ensuring that the heart and blood vessels respond appropriately to various physiological demands.\n\nIn summary, the adrenal glands are integral to the body's ability to respond to stress, regulate metabolism, maintain blood pressure, and support overall health through their diverse hormone production.
