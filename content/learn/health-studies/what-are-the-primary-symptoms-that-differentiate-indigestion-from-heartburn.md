    What are the primary symptoms that differentiate indigestion from heartburn?
answer: >-
    Indigestion and heartburn are often confused due to overlapping symptoms, but they are distinct conditions with specific characteristics.\n\n**Indigestion**, also known as dyspepsia, is a collection of gastrointestinal symptoms that may include:\n- Burping\n- Bloating\n- Nausea\n- Stomach pain or discomfort\n- Feeling full quickly after starting to eat\n- A general upset stomach\n\nThese symptoms can occur after eating too much or consuming certain foods, drinks, or medications. Indigestion is often described as an upset stomach or stomachache.\n\n**Heartburn**, on the other hand, is characterized primarily by:\n- A burning sensation in the chest, often after eating\n- A sour or bitter taste in the mouth\n- Discomfort that may worsen when lying down or bending over\n\nHeartburn occurs when stomach acid travels up into the esophagus, leading to irritation and the characteristic burning sensation.\n\nIn summary, while heartburn is a specific symptom that can occur as part of indigestion, indigestion encompasses a broader range of symptoms, including those related to discomfort and bloating. Understanding these differences can help in identifying the appropriate treatment and management strategies for each condition.
