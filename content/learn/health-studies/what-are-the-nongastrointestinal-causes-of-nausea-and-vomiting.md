    What are the non-gastrointestinal causes of nausea and vomiting?
answer: >-
    Nausea and vomiting can arise from a variety of non-gastrointestinal causes, which may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or result from systemic conditions. Here are some notable non-gastrointestinal causes:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Issues**: Nausea and vomiting can be atypical symptoms of heart conditions, such as angina or heart attacks, particularly when the inferior part of the heart is affected.\n\n2. **Neurological Conditions**: Disorders affecting the CNS, such as brain tumors, infections (like meningitis), or vestibular disorders (e.g., Ménière’s disease and vestibular neuritis), can lead to nausea and vomiting.\n\n3. **Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders**: Conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or adrenal insufficiency can cause nausea and vomiting due to metabolic imbalances.\n\n4. **Medications and Toxins**: Various medications, including chemotherapy agents, opioids, and even common substances like alcohol, can induce nausea and vomiting. Additionally, exposure to toxins can also trigger these symptoms.\n\n5. **Psychiatric Conditions**: Anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders can manifest with physical symptoms, including nausea and vomiting.\n\n6. **Infections**: Systemic infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, can also lead to nausea and vomiting, even though they do not directly involve the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n7. **Pregnancy**: In some cases, pregnancy can lead to extreme nausea and vomiting, known as hyperemesis gravidarum, which is a severe form of morning sickness.\n\nUnderstanding these non-gastrointestinal causes is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of nausea and vomiting, as they can significantly influence diagnosis and treatment strategies.
