    Case management is defined as a collaborative process that involves several key activities: assessing, planning, implementing, coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating the options and services required to meet an individual's health and human service needs. This process aims to improve outcomes, experiences, and value for clients and stakeholders across various settings, including healthcare, social services, and education.\n\nAt its core, case management serves as a means to enhance clients' health and promote wellness and autonomy through advocacy, communication, education, and the identification of service resources. It is characterized by a professional and collaborative approach, ensuring that care is tailored to the unique needs of individuals and families.
