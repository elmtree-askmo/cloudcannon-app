    What roles do Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals play in the classification?
answer: >-
    Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals play a crucial role in the classification of health workers, particularly within the framework of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). Their responsibilities encompass identifying, investigating, and controlling harmful environmental exposures that can lead to illness and injury, which is essential for public health protection.\n\nIn the context of health workforce classification, these professionals are categorized under the ISCO-08 code 2263, which specifically pertains to Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals. This classification includes both practicing (active) professionals and all registered individuals in the health occupation, depending on the data source used for analysis.\n\nThe role of these professionals extends beyond traditional environmental health practices; they are integral to workplace health improvement initiatives. They contribute to the broader goals of sustainable development, particularly in relation to health and well-being, decent work, and responsible consumption and production, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nMoreover, the classification of these professionals is vital for health workforce data improvement, as it allows for better comparability of health worker data across different regions and countries. This, in turn, supports global health workforce management and the effective implementation of health worker classification systems.\n\nIn summary, Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals are essential to the health workforce classification system, providing critical insights and actions that protect public health and enhance workplace safety. Their inclusion in health workforce data is necessary for understanding workforce composition and addressing current and future challenges in public health.
