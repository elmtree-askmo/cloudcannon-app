    What are the main components of the human excretory system?
answer: >-
    The main components of the human excretory system, also known as the urinary system, include the following organs:\n\n1. **Kidneys**: There are two bean-shaped kidneys located on either side of the vertebral column in the back of the abdomen. They are the primary organs responsible for filtering blood, removing waste products, and regulating fluid balance.\n\n2. **Ureters**: These are two tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. Each kidney has its own ureter.\n\n3. **Urinary Bladder**: This is a muscular sac that stores urine until it is ready to be expelled from the body. It can expand to hold varying amounts of urine.\n\n4. **Urethra**: This is a tube that carries urine from the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. In males, the urethra also serves as a passage for semen.\n\nIn addition to these primary components, other organs such as the skin, liver, large intestine, and lungs also play roles in excretion by removing specific waste products from the body. For example, the skin excretes sweat, which contains salts and urea, while the lungs expel carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration.\n\nOverall, the human excretory system is essential for maintaining homeostasis by eliminating metabolic wastes and regulating the body's fluid and electrolyte balance.
