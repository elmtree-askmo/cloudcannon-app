    How does climate change affect marine life and ecosystems?
answer: >-
    Climate change significantly affects marine life and ecosystems through various mechanisms, leading to profound ecological and socio-economic consequences. Here are some key impacts:\n\n1. **Ocean Acidification**: As atmospheric CO2 levels rise, a substantial portion of this gas is absorbed by the oceans, leading to ocean acidification. This process decreases the pH of seawater, which can dissolve the calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms such as corals, scallops, lobsters, and certain plankton species. These organisms are crucial for the marine food web and provide essential habitats for other marine life.\n\n2. **Temperature Changes**: Rising ocean temperatures can disrupt marine ecosystems. Increased temperatures can lead to shifts in species distributions, as many marine species may migrate towards cooler waters. This can alter community structures and affect predator-prey relationships.\n\n3. **Extreme Marine Events**: Climate change is associated with more frequent and severe extreme marine events, such as heatwaves and storms. These events can cause significant damage to marine habitats, including coral reefs, which are particularly vulnerable. A warming of 1.5°C threatens to destroy 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs, while a 2°C increase could lead to nearly complete loss.\n\n4. **Changes in Nutrient Input and Oxygen Levels**: Climate change affects nutrient input and oxygen content in ocean waters. Altered nutrient dynamics can lead to harmful algal blooms, which can deplete oxygen levels and create dead zones, further threatening marine biodiversity.\n\n5. **Impacts on Biodiversity**: The combined effects of rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and changes in nutrient dynamics can lead to a decline in marine biodiversity. This loss of biodiversity can reduce the resilience of marine ecosystems, making them less able to recover from disturbances.\n\n6. **Socio-Economic Consequences**: The impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems also have significant implications for human communities. Approximately 680 million people live in low-lying coastal areas, and nearly half of the world's population relies on fish for protein. The livelihoods of around 60 million people working in fisheries and aquaculture are at risk due to the declining health of marine ecosystems.\n\nIn summary, climate change poses a multifaceted threat to marine life and ecosystems, affecting their structure, function, and the services they provide to humanity. The urgency of addressing these changes is underscored by the potential for irreversible damage to critical marine habitats and the communities that depend on them.
