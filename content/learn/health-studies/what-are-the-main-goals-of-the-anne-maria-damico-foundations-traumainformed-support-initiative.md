    What are the main goals of the Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation's Trauma-Informed Support initiative?
answer: >-
    The main goals of the Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation's Trauma-Informed Support initiative are centered around providing comprehensive and accessible services to women who have experienced violence, particularly those from marginalized groups. The initiative aims to:\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Ensure that trauma-informed support services are available to populations often denied service, such as women living with disabilities, trans women, and newcomer women. This inclusivity is crucial for addressing the unique challenges faced by these groups.\n\n2. **Safety and Trust**: Implement a framework based on the six guiding principles of trauma-informed care, which include safety, trustworthiness, transparency, peer support, collaboration, mutuality, empowerment, and choice. These principles help create an environment where individuals feel secure and supported.\n\n3. **Holistic Support**: Provide wrap-around services that address various needs of women experiencing violence, including mental health support, system navigation, and access to health services. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of different aspects of a survivor's life and aims to provide comprehensive care.\n\n4. **Reduction of Re-traumatization**: Focus on reducing the likelihood of re-traumatization by training staff to understand the impacts of trauma and how to interact sensitively with survivors. This includes adapting services to meet the specific needs of trauma survivors.\n\n5. **Empowerment**: Foster empowerment and choice among clients, allowing them to take an active role in their healing process and decision-making regarding their care and support.\n\nOverall, the Trauma-Informed Support initiative seeks to create a supportive and understanding environment that promotes healing and recovery for women affected by violence, while also addressing systemic barriers to care.
