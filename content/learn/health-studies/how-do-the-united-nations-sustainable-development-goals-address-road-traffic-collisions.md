    How do the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals address road traffic collisions?
answer: >-
    The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address road traffic collisions primarily through two specific targets: SDG 3, which focuses on good health and well-being, and SDG 11, which emphasizes sustainable cities and communities. \n\n1. **SDG 3 Target 3.6**: This target aims to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020. Road traffic injuries are a significant public health issue, with approximately 1.35 million fatalities and 50 million injuries occurring annually worldwide. The target highlights the urgent need for effective measures to improve road safety and reduce the burden of road traffic injuries, particularly among vulnerable populations such as young people.\n\n2. **SDG 11 Target 11.2**: This target seeks to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems, which includes improving road safety for all. It recognizes that sustainable urban transport is crucial for reducing road traffic collisions and enhancing overall public safety.\n\nIn addition to these targets, the United Nations has proclaimed the **Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030**, with the ambitious goal of reducing road deaths and serious injuries by 50% by the end of this period. This initiative builds on previous efforts and aims to mobilize global action to address the high rates of road traffic fatalities and injuries.\n\nThe inclusion of road safety in the SDGs marks a significant step in the global response to road traffic injuries, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies that involve various stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and international organizations. The Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety aims to align efforts and encourage changes that will lead to safer roads and reduced traffic-related casualties.\n\nOverall, the SDGs provide a framework for addressing road traffic collisions through targeted health and urban development initiatives, aiming to create safer environments for all road users.
