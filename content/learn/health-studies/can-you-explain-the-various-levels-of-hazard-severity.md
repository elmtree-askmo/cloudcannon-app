answer: >-
    The various levels of hazard severity can be categorized using risk matrices, which help assess the potential impact of hazards in a structured manner. Here are the key levels of hazard severity typically recognized in a 5x5 risk matrix:\n\n1. **Negligible**: Hazards classified under this level pose minimal or insignificant consequences. They may result in minor injuries or negligible damage, which are easily manageable.\n\n2. **Minor**: This level denotes hazards that can cause minor injuries, illnesses, or damage. The impact is generally limited and can often be addressed with standard safety measures.\n\n3. **Moderate**: Hazards at this level may commonly cause severe injury or illness. The consequences are more significant and may require immediate attention and intervention to mitigate risks.\n\n4. **Major**: This level indicates hazards that can lead to serious injuries, long-term health issues, or substantial damage. The potential consequences are severe enough to necessitate comprehensive safety protocols and emergency response plans.\n\n5. **Catastrophic**: Hazards classified as catastrophic can result in fatalities, irreversible health effects, or extensive damage to property and the environment. These hazards require the highest level of precaution and preparedness.\n\nIn addition to these levels, the severity ratings are often used in conjunction with likelihood assessments to determine overall risk. The combination of severity and likelihood helps organizations prioritize safety measures and allocate resources effectively to mitigate potential hazards.\n\nUnderstanding these levels of hazard severity is crucial for maintaining safety in both workplace and laboratory environments, as it informs the development of safety protocols, training, and emergency response procedures.
