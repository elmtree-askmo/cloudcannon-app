answer: >-
    The three main subatomic particles that make up an atom are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each of these particles plays a crucial role in determining the atomic number and mass of an atom.\n\n1. **Protons**: \n   - Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number of an element. For example, an atom with 6 protons is carbon, while an atom with 8 protons is oxygen. The atomic number is fundamental as it determines the identity of the element and its position in the periodic table.\n\n2. **Neutrons**: \n   - Neutrons are neutral particles, meaning they have no charge, and they also reside in the nucleus alongside protons. The number of neutrons can vary in atoms of the same element, leading to the formation of isotopes. The atomic mass of an atom is approximately equal to the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For instance, a carbon atom typically has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of about 12 atomic mass units (amu).\n\n3. **Electrons**: \n   - Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in energy levels. While they do contribute to the overall mass of an atom, their mass is negligible compared to that of protons and neutrons. The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, which balances the charge. However, if an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes an ion, which can affect its chemical behavior.\n\nIn summary, the atomic number is determined solely by the number of protons, while the atomic mass is the total count of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. This relationship is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of different elements in chemistry.
