    This content describes the key developmental changes during the three main stages of prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. Each stage features crucial milestones from zygote formation to sensory responsiveness in the fetus, highlighting the formation of organs and systems and the importance of a healthy prenatal environment.

answer: >-
    During prenatal development, the human organism undergoes significant changes across three main stages: the germinal stage, the embryonic stage, and the fetal stage. Each stage is characterized by distinct developmental milestones.\n\n### Germinal Stage (Conception to 2 Weeks)\n- **Zygote Formation:** The process begins with fertilization, where a sperm cell merges with an egg to form a zygote. This single cell contains all the genetic information necessary for the development of a new individual.\n- **Cell Division:** The zygote undergoes rapid cell division (mitosis) as it travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus.\n- **Blastocyst Formation:** By the end of this stage, the zygote develops into a blastocyst, which is a hollow ball of cells. The outer layer of the blastocyst will eventually form the placenta, while the inner cell mass will develop into the embryo.\n\n### Embryonic Stage (2 Weeks to 8 Weeks)\n- **Major Physical Structures:** This stage is critical for the development of major body systems and structures. The embryo begins to form essential organs, including the heart, brain, and spinal cord.\n- **Organogenesis:** The process of organ formation occurs, where cells differentiate into various types of tissues and organs. For example, the neural tube, which will develop into the brain and spinal cord, forms during this period.\n- **Vulnerability:** The embryo is particularly vulnerable to environmental influences, such as teratogens (substances that can cause developmental malformations), which can lead to congenital anomalies.\n\n### Fetal Stage (8 Weeks to Birth)\n- **Continued Development:** This stage marks the transition from an embryo to a fetus. The major organs and systems continue to develop and mature. \n- **Skeletal and Nervous System Development:** The skeletal system begins to ossify, and the nervous system undergoes significant growth, including the formation of neurons and synapses.\n- **Sensory Responsiveness:** By the end of this stage, the fetus exhibits sensory responsiveness, such as reacting to sounds and light. The development of the brain continues, with increased complexity and connectivity.\n- **Preparation for Birth:** The fetus grows in size and weight, preparing for birth. By the end of this stage, the fetus is typically around 20 inches long and weighs about 7-8 pounds.\n\nIn summary, the germinal stage focuses on the initial formation and implantation of the zygote, the embryonic stage is crucial for the development of major organs and systems, and the fetal stage involves the maturation and growth of these systems in preparation for birth. Each stage is vital for ensuring healthy development and minimizing risks associated with prenatal exposure to harmful substances.
