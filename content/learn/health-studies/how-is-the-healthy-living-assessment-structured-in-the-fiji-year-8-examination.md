    How is the Healthy Living Assessment structured in the Fiji Year 8 Examination?
answer: >-
    The Healthy Living Assessment in the Fiji Year 8 Examination is structured to evaluate students' understanding of various health-related topics. The assessment typically consists of two main sections:\n\n1. **Multiple-Choice Questions (Section A)**: This section includes a series of multiple-choice questions that cover a range of topics relevant to healthy living. For instance, the 2022 examination featured 12 multiple-choice questions addressing themes such as gender roles, peer pressure, respiration, adolescent changes, relationships, group behaviors, and mental health. Students are required to select the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n2. **Structured Questions (Section B)**: Following the multiple-choice section, students are often presented with structured questions that require more detailed responses. These questions may involve scenarios or case studies related to health education, prompting students to apply their knowledge critically.\n\nThe total time allocated for the Healthy Living Assessment is 1Â½ hours, with an additional 10 minutes allowed for reading the paper. Students must write their answers in the provided answer booklet, adhering to specific instructions regarding the use of ink.\n\nThis assessment structure is designed to not only test students' knowledge but also to encourage critical thinking and application of health education principles, which are essential for promoting healthy lifestyles among adolescents.
