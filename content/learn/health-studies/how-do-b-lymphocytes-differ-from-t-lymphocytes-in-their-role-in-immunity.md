    How do B lymphocytes differ from T lymphocytes in their role in immunity?
answer: >-
    B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells) are both crucial components of the adaptive immune system, but they have distinct roles and characteristics.\n\n### Key Differences Between B Lymphocytes and T Lymphocytes:\n\n1. **Site of Maturation**:\n   - **B Lymphocytes**: B cells originate and mature in the bone marrow.\n   - **T Lymphocytes**: T cells also originate in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus.\n\n2. **Function**:\n   - **B Lymphocytes**: B cells are primarily responsible for the humoral immune response. They produce antibodies, which are proteins that specifically recognize and neutralize foreign substances (antigens) such as bacteria and viruses. When activated, B cells can differentiate into plasma cells (or plasmocytes) that secrete large quantities of antibodies.\n   - **T Lymphocytes**: T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity. They do not produce antibodies but instead perform various functions, including directly killing infected or cancerous cells (cytotoxic T cells) and helping to coordinate the immune response (helper T cells). Helper T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies and assist in the activation of other immune cells.\n\n3. **Location in the Body**:\n   - **B Lymphocytes**: Mature B cells are primarily found in the peripheral blood and lymphatic system, often outside the lymph nodes.\n   - **T Lymphocytes**: Mature T cells are predominantly located within the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues.\n\n4. **Response to Antigens**:\n   - **B Lymphocytes**: B cells respond to free-floating antigens in body fluids. Upon encountering an antigen, they can undergo clonal expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.\n   - **T Lymphocytes**: T cells recognize antigens that are presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in conjunction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation.\n\n### Similarities:\n- Both B and T lymphocytes are types of white blood cells (lymphocytes) and are integral to the adaptive immune response.\n- They both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and are involved in recognizing and responding to specific antigens.\n- Both types of cells are non-phagocytic and play essential roles in protecting the body against infections and diseases.\n\nIn summary, while B lymphocytes are primarily responsible for producing antibodies and mediating the humoral immune response, T lymphocytes are involved in cell-mediated immunity and play a critical role in coordinating the overall immune response.
