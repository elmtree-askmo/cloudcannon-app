    What are the normal ranges for oral, rectal, and axillary temperature measurements?
answer: >-
    The normal temperature ranges for different measurement methods are as follows:\n\n1. **Oral Temperature**: The normal range is typically between 36.1°C to 37.2°C (97°F to 99°F). This method is commonly used but should not be performed immediately after eating or drinking, as it can affect the accuracy of the reading.\n\n2. **Rectal Temperature**: This method usually yields a slightly higher reading, with a normal range of approximately 37.1°C to 38.1°C (98.8°F to 100.6°F). Rectal temperatures are often considered the most accurate for core body temperature, especially in infants and young children.\n\n3. **Axillary Temperature**: The normal range for axillary measurements is generally lower, around 35.5°C to 37.0°C (95.9°F to 98.6°F). This method is less accurate than oral or rectal measurements and is often used for quick assessments.\n\nIt's important to note that variations in normal temperature can occur based on factors such as the time of day, the individual's activity level, and the specific method of measurement used.
