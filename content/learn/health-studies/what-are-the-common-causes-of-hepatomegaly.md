    What are the common causes of hepatomegaly?
answer: >-
    Hepatomegaly, or enlargement of the liver, can arise from a variety of causes, which can be broadly categorized into several groups:\n\n1. **Liver Diseases**: Common liver-related conditions that can lead to hepatomegaly include:\n   - **Hepatitis**: Inflammation of the liver, often due to viral infections.\n   - **Fatty Liver Disease**: This includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where fat accumulates in liver cells.\n   - **Cirrhosis**: Scarring of the liver tissue due to chronic liver damage.\n   - **Liver Cancer**: Tumors in the liver can cause enlargement.\n\n2. **Metabolic Disorders**: Conditions that affect the metabolism can lead to liver enlargement, such as:\n   - **Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)**: Previously known as NAFLD, this condition involves fat accumulation in the liver not caused by alcohol or other common factors.\n\n3. **Congestive Heart Failure**: This condition can lead to blood backing up in the liver, causing it to enlarge.\n\n4. **Infections**: Various infections, including viral hepatitis and liver abscesses, can result in hepatomegaly.\n\n5. **Toxic and Inflammatory Conditions**: Certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, statins) and autoimmune diseases can also lead to liver enlargement.\n\n6. **Neoplastic Conditions**: Besides primary liver cancers, metastatic cancers from other organs can also cause hepatomegaly.\n\n7. **Other Causes**: Less common causes include lymphoma and certain genetic disorders.\n\nHepatomegaly is a non-specific sign and often requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. Symptoms may include abdominal discomfort or jaundice, depending on the etiology.
