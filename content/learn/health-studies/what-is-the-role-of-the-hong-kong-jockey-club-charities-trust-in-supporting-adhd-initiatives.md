    What is the role of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust in supporting ADHD initiatives?
answer: >-
    The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust plays a significant role in supporting initiatives for individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through various funded projects. One of the key initiatives is the "Jockey Club Keen and Active Kids Project" (JCKAK), which has been operational since 2019. This project is specifically designed to provide systematic support for students with ADHD in mainstream primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe JCKAK project is notable for its comprehensive approach, which includes:\n\n1. **Targeted Support**: The program offers a minimum of 25 hours of service to groups of four to six students suspected of having ADHD, along with their parents and teachers. This ensures that all stakeholders are involved in the support process.\n\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques**: The project incorporates evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help students develop essential skills, such as self-awareness and executive functioning.\n\n3. **Collaborative Efforts**: The initiative is a collaboration between the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and various organizations, including the University of Hong Kong, Caritas Hong Kong, and other professional institutions. This multi-faceted approach enhances the effectiveness of the support provided.\n\n4. **Inclusive Education Framework**: The JCKAK promotes an inclusive education model through a "whole school participation" approach, utilizing a three-tiered support framework to cater to the diverse needs of students with ADHD.\n\n5. **Research and Evaluation**: The project also emphasizes the importance of research, collecting data on the effectiveness of the training methods used, which contributes to the broader understanding of ADHD and its management.\n\nOverall, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust's commitment to funding and supporting ADHD initiatives like the JCKAK reflects its dedication to improving the lives of affected students and fostering a more inclusive educational environment in Hong Kong.
