    What are the historical trends in global hunger rates?
answer: >-
    Historical trends in global hunger rates have shown significant fluctuations over the years, influenced by various factors including economic conditions, conflicts, and global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n1. **Long-term Trends**: The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a key tool used to measure and track hunger globally. Over the past two decades, there have been notable improvements in some regions, particularly in Asia and Latin America. However, the overall progress has stagnated in recent years, with the GHI score for the world showing only a slight decline from 19.1 in 2014 to 18.2 in 2022.\n\n2. **Recent Increases in Hunger**: From 2019 to 2021, global hunger rates rose sharply, with the percentage of undernourished individuals increasing from 8.20% in 2019 to 9.20% in 2021. This trend has persisted into 2023, with approximately 733 million people facing hunger, equivalent to one in eleven people globally. This represents an increase of about 152 million people since 2019.\n\n3. **Regional Disparities**: Hunger rates are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one in five people is affected. In contrast, North America and Europe report rates below 2.5%. While some subregions of Asia have made progress in reducing hunger, areas such as Western Asia, the Caribbean, and most subregions of Africa continue to see rising hunger levels.\n\n4. **Impact of Global Events**: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in food systems, leading to increased food insecurity and malnutrition. The pandemic highlighted the fragilities in global food systems and the inequalities that persist, driving further increases in hunger.\n\n5. **Current Situation**: As of 2023, the GHI indicates that hunger levels are serious in 36 countries, with alarming levels in six countries, including Burundi, Chad, and Yemen. The global food crisis has prompted international responses, including initiatives to improve food security and nutrition.\n\nIn summary, while there have been periods of progress in reducing global hunger, recent years have seen a troubling rise in hunger rates, particularly influenced by global crises and regional disparities. The challenge remains significant as the world aims to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to ending hunger and ensuring food security for all by 2030.
