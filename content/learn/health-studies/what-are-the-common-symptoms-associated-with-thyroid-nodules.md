    What are the common symptoms associated with thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    Thyroid nodules are common, and while most do not cause symptoms, there are certain situations where symptoms may arise. Here are the common symptoms associated with thyroid nodules:\n\n1. **Hyperthyroidism Symptoms**: In some cases, thyroid nodules can produce excess thyroxine, leading to symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These symptoms may include:\n   - Unexplained weight loss\n   - Increased sweating\n   - Tremors\n   - Nervousness or anxiety\n   - Rapid or irregular heartbeat\n\n2. **Physical Symptoms**: Although most thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, larger nodules can cause physical symptoms, such as:\n   - Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n   - Hoarseness or changes in voice\n   - A noticeable lump or swelling in the neck\n   - Pain in the neck or throat, particularly if there is sudden hemorrhage or infarction in cystic nodules\n\n3. **Incidental Findings**: Many thyroid nodules are discovered incidentally during routine physical examinations or imaging tests, such as ultrasounds or CT scans, performed for unrelated reasons.\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of thyroid nodules are benign and do not lead to significant health issues. However, if a nodule is large, hard, or causing discomfort, it may warrant further investigation to rule out malignancy.
