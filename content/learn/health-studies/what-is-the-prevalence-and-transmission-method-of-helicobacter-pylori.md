    What is the prevalence and transmission method of Helicobacter pylori?
answer: >-
    Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common bacterial infections globally, affecting approximately 50% of the world's population. The prevalence of H. pylori infection varies significantly based on geographic location, age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. For instance, higher prevalence rates are observed in developing countries, where conditions such as poor sanitation and crowded living environments contribute to the spread of the bacterium.\n\nTransmission of H. pylori primarily occurs through person-to-person contact, particularly via saliva. It can also be spread through fecal contamination of food or water. The bacteria are most commonly transmitted during childhood, with parents and siblings playing a significant role in the transmission dynamics. In areas with inadequate sanitation, the risk of infection increases due to factors like untreated water and poor hygiene practices.\n\nRecent studies indicate a declining trend in H. pylori prevalence globally, particularly between 2011 and 2022, with the most significant reductions noted in high-income countries and regions with better health coverage. However, the infection remains a major public health concern, especially in regions with high prevalence rates, such as Africa, where the pooled prevalence has been reported at around 70.1%.\n\nIn summary, H. pylori is a highly prevalent bacterium with significant transmission through direct contact and contaminated resources, and its prevalence is influenced by various socio-economic and environmental factors.
