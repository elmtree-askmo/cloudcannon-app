    What training and qualifications are required for case managers?
answer: >-
    To become a case manager, individuals typically need to meet specific training and qualification requirements, which can vary based on the certification they pursue and the sector in which they work. Here are the key qualifications and training pathways for aspiring case managers:\n\n1. **Educational Background**: Most case managers are required to have a relevant degree in fields such as nursing, social work, psychology, or other health and human services. This foundational education is crucial for understanding the complexities of case management.\n\n2. **Licensure**: Many case management certifications require candidates to hold an active license in a health or human services field. For example, registered nurses must have their nursing license to qualify for certain case management certifications.\n\n3. **Professional Experience**: Candidates typically need to demonstrate a minimum amount of supervised field experience. For instance, to qualify for the Commission for Case Manager Certification (CCMC) exam, candidates often need at least 12 months of health system case management experience supervised by a board-certified case manager within the last five years.\n\n4. **Continuing Education**: Ongoing professional development is essential. Many certifications require completion of continuing education hours. For example, candidates may need to complete 30 hours of continuing education in case management and related topics within the last two years, with a portion of those hours being specific to the certification they are pursuing.\n\n5. **Certification Options**: There are several certification options available for case managers, each with unique requirements. The most recognized certification is the Certified Case Manager (CCM) credential offered by the CCMC. Other certifications include the Nursing Case Management Certification (CMGT-BCâ„¢) from the ANCC, which is specifically for registered nurses.\n\n6. **Examination**: After meeting the educational and experience requirements, candidates must pass a certification examination to obtain their credential. This exam assesses their knowledge and skills in case management.\n\n7. **Employer Preferences**: It is worth noting that a significant percentage of employers (approximately 74%) prefer or require certification for case managers, highlighting the importance of obtaining these credentials for career advancement.\n\nIn summary, becoming a case manager involves a combination of relevant education, licensure, professional experience, continuing education, and certification. These requirements ensure that case managers are well-equipped to navigate complex healthcare systems and provide effective patient-centered care.
