    What are the recommended vaccination protocols for Hepatitis B?
answer: >-
    The recommended vaccination protocols for Hepatitis B (HepB) have been updated to enhance public health measures against the virus. Here are the key points regarding the vaccination schedule:\n\n1. **Universal Vaccination for Adults**: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) now recommends universal HepB vaccination for all adults aged 19 to 59 years. This approach eliminates the need for risk factor screening, which can increase vaccination coverage and reduce the incidence of hepatitis B cases.\n\n2. **Infant Vaccination**: For infants, the HepB vaccine should be administered within 24 hours of birth for medically stable infants weighing â‰¥2,000 grams born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative mothers. The first dose is typically given at 6 weeks of age, but the birth dose is crucial for early protection.\n\n3. **Vaccination Schedule**: The HepB vaccine is usually given in a series of doses. The standard vaccination schedule for adults typically includes:\n   - **3 doses** at 0, 1, and 6 months, or\n   - **4 doses** at 0, 7, 21-30 days, with a booster dose at 12 months.\n\n4. **Alternative Dosing Schedules**: For individuals with known or presumed exposure to Hepatitis B, the Engerix-B vaccine can be administered on a schedule of 0, 1, and 6 months, or 0, 1, 2, and 12 months.\n\n5. **Combination Vaccines**: The Twinrix vaccine, which combines Hepatitis A and B vaccines, can also be used. Each dose of Twinrix contains an adult dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, and a HepB series started with Twinrix can be completed with a single antigen vaccine.\n\nThese vaccination protocols are critical in preventing Hepatitis B infection and its associated complications, and they reflect a significant public health initiative to control the spread of the virus.
