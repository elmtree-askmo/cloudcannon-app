    How is the hierarchical structure of occupational titles and codes organized in the classification of health workers?
answer: >-
    The hierarchical structure of occupational titles and codes in the classification of health workers is primarily organized according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO, 2008 revision). This classification system employs a hierarchical framework that categorizes health workers based on their skill levels and areas of specialization. \n\nThe classification reflects the distinctions among subgroups of the health workforce, which are determined by the differences in the skills and specializations required to perform various tasks and duties associated with different health occupations. This hierarchical mapping facilitates the organization of health worker data, allowing for better analysis and comparison across different regions and health systems.\n\nIn essence, the ISCO provides a structured approach to classifying health workers, enabling the aggregation of occupational information from various sources, including population censuses, surveys, and administrative records. This systematic classification is crucial for global health workforce management, as it aids in understanding workforce distribution, training needs, and the overall capacity of health systems to meet public health demands.
