answer: >-
    The 1985 Non-Smokers' Health Act was a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating smoking in federal workplaces and certain modes of transportation in Canada. This Act was part of a broader movement to address public health concerns related to smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nThe Act specifically addressed smoking prohibition in federal buildings and workplaces by establishing regulations that restricted smoking in these environments. It mandated that employers designate specific areas for smoking, if any, and aimed to minimize the exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke. The legislation recognized the health risks associated with smoking and sought to create a healthier work environment for federal employees.\n\nKey provisions of the Non-Smokers' Health Act included:\n\n1. **Designation of Smoking Areas**: Employers were allowed to designate specific rooms or areas for smoking, but these areas had to be separate from non-smoking areas to protect non-smokers from exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\n2. **Regulation of Smoking in Transportation**: The Act also extended its provisions to certain modes of transportation, ensuring that passengers and employees in federal transportation services were protected from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke.\n\n3. **Public Health Promotion**: The Act was part of a larger public health initiative to promote awareness about the dangers of smoking and to encourage healthier lifestyles among Canadians.\n\nOverall, the 1985 Non-Smokers' Health Act laid the groundwork for subsequent smoking regulations and policies in Canada, contributing to the ongoing efforts to reduce smoking prevalence and protect public health.
