    What is the prevalence of liver cancer in Hong Kong?
answer: >-
    In Hong Kong, liver cancer is a significant health concern, being the fifth most common cancer. In 2021, there were 1,771 new cases of liver cancer, which accounted for 4.6% of all new cancer cases diagnosed that year. The crude annual incidence rate was 24 cases per 100,000 population. \n\nLiver cancer is particularly prevalent among men, where it ranks as the fourth most common cancer, while it is the twelfth most common cancer in women. Additionally, liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in Hong Kong, with 1,447 deaths attributed to it in 2021, representing 9.6% of all cancer-related deaths.\n\nTrends indicate that while the age-standardized incidence rate of liver cancer has been declining, the absolute number of new cases has been increasing, especially among males, likely due to factors such as population aging and growth. The highest incidence rates are observed in individuals aged 75 and older, with a rate of 152.4 per 100,000 persons in that age group. \n\nOverall, liver cancer remains a critical public health issue in Hong Kong, necessitating ongoing monitoring and research to address its rising incidence and associated mortality.
