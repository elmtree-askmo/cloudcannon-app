    How has the Ministry responded to the suspected Mpox case and what is the risk assessment?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the Ministry of Health in Kenya has responded to the suspected Mpox cases by implementing a series of preparedness and response measures aimed at swiftly detecting and halting the spread of the disease. Following the confirmation of Mpox in the country on July 31, 2024, health authorities have been proactive in collecting samples for laboratory testing from suspected cases. As of mid-July 2024, two cases tested positive for the MPXV Clade Ib variant, which is considered more severe.\n\nThe Ministry has reassured the public that there are currently no active cases of Mpox in Kenya, following the recovery of the index case identified on July 29, 2024. The health authorities are working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to enhance diagnostic capacity and outbreak control efforts. This collaboration includes deploying experts to affected regions and integrating disease surveillance and outbreak response efforts.\n\nIn terms of risk assessment, the WHO has conducted a global rapid risk assessment, which indicates that the risk factors for Mpox can vary based on individual behavior, geographic location, and immune status. The assessment has been revised to differentiate between the risks associated with different clades of the Mpox virus, particularly Clade I and Clade II, to better inform public health responses.\n\nOverall, the Ministry's response reflects a commitment to public health safety and the containment of Mpox, while ongoing assessments aim to adapt strategies to the evolving situation.
