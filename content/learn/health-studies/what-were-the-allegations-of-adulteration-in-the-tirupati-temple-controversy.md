    What were the allegations of adulteration in the Tirupati Temple controversy?
answer: >-
    The Tirupati Temple controversy primarily revolves around allegations of adulteration in the preparation of the famous laddu prasadam. The allegations suggest that the ghee used in making these laddus was adulterated with animal fat. This controversy gained significant attention when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu claimed that laboratory tests had confirmed the presence of both animal and vegetable fat in the laddus distributed to devotees.\n\nIn response to these allegations, the Supreme Court of India ordered a fresh investigation, leading to the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) that includes officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Andhra Pradesh Police, and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The SIT's mandate is to investigate the claims of adulterated ghee used during the previous YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) regime.\n\nThe controversy has not only raised concerns about food safety and religious practices but has also sparked political tensions, with accusations exchanged between political parties regarding the integrity of the temple's offerings. The Supreme Court emphasized that the investigation should not be politicized and is intended to address the concerns of millions of devotees worldwide.
