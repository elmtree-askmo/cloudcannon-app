    How is a full term pregnancy classified by ACOG?
answer: >-
    The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) classifies full-term pregnancy as lasting from 39 weeks, 0 days to 40 weeks, 6 days of gestation. This classification is part of a broader categorization that includes:\n\n- **Early term**: 37 weeks, 0 days to 38 weeks, 6 days\n- **Full term**: 39 weeks, 0 days to 40 weeks, 6 days\n- **Late term**: 41 weeks, 0 days to 41 weeks, 6 days\n- **Post term**: More than 42 weeks\n\nThis new classification system was developed to provide more specific designations for term pregnancies, as the risk of perinatal complications varies throughout the term period. ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) encourage the use of these definitions to improve data reporting and the quality of healthcare provided to pregnant individuals. Full-term pregnancies are associated with the best health outcomes for infants, as their organs are typically fully developed by this stage.
