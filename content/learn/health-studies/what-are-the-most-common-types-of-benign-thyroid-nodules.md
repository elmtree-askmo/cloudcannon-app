    What are the most common types of benign thyroid nodules?
answer: >-
    The most common types of benign thyroid nodules include:\n\n1. **Colloid Nodules**: These are benign growths that consist of a buildup of thyroid cells and colloid, a gel-like substance produced by the thyroid gland. They are typically noncancerous and are the most prevalent type of thyroid nodule.\n\n2. **Cystic Nodules**: These nodules are fluid-filled sacs within the thyroid gland. They can be simple cysts, which are usually benign, or complex cysts that may require further evaluation to rule out malignancy.\n\n3. **Spongiform Nodules**: These nodules have a characteristic appearance on ultrasound, resembling a sponge due to their internal structure. They are generally considered to pose a low risk for malignancy.\n\n4. **Hyperplastic Nodules**: These are benign enlargements of thyroid tissue that occur due to increased cell proliferation. They are often associated with multinodular goiter.\n\n5. **Adenomatous Nodules**: These are benign tumors of the thyroid gland that can sometimes produce thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism. They are usually well-defined and encapsulated.\n\nMost thyroid nodules are benign, with studies indicating that about 90% of nodules fall into this category. While benign nodules often do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms, they may be monitored through active surveillance or watchful waiting to ensure they do not change in size or characteristics over time.
