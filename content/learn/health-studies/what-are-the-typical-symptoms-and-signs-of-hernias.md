    What are the typical symptoms and signs of hernias?
answer: >-
    The typical symptoms and signs of hernias can vary depending on the type and location of the hernia. Here are some common indicators:\n\n1. **Visible Swelling or Bulge**: One of the most noticeable signs of a hernia is a visible lump or bulge in the affected area, which may appear during activities such as coughing, straining, or lifting. This bulge can often be pushed back in (reducible) or may remain protruded (incarcerated).\n\n2. **Heavy Feeling**: Many individuals report a heavy or dragging sensation in the abdomen or groin, which can sometimes be accompanied by discomfort.\n\n3. **Pain or Discomfort**: While some hernias may be asymptomatic, others can cause pain, especially when engaging in physical activities. The pain may be sharp or aching and can worsen with movement.\n\n4. **Symptoms in Children**: Inguinal hernias in newborns and children may only be visible when the child is crying, coughing, or straining. Symptoms can include fussiness, abdominal pain, and swelling in the lower abdomen.\n\n5. **Complications**: If a hernia becomes incarcerated or strangulated, it can lead to severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and signs of bowel obstruction. This condition requires immediate medical attention.\n\n6. **Other Symptoms**: In some cases, hernias may be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation or blood in the stool, particularly if the hernia affects the intestines.\n\nOverall, while many hernias may not cause significant symptoms, the presence of a bulge, discomfort, or pain should prompt a consultation with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and management.
