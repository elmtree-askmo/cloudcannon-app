answer: >-
    The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is a significant initiative launched by the Indian government on February 15, 2024, aimed at promoting the adoption of solar energy among households. The key objectives of the scheme include:\n\n1. **Rooftop Solar Installation**: The primary goal is to achieve the installation of 1 crore rooftop solar systems (RTS) in the residential sector. This initiative is designed to empower households to generate their own electricity through solar power.\n\n2. **Free Electricity Provision**: The scheme aims to provide free electricity to 1 crore households, allowing them to receive up to 300 units of electricity per month at no cost. This is intended to alleviate the financial burden of electricity costs on low-income families.\n\n3. **Skill Development**: The initiative also focuses on creating more than 3 lakh skilled manpower through fresh skilling and up-skilling programs related to solar energy installation and maintenance.\n\n4. **Financial Subsidies**: The government will provide substantial financial subsidies, covering up to 40% of the installation costs for rooftop solar systems, making it more accessible for households to adopt solar energy.\n\n5. **Sustainable Energy Transition**: The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is part of a broader strategy to enhance the share of renewable energy in India's energy mix, contributing to the country's sustainability goals and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nOverall, the scheme is expected to significantly impact the energy landscape in India by promoting renewable energy usage, reducing electricity costs for households, and fostering economic empowerment through skill development.
