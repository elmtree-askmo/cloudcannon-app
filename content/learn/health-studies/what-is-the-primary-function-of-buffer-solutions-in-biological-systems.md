    What is the primary function of buffer solutions in biological systems?
answer: >-
    The primary function of buffer solutions in biological systems is to maintain a stable pH despite the addition of small amounts of acids or bases. This is crucial because many biochemical processes are highly sensitive to changes in pH, and even slight deviations can disrupt cellular functions and metabolic pathways.\n\nBuffers typically consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. They work by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions (H⁺) or hydroxide ions (OH⁻) that may be introduced into the system. For example, the bicarbonate buffer system in the blood plays a vital role in regulating pH, helping to keep it around 7.4, which is essential for proper physiological function. When excess acids are present, bicarbonate ions can react with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid, thereby reducing acidity. Conversely, if the pH rises and becomes too basic, carbonic acid can dissociate to release hydrogen ions, thus lowering the pH.\n\nIn summary, buffer solutions are essential for maintaining homeostasis in biological systems by stabilizing pH levels, which is critical for the proper functioning of enzymes and other biochemical processes.
