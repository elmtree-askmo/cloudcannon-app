    During the Irish immigration period, particularly in the mid-19th century, the key public health responses to the typhus outbreaks were shaped by the context of mass immigration due to the Great Famine in Ireland. Here are the main responses observed:\n\n1. **Establishment of Fever Sheds**: In cities like Montreal and Toronto, fever sheds were quickly constructed to isolate and treat the influx of Irish immigrants suffering from typhus. These makeshift hospitals were essential in managing the outbreak, although they were often overcrowded and poorly equipped. In Montreal, for instance, between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in these sheds, highlighting the severity of the situation.\n\n2. **Local Authority Responses**: Local authorities in urban Britain and Canada faced significant challenges in managing the health crisis. Poor law guardians struggled to find additional hospital beds, medical staff, and resources to cope with the rising number of typhus cases. The fear of the disease, often referred to as "Irish fever," led to heightened public health measures, including the mobilization of troops to control the movement of immigrants and prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n3. **Public Health Legislation**: The outbreaks prompted discussions around public health legislation and the need for improved health infrastructure. The high mortality rates and the association of typhus with Irish immigrants fueled long-lasting resentments and debates about public health funding and the treatment of immigrants.\n\n4. **Community and Social Responses**: The epidemic also led to community-level responses, where local organizations and charities attempted to provide care and support for the afflicted. However, these efforts were often hampered by the stigma associated with the disease and the immigrants themselves.\n\n5. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: As the epidemic progressed, there was a growing awareness of the need for better sanitation and living conditions to prevent the spread of typhus. This included calls for improved housing and hygiene practices among the immigrant population.\n\nOverall, the public health responses to typhus during the Irish immigration period were characterized by a combination of emergency measures, community efforts, and the beginnings of a more structured approach to public health that would evolve in the following decades. The legacy of these responses influenced future public health policies and practices in Canada and beyond.
