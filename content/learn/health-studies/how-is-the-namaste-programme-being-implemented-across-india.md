    How is the NAMASTE Programme being implemented across India?
answer: >-
    The NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem) Programme is being implemented across India with a focus on ensuring the safety and dignity of sanitation workers. Launched in 2022, this initiative is a joint effort by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The programme aims to eradicate unsafe practices in sewer and septic tank cleaning, thereby promoting the welfare of sanitation workers.\n\n### Key Aspects of Implementation:\n\n1. **Budget and Duration**: The NAMASTE scheme is set to be implemented over three years, from FY 2023-24 to FY 2025-26, with a budget allocation of ₹349.73 crores. The Union Budget for 2023-2024 has specifically allocated nearly ₹100 crores to facilitate the mechanical desludging of septic tanks and sewers across all cities and towns.\n\n2. **Three-Tiered Structure**: The implementation of the NAMASTE scheme follows a three-tiered monitoring structure:\n   - **National NAMASTE Management Unit (NNMU)**: This unit will oversee the scheme's implementation through a robust IT-enabled system, support City NAMASTE Management Units, and provide reports to the management.\n   - **State NAMASTE Nodal Officers**: Each state is required to nominate a Nodal Officer from the Urban Development Department to coordinate the implementation at the state level.\n   - **Local Bodies**: The scheme will be executed at the local body level, ensuring that the needs and conditions of sanitation workers are addressed effectively.\n\n3. **Goals and Objectives**: The primary goal of the NAMASTE scheme is to achieve zero fatalities in sanitation work. It aims to create an enabling ecosystem that recognizes sanitation workers as essential contributors to sanitation infrastructure. This includes providing sustainable livelihoods, enhancing occupational safety, and improving access to safety gear through capacity building.\n\n4. **Profiling and Data Collection**: As part of the initial phase, approximately 38,000 sanitation workers have been profiled from over 3,000 urban local bodies across 29 states and union territories. This data collection is crucial for understanding the demographics and risks faced by sewer and septic tank workers.\n\n5. **Convergence of Efforts**: The NAMASTE scheme emphasizes the convergence of programs between MoSJE and MoHUA, highlighting the joint responsibility for the safety of sanitation workers. This collaborative approach aims to strengthen governance and implementation of the scheme's components.\n\n6. **Community Focus**: The programme particularly addresses the caste-based occupational hazards faced by sanitation workers, with a significant percentage belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), or Other Backward Class (OBC) communities.\n\nIn summary, the NAMASTE Programme is a comprehensive initiative aimed at transforming the sanitation sector in India by mechanizing sanitation processes, ensuring worker safety, and promoting social justice for marginalized communities involved in sanitation work.
