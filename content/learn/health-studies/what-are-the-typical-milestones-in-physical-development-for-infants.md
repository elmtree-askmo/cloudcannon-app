    What are the typical milestones in physical development for infants?
answer: >-
    Infants typically reach several key physical development milestones during their first year of life. These milestones can vary slightly from child to child, but they generally follow a predictable pattern. Here are some of the typical milestones categorized by age:\n\n### 1 Month\n- **Lifts head**: When lying on their stomach, infants can lift their head briefly.\n- **Smiles**: Social smiles may begin to emerge.\n\n### 2 Months\n- **Holds head up**: Infants can hold their head up when on their tummy.\n- **Kicks arms and legs**: They kick both arms and legs while lying on their back.\n\n### 4 Months\n- **Rolls over**: Many infants can roll from front to back.\n- **Grasps objects**: They can grasp a rattle or other toys placed in their hands.\n- **Laughs**: Infants may begin to laugh and show more social engagement.\n\n### 6 Months\n- **Sits with support**: Infants can sit with little or no support.\n- **Reaches for toys**: They can reach for and grasp toys, showing increased hand-eye coordination.\n\n### 7 Months\n- **Rolls both ways**: Infants can roll over in both directions.\n- **Sits without support**: They can sit independently for longer periods.\n\n### 9 Months\n- **Crawls**: Many infants begin to crawl, moving around on their hands and knees.\n- **Pulls to stand**: They may pull themselves up to a standing position using furniture for support.\n\n### 12 Months\n- **Stands alone**: Infants can stand independently for a few moments.\n- **Takes first steps**: Many infants take their first steps, marking the beginning of walking.\n\nThese milestones are important indicators of physical development and are often used by healthcare providers to assess an infant's growth and development. It's essential to remember that while most infants reach these milestones within a similar timeframe, individual development can vary, and some may achieve these skills earlier or later than others. Caregivers should provide a safe environment that encourages exploration and movement to support their infant's physical development.
