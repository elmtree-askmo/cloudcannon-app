    Common urological conditions and their associated urinary symptoms include:\n\n1. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**:\n   - Symptoms: Frequent urination, urgency, nocturia (nighttime urination), weak urine stream, difficulty starting urination, and incomplete bladder emptying.\n\n2. **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**:\n   - Symptoms: Dysuria (pain or burning during urination), frequent urination, urgency, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and sometimes fever or chills.\n\n3. **Urinary Incontinence**:\n   - Symptoms: Involuntary leakage of urine, which can manifest as:\n     - **Stress Incontinence**: Leakage during physical activities like coughing or sneezing.\n     - **Urge Incontinence**: Sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary loss of urine.\n\n4. **Bladder Cancer**:\n   - Symptoms: Hematuria (blood in urine), frequent urination, urgency, and pelvic pain.\n\n5. **Prostatitis**:\n   - Symptoms: Painful urination, pelvic pain, difficulty urinating, and sometimes flu-like symptoms.\n\n6. **Detrusor Overactivity**:\n   - Symptoms: Urgency, frequency, and nocturia, often leading to urge incontinence.\n\n7. **Neurogenic Bladder**:\n   - Symptoms: Inability to control urination, which can lead to urinary retention or incontinence, depending on the type of nerve damage.\n\n8. **Bladder Outlet Obstruction**:\n   - Symptoms: Weak urine stream, straining to urinate, incomplete bladder emptying, and urinary retention.\n\n9. **Chronic Urinary Retention**:\n   - Symptoms: Difficulty urinating, weak stream, and a feeling of fullness in the bladder.\n\n10. **Bladder Dysfunction**:\n    - Symptoms: Vary widely but can include urgency, frequency, incontinence, and difficulty emptying the bladder.\n\nThese conditions often require specific diagnostic and management approaches tailored to the underlying cause of the symptoms.
