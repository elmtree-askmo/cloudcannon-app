    What is the palmar grasp reflex and how is it assessed in newborns?
answer: >-
    The palmar grasp reflex is a primitive, involuntary response observed in newborns, characterized by the baby's ability to grasp an object placed in their palm. This reflex typically appears at birth and can be elicited by stroking the palm or placing an object, such as a finger or small toy, into the infant's hand. When stimulated, the infant's fingers will flex and grip the object tightly, demonstrating a strong but unpredictable grip.\n\nTo assess the palmar grasp reflex, the infant should be laid in a symmetrical supine position, ensuring they are comfortable. The assessment involves gently placing an object in the infant's palm or stroking the palm to elicit the reflex. The presence of this reflex is an important indicator of the infant's neurological development and typically persists until the infant is about 4 to 6 months old. As the infant matures, the reflex diminishes, allowing for more voluntary control over grasping and releasing objects.\n\nOverall, the palmar grasp reflex is one of several newborn reflexes that serve as critical indicators of an infant's health and neurological function during early assessments.
