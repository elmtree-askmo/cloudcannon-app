    How does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) classify pregnancy terms?
answer: >-
    The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) classifies pregnancy terms into four specific categories to provide clarity and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. This classification replaces the previous broad term "term pregnancy" and includes the following categories:\n\n1. **Early Term**: This category encompasses pregnancies that reach between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days of gestation (37 0/7 weeks to 38 6/7 weeks).\n   \n2. **Full Term**: This classification includes pregnancies that last from 39 weeks 0 days to 40 weeks 6 days of gestation (39 0/7 weeks to 40 6/7 weeks). This period is considered optimal for delivery, as babies born during this time have the best chance of being healthy.\n\n3. **Late Term**: Pregnancies that extend from 41 weeks 0 days to 41 weeks 6 days of gestation (41 0/7 weeks to 41 6/7 weeks) fall into this category.\n\n4. **Post-Term**: This category refers to pregnancies that reach or exceed 42 weeks 0 days of gestation (42 0/7 weeks and beyond).\n\nThis classification system was developed to address the varying risks associated with different gestational ages and to promote better health outcomes for both mothers and infants. ACOG, along with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), encourages the uniform use of these designations by clinicians and researchers to facilitate data reporting and improve the quality of healthcare.
