    What role do antibodies play in the immune response mediated by B lymphocytes?
answer: >-
    Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, play a crucial role in the immune response mediated by B lymphocytes (B cells). When B cells encounter antigens—substances that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as bacteria or viruses—they become activated and differentiate into plasma cells. These plasma cells are specialized for producing large quantities of antibodies.\n\nThe primary functions of antibodies include:\n\n1. **Neutralization**: Antibodies can bind to pathogens or toxins, preventing them from entering or damaging host cells. For example, an antibody can attach to a virus, blocking its ability to infect a normal cell.\n\n2. **Opsonization**: Antibodies mark pathogens for destruction by other immune cells. This process enhances phagocytosis, where immune cells engulf and digest the marked pathogens.\n\n3. **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: Some antibodies can recruit immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to destroy infected cells. This mechanism is particularly important for eliminating cells that have been infected by viruses.\n\n4. **Complement Activation**: Antibodies can activate the complement system, a group of proteins that assist in the destruction of pathogens. This can lead to the lysis (breaking apart) of the pathogen's cell membrane.\n\n5. **Antigen Presentation**: B cells can also function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). They can process and present antigens to T cells, thereby linking the humoral and cellular immune responses.\n\nOverall, antibodies are essential for humoral immunity, providing a targeted response to specific pathogens and contributing to the overall effectiveness of the immune system in protecting the body from infections.
