    What specific interventions has the CAQM implemented to address air pollution?
answer: >-
    The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has implemented several specific interventions to address air pollution, particularly in the National Capital Region (NCR). Here are some of the key measures:\n\n1. **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**: The CAQM has amended the GRAP to introduce stricter measures aimed at controlling air pollution levels. This includes the implementation of GRAP IV measures, which involve a ban on truck entry into Delhi and a temporary halt on construction activities for public projects during periods of severe air quality.\n\n2. **Focus on Stubble Burning**: The CAQM has directed state governments, particularly Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, to strictly enforce frameworks and revised action plans to eliminate and control stubble burning, which significantly contributes to air pollution in the region.\n\n3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Enforcement**: The CAQM has increased monitoring of construction activities and has enforced stricter penalties against violations related to air quality standards. This includes the deployment of 40 teams to oversee compliance and assess mitigation measures.\n\n4. **Research and Development Initiatives**: Under its mandate, the CAQM is also involved in research and development projects aimed at understanding and mitigating air pollution. This includes the establishment of an Expert Group to formulate comprehensive policies for air quality management.\n\n5. **Public Health Precautions**: The CAQM emphasizes the importance of personal health precautions alongside institutional interventions, encouraging the public to take measures to protect themselves during periods of poor air quality.\n\n6. **Regular Meetings and Strategy Updates**: The CAQM convenes regular meetings to discuss urgent strategies and assess the effectiveness of current measures. For instance, the 19th meeting focused on critical issues such as emissions from construction and demolition activities.\n\nThese interventions reflect the CAQM's commitment to tackling air pollution through a combination of regulatory measures, enforcement actions, and public engagement. However, the effectiveness of these measures has been questioned by the Supreme Court, which has urged the CAQM to adopt more robust strategies to combat the ongoing air quality crisis in Delhi.
