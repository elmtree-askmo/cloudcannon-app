    How does CAST measure the effectiveness of its services?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) measures the effectiveness of its services primarily through the work of its internal Department, the Child Welfare Institute (CWI). This department is dedicated to conducting research and evaluation on CAST programs and initiatives. It collaborates with academic research partners and performs external evaluations on community service providers to assess the impact and effectiveness of the services offered.\n\nOne specific example of this evaluation process is the assessment of the Boost Child and Youth Advocacy Centre (CYAC) by the CWI. The evaluation had two main objectives: \n\n1. To analyze the effectiveness of the five key multidisciplinary team (MDT) services, which include police, child protection, advocates, medical, and mental health services.\n2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership and the multidisciplinary team approach itself.\n\nThrough these evaluations, CAST can gather data on the outcomes of its programs, which helps in understanding how well the services are meeting the needs of children and families in the community. This systematic approach to evaluation allows CAST to make informed decisions about program improvements and resource allocation, ensuring that they are effectively addressing the challenges faced by the populations they serve. \n\nIn summary, CAST employs a combination of internal research, collaboration with academic partners, and targeted evaluations of specific programs to measure the effectiveness of its services.
