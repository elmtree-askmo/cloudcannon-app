    What are the main components of the appendicular skeleton?
answer: >-
    The appendicular skeleton is a crucial component of the human skeletal system, consisting of 126 bones that facilitate movement and support. The main components of the appendicular skeleton include:\n\n1. **Pectoral Girdle**: This includes the clavicles (collarbones) and scapulae (shoulder blades), which connect the upper limbs to the axial skeleton.\n\n2. **Upper Limbs**: This section comprises the bones of the arms, forearms, wrists, and hands. Specifically, it includes:\n   - Humerus (upper arm bone)\n   - Radius and Ulna (forearm bones)\n   - Carpals (wrist bones)\n   - Metacarpals (bones of the hand)\n   - Phalanges (finger bones)\n\n3. **Pelvic Girdle**: This structure connects the lower limbs to the axial skeleton and consists of the hip bones (coxal bones), which are formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis.\n\n4. **Lower Limbs**: This section includes the bones of the thighs, legs, and feet, specifically:\n   - Femur (thigh bone)\n   - Patella (kneecap)\n   - Tibia and Fibula (bones of the lower leg)\n   - Tarsals (ankle bones)\n   - Metatarsals (bones of the foot)\n   - Phalanges (toe bones)\n\nThe appendicular skeleton plays a vital role in locomotion, manipulation of objects, and overall interaction with the environment, making it essential for daily activities and physical movement.
