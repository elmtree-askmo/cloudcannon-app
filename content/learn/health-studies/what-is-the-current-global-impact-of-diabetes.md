    What is the current global impact of diabetes?
answer: >-
    The current global impact of diabetes is significant and alarming. As of 2023, more than half a billion people are living with diabetes worldwide, with projections indicating that this number could more than double to 1.3 billion by 2050. This increase is expected to affect men, women, and children across all countries, highlighting the universal nature of this health crisis.\n\nDiabetes is a major public health issue, recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability globally. The condition is particularly concerning due to its association with other chronic health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol. The prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled since 1990, with approximately 800 million adults currently affected. This rapid rise poses challenges for health systems worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where three out of four adults with diabetes reside.\n\nThe burden of diabetes is primarily driven by type 2 diabetes, which accounted for 96% of diabetes cases in 2021. High body mass index (BMI) is a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes, with over half of the global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to this condition linked to high BMI.\n\nGeographically, the highest rates of diabetes are found in North Africa and the Middle East, with projections indicating a further increase in prevalence in these regions. The urgency for global action is underscored by the need to address rising disease rates and treatment gaps, particularly in LMICs.\n\nIn summary, diabetes represents a critical public health challenge that requires immediate and coordinated efforts to improve prevention, early diagnosis, and management strategies worldwide. The implications of this epidemic extend beyond individual health, affecting healthcare systems and economies globally.
