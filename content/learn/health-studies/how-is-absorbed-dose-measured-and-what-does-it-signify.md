    How is absorbed dose measured and what does it signify?
answer: >-
    Absorbed dose is a critical measurement in the field of radiation, particularly in medical imaging and radiation therapy. It quantifies the amount of energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a given mass of material, typically expressed in units of gray (Gy) or rad. \n\n1. **Definition**: The absorbed dose is defined as the energy deposited per unit mass in an absorbing medium, such as human tissue. It is a measurable, physical quantity that reflects the energy transferred from radiation to the material it interacts with.\n\n2. **Units of Measurement**: The absorbed dose is measured in two primary units:\n   - **Gray (Gy)**: The SI unit, where 1 Gy is equivalent to 1 joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of material.\n   - **Rad**: The older unit, where 1 rad is defined as the absorption of 100 ergs of energy per gram of material. The relationship between the two units is that 1 Gy = 100 rad.\n\n3. **Significance**: The absorbed dose is crucial for several reasons:\n   - It helps in assessing the potential biological effects of radiation on living tissues, which is essential for both radiation protection and therapeutic applications.\n   - In medical contexts, it is used to calculate the dose uptake in living tissues, aiding in the planning of radiation therapy and ensuring that doses are within safe limits for patients.\n   - It allows for the comparison of radiation effects across different types of radiation and materials.\n\n4. **Calculation**: The absorbed dose can be calculated based on the total energy absorbed (in joules) divided by the mass (in kilograms) of the affected tissue or organ. \n\n5. **Limitations**: While absorbed dose provides a measure of energy deposition, it does not account for the biological effects of different types of radiation on human tissues. For this purpose, other measures such as dose equivalent (measured in sieverts, Sv) are used, which take into consideration the type of radiation and its biological impact.\n\nIn summary, the absorbed dose is a fundamental concept in radiation measurement, providing essential information for both medical applications and radiation safety.
