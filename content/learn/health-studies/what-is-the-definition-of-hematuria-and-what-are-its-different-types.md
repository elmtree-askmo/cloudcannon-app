    What is the definition of hematuria and what are its different types?
answer: >-
    Hematuria is defined as the abnormal presence of blood in the urine. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed urological disorders, accounting for over 20% of all urological evaluations. Hematuria can be classified into two main types based on visibility:\n\n1. **Gross Hematuria**: This type occurs when blood is visible in the urine, causing it to appear red, brown, or tea-colored. Patients can see the blood without the need for a microscope.\n\n2. **Microscopic Hematuria**: In this case, the urine appears normal to the naked eye, but blood can be detected through microscopic examination or laboratory tests, such as a urinalysis.\n\nAdditionally, hematuria can be further classified based on its timing and potential underlying causes:\n\n- **Initial Hematuria**: Blood is present at the beginning of urination, which may suggest urethral disease.\n- **Intervoid Hematuria**: Blood is observed between voiding, indicating possible lesions at the distal urethra or meatus.\n- **Total Hematuria**: Blood is visible throughout the entire process of urination, which may suggest diseases affecting the kidneys, ureters, or bladder.\n\nThere are also specific conditions associated with hematuria, such as "joggers hematuria," which occurs due to recurrent trauma to the bladder during activities like jogging or long-distance running.\n\nUnderstanding the type and potential causes of hematuria is crucial for diagnosis and treatment, as it can indicate various underlying health issues within the urinary tract.
