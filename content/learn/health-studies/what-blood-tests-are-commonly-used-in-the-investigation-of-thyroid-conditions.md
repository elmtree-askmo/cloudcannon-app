    What blood tests are commonly used in the investigation of thyroid conditions?
answer: >-
    In the investigation of thyroid conditions, several blood tests are commonly utilized to assess thyroid function and diagnose various disorders. The most significant tests include:\n\n1. **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)**: This is often the first test ordered to evaluate thyroid function. High levels of TSH typically indicate hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), while low levels suggest hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid).\n\n2. **Free Thyroxine (FT4)**: This test measures the level of free thyroxine, one of the primary hormones produced by the thyroid gland. It helps in diagnosing conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.\n\n3. **Triiodothyronine (T3)**: This test measures the level of T3, another hormone produced by the thyroid. It is particularly useful in diagnosing hyperthyroidism, especially when TSH levels are low but FT4 levels are normal.\n\n4. **T3 Resin Uptake (T3RU)**: This test is used as an indirect measure of serum T3 levels and can help assess thyroid function in conjunction with other tests.\n\n5. **Thyroid Antibodies**: Tests for specific antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), can help diagnose autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease.\n\n6. **Thyroglobulin**: This test measures the level of thyroglobulin, a protein produced by the thyroid gland, and is often used in monitoring patients with a history of thyroid cancer.\n\nThese tests are crucial for diagnosing various thyroid conditions, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, and thyroid cancer. The results of these tests must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical status to provide an accurate diagnosis and guide treatment options.
