    What constitutional symptoms are associated with lymphoma?
answer: >-
    Constitutional symptoms associated with lymphoma are non-specific symptoms that can indicate the presence of the disease. These symptoms often reflect the body's response to the malignancy and can include:\n\n1. **Fever**: Persistent or intermittent fevers that are not due to an infection.\n2. **Night Sweats**: Excessive sweating during the night that can soak clothing and bedding.\n3. **Weight Loss**: Unintentional weight loss, often defined as losing more than 10% of body weight over a period of six months.\n4. **Fatigue**: A general feeling of tiredness or lack of energy that does not improve with rest.\n\nThese constitutional symptoms are significant as they can help differentiate lymphoma from other conditions and are often part of the clinical presentation that leads to further investigation and diagnosis. In addition to these symptoms, lymphoma may also present with **painless lymphadenopathy** (swelling of lymph nodes) and **abdominal swelling** if lymph nodes in the abdomen are involved. \n\nUnderstanding these symptoms is crucial for early detection and treatment of lymphoma, which can significantly impact patient outcomes.
