    What are the different types of Tic Disorders?
answer: >-
    Tic disorders are classified into three main types according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). These types are:\n\n1. **Provisional Tic Disorder**: This is the most common type of tic disorder, characterized by the presence of motor and/or vocal tics for less than one year. It often occurs in children and typically resolves on its own over time.\n\n2. **Persistent (Chronic) Tic Disorder**: In this type, individuals have either motor or vocal tics (but not both) that persist for more than one year, with the onset occurring before the age of 18. \n\n3. **Tourette Syndrome**: This is considered the most severe form of tic disorder. It involves both motor and vocal tics that have been present for more than one year. Tourette syndrome typically begins in childhood, often between the ages of 4 and 6, and is more prevalent in males than females, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 3:1. The severity of tics usually peaks around ages 10 to 12 and may decrease during adolescence.\n\nThese classifications help in understanding the nature and duration of tics, which can vary significantly among individuals.
