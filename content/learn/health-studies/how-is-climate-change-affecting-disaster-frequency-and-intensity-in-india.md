    How is climate change affecting disaster frequency and intensity in India?
answer: >-
    Climate change is significantly affecting disaster frequency and intensity in India, leading to a range of severe environmental challenges. The country has been experiencing an increase in extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, and droughts, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to rising global temperatures.\n\n1. **Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events**: Research indicates that the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events (ERE) in India have been on the rise. Analysis of 72 years of gridded rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows a clear trend of increasing ERE, which has resulted in substantial disasters across the country.\n\n2. **Impact on Health and Society**: The health impacts of climate change are severe, with record-breaking heatwaves affecting millions. For instance, in 2023, individuals in India were exposed to over 2,400 hours of heat stress conditions, equivalent to 100 days of moderate risk from outdoor activities. This has profound implications for public health and safety.\n\n3. **Natural Disasters**: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that India could face multiple climate change-induced disasters, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. The combination of environmental degradation and climate change is particularly detrimental to marginalized populations, who are often the most affected by such disasters.\n\n4. **Urbanization and Vulnerability**: With more than 30% of India's population now living in urban areas, the risks associated with urban flooding and other climate-related disasters are heightened. Urban infrastructure is often ill-equipped to handle the increased intensity of these events, leading to significant socio-economic impacts.\n\n5. **Collaborative Response Strategies**: In response to these challenges, initiatives like the EPIC Response framework (Enable, Plan, Invest, Control) have been proposed to enhance disaster risk management. This framework emphasizes the need for collaboration among various water agencies and a joint government response to effectively address the dual challenges of floods and droughts.\n\nIn summary, climate change is a critical factor driving the increased frequency and intensity of disasters in India, necessitating urgent action and comprehensive strategies to mitigate its impacts and enhance resilience among vulnerable populations.
