    What are the key characteristics of the intensive case management model?
answer: >-
    The Intensive Case Management (ICM) model is characterized by several key features that distinguish it from other case management approaches. Here are the primary characteristics of the ICM model:\n\n1. **Community-Based Care**: ICM is designed to provide long-term care for individuals with severe mental illness in a community setting, rather than in institutional environments. This approach aims to support clients in their own communities, facilitating better integration and quality of life.\n\n2. **Small Caseloads**: A defining feature of ICM is the emphasis on maintaining a small caseload for case managers, typically fewer than 20 clients. This allows for more personalized and intensive support for each individual.\n\n3. **High-Intensity Input**: ICM involves a high level of engagement and interaction between the case manager and the client. Case managers provide comprehensive services directly, rather than merely coordinating care from other providers. This includes regular check-ins and individualized attention to address the client's specific needs.\n\n4. **Relationship Building**: The model relies heavily on the case manager's ability to build a strong, trusting relationship with clients. This relationship is crucial for understanding the client's needs and helping them achieve their recovery goals.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Services**: ICM addresses a wide range of social and health needs, including outreach, counseling, skill development, family support, and crisis intervention. The case manager often accompanies clients to appointments and assists them in navigating various services.\n\n6. **Focus on Recovery**: The primary goal of ICM is to support clients in their recovery journey, helping them to manage their conditions effectively and improve their overall well-being.\n\n7. **Adaptability**: While ICM was originally developed for mental health and addiction recovery, it has been adapted for use with a broader range of clients facing complex needs, demonstrating its versatility in various contexts.\n\nThese characteristics make the Intensive Case Management model particularly effective for individuals with severe mental health issues, as it provides the necessary support and resources to facilitate their recovery and integration into the community.
