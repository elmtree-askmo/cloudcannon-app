    What are the different types of hazardous safety symbols used in households?
answer: >-
    Hazardous safety symbols are critical for identifying potential dangers associated with household chemical products. These symbols are part of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, which aims to ensure safety in handling and using these products. Here are some common types of hazardous safety symbols you may encounter in households:\n\n1. **Flame**: Indicates that the product is flammable or self-heating. This symbol warns users to keep the product away from heat sources and open flames.\n\n2. **Corrosion**: Depicted as a test tube pouring a substance onto a hand and a surface, this symbol signifies that the product can cause severe skin burns and eye damage, or it may corrode metals.\n\n3. **Exclamation Mark**: This symbol indicates that the product may cause irritation to the skin, eyes, or respiratory system. It also warns of potential hazards like narcotic effects or environmental damage.\n\n4. **Skull and Crossbones**: This symbol warns of acute toxicity, indicating that the product can be fatal or cause serious harm if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin.\n\n5. **Gas Cylinder**: Represents gases under pressure, which can explode if heated or punctured. This symbol is commonly found on products like aerosol sprays.\n\n6. **Radiation**: Known as the trefoil symbol, it signifies the presence of ionizing radiation, which can be harmful to living tissue.\n\n7. **Explosive**: Indicates that the product can explode under certain conditions, such as exposure to heat, impact, or pressure.\n\n8. **Environmental Hazard**: This symbol warns that the product may cause damage to the environment, particularly aquatic life.\n\nEach of these symbols typically includes a pictogram, a frame, and caution (signal) words underneath the image, which together convey the specific risks associated with the product. Understanding these symbols is essential for safe handling, storage, and disposal of household chemicals, helping to prevent accidents and injuries. \n\nIn summary, hazardous safety symbols serve as vital warnings for consumers, enabling them to recognize and mitigate risks associated with various household products.
