    What are the risk factors associated with Type II diabetes mellitus?
answer: >-
    Type 2 diabetes mellitus is influenced by a variety of risk factors, which can be categorized into non-modifiable and modifiable factors.\n\n### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:\n1. **Family History**: A family history of type 2 diabetes increases the risk, particularly if parents or siblings have the condition.\n2. **Age**: Individuals aged 45 or older are at a higher risk.\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Certain racial and ethnic groups, including Hispanic/Latino, Black, Asian American, and Native American populations, have a higher predisposition to developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n### Modifiable Risk Factors:\n1. **Overweight and Obesity**: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher significantly increases the risk. For Asian Americans, a BMI of 23 or higher is considered overweight, while for Pacific Islanders, it is 26 or higher.\n2. **Physical Inactivity**: Being physically active less than three times a week contributes to a higher risk.\n3. **Gestational Diabetes**: A history of gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more increases the risk.\n4. **High Blood Pressure**: Individuals with hypertension are at an elevated risk.\n5. **Prediabetes**: Having prediabetes is a strong indicator of potential progression to type 2 diabetes.\n6. **Waist Circumference**: Men with a waist circumference greater than 40 inches and women with a waist circumference greater than 35 inches are at increased risk, as these measurements indicate abdominal fat.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Low Birth Weight**: Children and teens may also be at higher risk if they were born with a low birth weight or if their mother had gestational diabetes during pregnancy.\n- **Sleep Patterns**: Lack of sleep has been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhile some risk factors, such as family history and age, cannot be changed, individuals can take proactive steps to manage modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, increasing physical activity, and monitoring blood pressure and glucose levels.
