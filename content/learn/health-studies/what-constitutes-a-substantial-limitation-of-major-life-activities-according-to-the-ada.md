    What constitutes a substantial limitation of major life activities according to the ADA?
answer: >-
    According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a substantial limitation of major life activities is determined through a broad interpretation of the term "substantially limits." The ADA regulations provide several guidelines to help identify whether an impairment substantially limits an individual in a major life activity:\n\n1. **Broad Construction**: The term "substantially limits" is to be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage. This means that an impairment does not need to completely or severely limit a major life activity to be considered substantially limiting.\n\n2. **Comparison to General Population**: When assessing whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it is useful to compare the individual's condition, manner, and duration of performing that activity to that of most people in the general population. This includes considering:\n   - The difficulty, effort, or time required to perform the major life activity.\n   - Any pain experienced while performing the activity.\n   - The length of time the individual can perform the activity.\n   - The way the impairment affects the operation of a major bodily function.\n\n3. **Episodic Impairments**: The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) clarifies that impairments that are episodic or in remission can still be considered disabilities if they would substantially limit a major life activity when active.\n\n4. **Mitigating Measures**: The ADAAA specifies that the positive effects of mitigating measures (such as medication or assistive devices) should not be considered when determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting. This means that individuals may still be covered by the ADA even if they are using measures that lessen the impact of their impairment.\n\n5. **Non-Exhaustive List of Major Life Activities**: The ADAAA expanded the list of major life activities to include not only traditional activities like walking, seeing, and hearing, but also other activities such as reading, sitting, and interacting with others.\n\nIn summary, a substantial limitation of major life activities under the ADA is assessed through a broad lens, focusing on the individual's experience compared to the general population, and considering the effects of impairments without regard to mitigating measures. This approach aims to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the protections and accommodations they need.
