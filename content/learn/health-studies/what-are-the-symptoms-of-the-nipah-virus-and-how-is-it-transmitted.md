    What are the symptoms of the Nipah virus and how is it transmitted?
answer: >-
    The Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can cause a range of illnesses in humans, from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The symptoms of Nipah virus infection typically manifest within 3 to 14 days after exposure and can include:\n\n- Fever\n- Headache\n- Cough\n- Sore throat\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Muscle aches\n- Vomiting\n- Confusion\n\nIn severe cases, the infection can lead to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), coma, and potentially death, with mortality rates ranging from 50% to 75% among those infected. Complications may also include seizures following recovery.\n\nTransmission of the Nipah virus occurs primarily from animals to humans, particularly from fruit bats (the natural reservoir) and pigs (intermediate hosts). Human-to-human transmission has been documented, especially among family members and caregivers of infected individuals, often occurring in healthcare settings. Additionally, the virus can be transmitted through contaminated food.\n\nOverall, the Nipah virus poses significant public health concerns, particularly in regions where outbreaks have been reported, such as South and Southeast Asia.
