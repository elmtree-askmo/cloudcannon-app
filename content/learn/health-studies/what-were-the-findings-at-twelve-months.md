    What were the findings at twelve months?
answer: >-
    At twelve months, findings from various community-based diabetes prevention programs indicate significant outcomes related to weight loss and risk factor modification. For instance, participants in the lifestyle intervention of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) achieved a mean weight loss of 5.0% of their initial body weight, compared to only 1.1% in the control group. This level of weight loss is clinically significant, as it is associated with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\nIn the context of the Community-based Prevention of Diabetes (ComPoD) trial, the prototype "Living Well, Taking Control" (LWTC) program demonstrated that participants who attended all four group sessions experienced a mean weight loss difference of −2.2 kg compared to controls, with a more pronounced difference of −3.0 kg in the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that community-based lifestyle modification programs are effective in reducing important risk factors for diabetes in individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, with sustained benefits observed at the twelve-month mark. Future studies are encouraged to further validate these results and explore long-term effects.
