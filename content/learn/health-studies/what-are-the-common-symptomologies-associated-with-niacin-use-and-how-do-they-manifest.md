answer: >-
    Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, is associated with several symptomologies, particularly when used in pharmacological doses or when consumed in excess. The common symptoms associated with niacin use, especially at high doses, include:\n\n1. **Flushing**: This is one of the most well-known side effects of niacin. It occurs due to vasodilation, which leads to increased blood flow to the skin, resulting in a warm, red, and often itchy sensation. This flushing can be uncomfortable and is typically more pronounced with immediate-release formulations of niacin.\n\n2. **Itching**: Alongside flushing, users may experience itching, which can be localized or widespread. This symptom is often related to the same vasodilatory effects that cause flushing.\n\n3. **Gastrointestinal Distress**: High doses of niacin can lead to gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can be particularly bothersome and may lead to discontinuation of niacin therapy.\n\n4. **Hepatotoxicity**: Chronic use of high doses of niacin, especially in the form of supplements, can lead to liver damage. Symptoms of hepatotoxicity may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and elevated liver enzymes, which can be detected through blood tests.\n\n5. **Other Symptoms**: Some individuals may also report headaches, dizziness, and a general feeling of malaise when taking high doses of niacin.\n\nIt is important to note that the tolerable upper intake level for niacin is set at 35 mg per day for adults to prevent these adverse effects. Newer formulations of niacin, such as "non-flush" versions, have been developed to minimize flushing and other side effects while still providing the cholesterol-lowering benefits associated with niacin therapy.\n\nIn summary, while niacin can be beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, its use, particularly at high doses, can lead to a range of symptoms including flushing, itching, gastrointestinal distress, and potential liver damage.
