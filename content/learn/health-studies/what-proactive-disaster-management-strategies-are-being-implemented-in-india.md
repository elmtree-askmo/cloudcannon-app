    What proactive disaster management strategies are being implemented in India?
answer: >-
    India has implemented several proactive disaster management strategies aimed at building a safe and disaster-resilient nation. The cornerstone of these strategies is the National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM), established in 2009, which emphasizes a holistic, proactive, technology-driven, and multi-disaster approach to prevention, mitigation, preparedness, and response.\n\nKey components of India's disaster management strategies include:\n\n1. **National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP)**: This plan outlines the national disaster framework, detailing the institutional and policy mechanisms for disaster management. It covers objectives, strategies, interventions, and the agencies involved in various phases of disaster management.\n\n2. **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)**: Established to provide a rapid response to natural calamities, the NDRF plays a crucial role in disaster response and recovery efforts. The NDRF Academy is also involved in training and capacity building for disaster management personnel.\n\n3. **State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF)**: Recommended by the Fifteenth Finance Commission, this fund aims to enhance the financial resources available for state-level disaster management initiatives.\n\n4. **Aapda Mitra Scheme**: Launched with an outlay of â‚¹369.40 crore, this scheme aims to train 100,000 individuals in disaster preparedness and response, thereby enhancing local capacities and resilience.\n\n5. **Community-Based Disaster Risk Management**: Programs focusing on community engagement, particularly involving children and adolescents, are being implemented to support resilience initiatives in both urban and rural settings.\n\n6. **National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR)**: This platform facilitates discussions and strategies to strengthen disaster management systems at the local level, with themes such as "Building Local Resilience in a Changing Climate" being central to its agenda.\n\n7. **Collaboration with NGOs and International Agencies**: The government collaborates with various non-governmental and international organizations to enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities.\n\n8. **Focus on Vulnerable Populations**: The NPDM emphasizes a caring approach towards the needs of vulnerable sections of society, ensuring that disaster management strategies are inclusive and equitable.\n\nThrough these strategies, India aims to foster a culture of prevention, mitigation, preparedness, and response, thereby enhancing its overall disaster management capabilities and resilience against both natural and man-made disasters.
