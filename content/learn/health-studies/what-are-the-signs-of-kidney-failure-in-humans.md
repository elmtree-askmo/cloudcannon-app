    What are the signs of kidney failure in humans?
answer: >-
    Kidney failure, whether acute or chronic, can manifest through a variety of signs and symptoms. Here are some of the most common indicators that may suggest kidney failure in humans:\n\n1. **Swelling**: One of the most noticeable signs is swelling in various parts of the body, particularly in the face, hands, feet, and legs. This occurs due to the kidneys' inability to remove excess fluid and salt from the body.\n\n2. **Fatigue**: A significant decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood, resulting in feelings of tiredness or weakness.\n\n3. **Urinary Changes**: Individuals may experience changes in urine output, such as decreased urine production or changes in the frequency of urination. This can include less urine output or, conversely, an increase in urination, especially at night.\n\n4. **Shortness of Breath**: Fluid buildup in the lungs can lead to difficulty breathing, which is a serious symptom that requires immediate medical attention.\n\n5. **Nausea and Vomiting**: The accumulation of waste products in the blood can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting.\n\n6. **Confusion or Cognitive Changes**: A buildup of toxins can affect brain function, leading to confusion, difficulty concentrating, or a general feeling of mental fog.\n\n7. **Itching**: Severe itching can occur due to the accumulation of waste products in the blood, which the kidneys are unable to filter out.\n\n8. **Irregular Heartbeat**: Electrolyte imbalances caused by kidney failure can lead to irregular heart rhythms, which can be dangerous.\n\n9. **Pain**: Some individuals may experience pain in the abdomen or in the sides below the rib cage, which can be associated with kidney issues.\n\n10. **Headaches**: Persistent headaches can also be a symptom of kidney failure, often related to the buildup of toxins or changes in blood pressure.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly, as kidney failure can lead to serious complications if not addressed. Regular check-ups and monitoring are essential, especially for individuals at higher risk, such as those with diabetes or high blood pressure.
