    What recent natural disasters have occurred in Kerala, and what were their impacts?
answer: >-
    Recent natural disasters in Kerala have included significant landslides and heavy rainfall, particularly noted on July 30, 2024. This event resulted in catastrophic landslides in the hilly regions of Wayanad, leading to the loss of over 361 lives, with ongoing concerns that the death toll may rise as rescue operations continue. The landslides have destroyed more than 200 buildings, highlighting the severe impact on infrastructure and housing in the affected areas.\n\nKerala has a history of vulnerability to natural disasters, particularly landslides and floods, due to its hilly terrain and climatic conditions. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has identified Kerala as a major hotspot for landslide risk, with 10 out of the 30 most landslide-prone districts in India located within the state. The region has experienced a troubling trend of increasing fatalities from such disasters, with previous years reporting 72 deaths in 2019, 70 in 2020, and 78 in 2023.\n\nThe recent landslide incidents are considered the worst disaster to hit Kerala since the devastating floods of 2018, which resulted in over 400 fatalities. The ongoing heavy rainfall and the associated risks of further landslides and flooding have prompted the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority to issue warnings and mobilize rescue efforts.\n\nOverall, the impacts of these natural disasters in Kerala are profound, affecting not only the immediate safety and health of the population but also the long-term socio-economic stability of the region.
