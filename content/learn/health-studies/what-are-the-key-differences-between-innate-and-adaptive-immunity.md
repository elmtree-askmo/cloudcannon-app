    What are the key differences between innate and adaptive immunity?
answer: >-
    The immune system is divided into two main types: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Here are the key differences between them:\n\n1. **Presence**:\n   - **Innate Immunity**: This type of immunity is always present in the body and serves as the first line of defense against pathogens.\n   - **Adaptive Immunity**: This immunity is not pre-existing; it develops in response to exposure to specific foreign substances (antigens).\n\n2. **Specificity**:\n   - **Innate Immunity**: It is non-specific, meaning it does not differentiate between different types of pathogens. It responds to all invaders in a similar manner.\n   - **Adaptive Immunity**: This immunity is highly specific, targeting particular pathogens based on their unique antigens.\n\n3. **Response Time**:\n   - **Innate Immunity**: The response is rapid, occurring immediately or within hours of the pathogen's appearance.\n   - **Adaptive Immunity**: The response is slower, typically taking 1-2 weeks to develop after the initial exposure to the antigen.\n\n4. **Potency and Memory**:\n   - **Innate Immunity**: While it provides immediate protection, it does not have a memory component; it responds the same way to repeated infections.\n   - **Adaptive Immunity**: It has a memory component, allowing for a more potent and faster response upon subsequent exposures to the same pathogen.\n\n5. **Components**:\n   - **Innate Immunity**: This system includes physical barriers (like skin and mucous membranes), phagocytic cells (such as macrophages and neutrophils), natural killer cells, and various proteins (like complement proteins).\n   - **Adaptive Immunity**: This system primarily involves lymphocytes, specifically T cells (which include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells) and B cells (which produce antibodies).\n\nIn summary, innate immunity provides immediate, non-specific defense against pathogens, while adaptive immunity develops over time, offering specific and long-lasting protection.
