    How are Audiologists and Speech Therapists categorized in the classification?
answer: >-
    Audiologists and speech therapists are categorized under the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) as part of the health workforce. Specifically, they fall under the minor group 2266, which is designated for "Audiologists and speech therapists." This classification reflects their roles in screening, identifying, evaluating, and treating communication disorders, as well as their efforts to correct or alleviate speech, language, or hearing impairments through planned therapeutic interventions.\n\nAccording to the data extracted from the WHO National Health Workforce Accounts platform, there is a significant representation of audiologists and speech therapists across over 30 countries, with a total of 80 data points collected. In terms of registration statistics, the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) reported a total of 3,266 registered professionals in this field, with the majority being female (94.7%).\n\nThe classification of audiologists and speech therapists is crucial for global health workforce management, as it aids in the comparability of health worker data across different regions and supports the implementation of health worker classification systems. This structured approach is essential for improving health worker data and ensuring that the workforce is adequately trained and qualified to meet the health needs of populations.
