    What are the primary causes and modes of transmission for Tuberculosis (TB)?
answer: >-
    Tuberculosis (TB) is primarily caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This pathogen primarily affects the lungs but can also spread to other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, spine, and brain. \n\n### Primary Causes:\n1. **Causative Agent**: The main cause of TB is the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis, can also cause TB disease in humans, although they are less common.\n2. **Risk Factors**: Certain factors can increase the risk of a latent TB infection becoming active, including a weakened immune system, age (particularly in children under five), and other health conditions.\n\n### Modes of Transmission:\n1. **Airborne Transmission**: TB is primarily transmitted through the air. When a person with infectious TB (especially pulmonary or laryngeal TB) coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings, they release tiny infectious droplets, known as droplet nuclei, into the air. These droplets are typically 1-5 microns in diameter and can remain suspended in the air for several hours.\n2. **Inhalation of Droplets**: Individuals nearby can inhale these droplet nuclei, leading to potential infection. This mode of transmission makes TB highly contagious in crowded or poorly ventilated environments.\n\nIn summary, TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is primarily transmitted through airborne particles released by an infected person. Understanding these causes and modes of transmission is crucial for effective prevention and control measures.
