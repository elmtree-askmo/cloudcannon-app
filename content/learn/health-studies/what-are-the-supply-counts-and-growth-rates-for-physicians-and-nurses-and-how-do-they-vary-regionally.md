answer: >-
    The supply counts and growth rates for physicians and nurses in Canada reveal important trends that vary regionally. Here are the key statistics and insights based on the gathered information:\n\n### Physician Supply Trends\n- **Overall Growth Rate (2021):** The total number of licensed physicians in Canada increased by **2.0%**.\n- **Family Physicians (FPs):** This subgroup showed the least growth, with an increase of only **1.2%**. Notably, the growth rate for family physicians has been declining over the past decade, dropping from **3.4%** (2012-2014) to **1.3%** (2019-2021).\n\n### Nursing Supply Trends\n- **Overall Growth Rate (2021):** The supply of regulated nurses grew by **2.4%**.\n- **Nurse Practitioners (NPs):** This group experienced significant growth, with an approximate increase of **10.7%**, indicating a rising recognition of their role in healthcare delivery.\n- **Registered Nurses (RNs) and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs):** There have been increases in the numbers of RNs and LPNs, although the growth rate for LPNs has slowed in recent years.\n\n### Regional Variations\n- The distribution of healthcare providers, including physicians and nurses, varies significantly across different regions of Canada. Rural and remote areas often face a shortage of healthcare providers, which can lead to reliance on itinerant physicians and increased demand for NPs, who can provide primary care autonomously.\n- Understanding these regional variations is crucial for addressing healthcare access and quality, as they impact the availability of services and the financial sustainability of physician practices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall trends indicate a modest growth in the supply of healthcare professionals, with significant differences in growth rates among various categories of providers. The increasing number of nurse practitioners is particularly noteworthy, as they play a vital role in filling gaps in healthcare delivery, especially in underserved areas. Addressing the challenges of healthcare provider distribution is essential for improving access to care across Canada.
