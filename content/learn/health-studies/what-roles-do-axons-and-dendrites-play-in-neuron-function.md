    What roles do axons and dendrites play in neuron function?
answer: >-
    Axons and dendrites are critical components of neuron structure and function, each playing distinct but complementary roles in the transmission of information within the nervous system.\n\n### Dendrites\nDendrites are the branched extensions of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. They function as the primary sites for synaptic input, where neurotransmitters released from the axon terminals of adjacent neurons bind to specific receptors on the dendritic membrane. This binding can lead to changes in the electrical potential of the neuron, which is crucial for the initiation of an action potential if the signal is strong enough. Dendrites can be thought of as "antennae" that pick up signals from the environment or from other neurons, allowing the neuron to integrate a variety of inputs.\n\n### Axons\nIn contrast, axons are long, slender projections that transmit electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body (soma) to other neurons, muscles, or glands. The axon is responsible for conducting action potentials, which are rapid changes in membrane potential that propagate along the length of the axon. At the axon terminals, the action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, facilitating communication with the next neuron or target tissue. Axons can also be myelinated, which increases the speed of signal transmission through a process known as saltatory conduction.\n\n### Summary of Functions\n- **Dendrites**: Receive and integrate incoming signals from other neurons or sensory inputs.\n- **Axons**: Conduct electrical impulses away from the neuron and release neurotransmitters to communicate with other cells.\n\nTogether, dendrites and axons enable neurons to perform their essential role in the nervous system, facilitating complex communication networks that underlie all neural functions, including reflexes, sensory perception, and motor control.
