    Differentiate between the cortical and medullary regions of the kidney.
answer: >-
    The kidney is divided into two main regions: the renal cortex and the renal medulla, each with distinct structures and functions.\n\n### Renal Cortex\n- **Location**: The renal cortex is the outer region of the kidney, situated just beneath the renal capsule.\n- **Structure**: It is composed of densely packed nephrons, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The cortex contains about one million nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney responsible for filtering blood.\n- **Function**: The renal cortex plays a critical role in the initial stages of urine formation. It is involved in filtering blood, removing waste products, and reabsorbing essential substances such as water, electrolytes, and nutrients. The cortex is also where the glomeruli (the filtering units) and convoluted tubules are located.\n\n### Renal Medulla\n- **Location**: The renal medulla is the inner region of the kidney, located beneath the renal cortex. It consists of 8-12 cone-shaped structures known as renal pyramids.\n- **Structure**: The medulla contains the loops of Henle and collecting ducts, which are essential for the concentration of urine. The renal pyramids have their bases facing the cortex and their apices (renal papillae) pointing towards the renal pelvis.\n- **Function**: The primary function of the renal medulla is to facilitate the reabsorption of water and ions, thereby concentrating urine. The medullary interstitium, which surrounds the loops of Henle, plays a role in maintaining a hypertonic environment that is crucial for water reabsorption.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n- **Position**: The cortex is the outer layer, while the medulla is the inner layer of the kidney.\n- **Composition**: The cortex contains glomeruli and convoluted tubules, whereas the medulla contains loops of Henle and collecting ducts.\n- **Function**: The cortex is primarily involved in filtration and reabsorption, while the medulla is focused on urine concentration and water reabsorption.\n\nTogether, these regions work in concert to maintain homeostasis, regulate blood pressure, and ensure the efficient excretion of waste products from the body.
