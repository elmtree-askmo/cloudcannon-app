    Can you explain the menstrual phase of the uterine cycle?
answer: >-
    The menstrual phase is the first phase of the uterine cycle, marking the beginning of the menstrual cycle itself. It typically lasts from about 3 to 7 days, with day one being the first day of menstrual bleeding. This phase occurs when the hormone progesterone levels drop significantly, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining (endometrium) that had thickened in preparation for a potential pregnancy.\n\nDuring the menstrual phase, the body expels the unfertilized egg along with the endometrial tissue, blood, and mucus through the vagina. This process is commonly referred to as menstruation or a period. The menstrual flow consists of a combination of uterine tissue, blood, and other fluids.\n\nThe menstrual phase is crucial as it signifies the start of a new cycle, allowing the body to reset and prepare for the next ovulation and potential fertilization. Following the menstrual phase, the cycle progresses into the proliferative phase, where the endometrium begins to rebuild in response to rising estrogen levels.
