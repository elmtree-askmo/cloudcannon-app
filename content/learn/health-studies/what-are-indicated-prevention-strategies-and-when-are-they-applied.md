    What are Indicated Prevention Strategies and when are they applied?
answer: >-
    Indicated prevention strategies are targeted interventions designed for individuals who may or may not be exhibiting early signs of substance abuse but possess identifiable risk factors that increase their likelihood of developing such issues. These risk factors can include:\n\n- School failure\n- Interpersonal social problems\n- Delinquency and other antisocial behaviors\n- Psychological issues such as depression and suicidal behavior\n\nIndicated prevention is particularly relevant for individuals who are already engaging in high-risk behaviors or who have shown early signs of substance misuse. For example, students who have been caught smoking cigarettes or adults arrested for their first DUI may be candidates for indicated prevention programs. These interventions aim to reduce harm and mitigate the risk factors associated with substance abuse, thereby preventing the onset of more severe substance use disorders.\n\nThe application of indicated prevention strategies is crucial in addressing the needs of asymptomatic individuals who are at risk, as it allows for early intervention before more serious problems develop. This approach is part of a broader continuum of care in prevention and treatment, which recognizes the importance of addressing various levels of risk and need within the population.
