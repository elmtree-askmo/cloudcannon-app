    How does the foundation address food security in its programs?
answer: >-
    The Anne Maria D’Amico Foundation (AMDF) addresses food security through its partnership with the North York Women's Shelter (NYWS) and various initiatives aimed at providing essential support to individuals experiencing food insecurity. One of the key components of their approach is the Food Security Program, which is designed to ensure that residents have access to nutritious food.\n\nThe NYWS collaborates with food security partners, such as Second Harvest, which supplies 100 to 200 pounds of nutritious food weekly to the shelter. This partnership is crucial in providing residents with the necessary sustenance while they navigate their circumstances. Additionally, the shelter incorporates trauma-informed practices into its food security initiatives, recognizing the impact of trauma on individuals' relationships with food and nutrition.\n\nThe foundation's commitment to food security is also reflected in its broader programming, which includes trauma-informed community health clinics and expressive arts therapy-based counseling. These programs aim to support the overall well-being of individuals, addressing not only their immediate food needs but also the underlying issues related to trauma and stress that can affect their health and nutrition.\n\nOverall, the AMDF and NYWS work together to create a supportive environment that prioritizes food security as a fundamental aspect of their services, ensuring that women, trans, and non-binary individuals have access to the resources they need to build healthier lives free from violence.
