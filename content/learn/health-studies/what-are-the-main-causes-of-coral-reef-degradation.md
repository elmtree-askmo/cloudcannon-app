    What are the main causes of coral reef degradation?
answer: >-
    Coral reef degradation is a significant environmental issue, primarily driven by a combination of global and local factors. The main causes of coral reef degradation include:\n\n1. **Climate Change**: Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that provide them with nutrients and color. This stress can result in coral death if conditions do not improve.\n\n2. **Pollution**: Human activities often result in the release of harmful chemicals and waste into the ocean. Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and sewage can degrade water quality, leading to detrimental effects on coral health and marine life.\n\n3. **Overfishing**: Unsustainable fishing practices, including the use of destructive methods such as bottom trawling, cyanide, and dynamite fishing, directly damage coral structures and deplete key reef species. Overfishing disrupts the balance of the ecosystem, particularly affecting herbivorous fish that help control algal growth, which can lead to algal overgrowth and further coral decline.\n\n4. **Habitat Destruction**: Coastal development, including the construction of resorts and urban areas, can lead to the physical destruction of coral habitats. Dredging and land reclamation can also contribute to the loss of coral reefs.\n\n5. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems. For example, the crown-of-thorns starfish, which preys on coral, can cause significant damage to coral reefs when their populations explode, often due to nutrient pollution that supports their growth.\n\n6. **Human Population Growth**: Increased human populations along coastlines lead to greater demand for resources, resulting in intensified fishing, pollution, and habitat destruction.\n\nThe degradation of coral reefs not only threatens marine biodiversity but also impacts local economies that rely on tourism and fishing. Protecting and restoring coral reefs requires a multifaceted approach, including sustainable fishing practices, pollution control, and climate change mitigation efforts.
