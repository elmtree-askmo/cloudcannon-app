    How do sudoriferous glands function in the skin?
answer: >-
    Sudoriferous glands, commonly known as sweat glands, play a crucial role in the integumentary system by regulating body temperature and excreting waste products. There are two primary types of sudoriferous glands: eccrine and apocrine.\n\n1. **Eccrine Glands**: These glands are distributed throughout most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface through pores. They are primarily responsible for thermoregulation. When the body temperature rises, eccrine glands secrete a watery fluid (sweat) that evaporates from the skin surface, helping to cool the body. The sweat produced is initially isotonic with blood plasma, but when sweating is low, the gland's duct reabsorbs some salt, conserving it. Conversely, during high sweat rates, less salt is reabsorbed, allowing more water to evaporate, which enhances evaporative cooling.\n\n2. **Apocrine Glands**: These glands are primarily located in areas such as the armpits and groin and typically open into hair follicles rather than directly onto the skin. Apocrine glands become active during puberty and are associated with body odor, as their secretions are broken down by skin bacteria into various chemicals.\n\nBoth types of sweat glands utilize a process known as merocrine secretion, where vesicles within the gland release sweat via exocytosis, leaving the cells intact. This mechanism ensures that the glands can continuously produce sweat without being damaged.\n\nIn summary, sudoriferous glands are essential for maintaining homeostasis by regulating body temperature through sweat production and excretion, while also playing a role in detoxifying the body by eliminating excess salts and unwanted chemicals.
