    How did the government defend its air quality management policies?
no_index: True
answer: >-
    I cannot answer this question based on the available information. The gathered information primarily discusses air quality management policies in a general context, including references to various regulatory frameworks and initiatives, but it does not provide specific details on how the government defended its air quality management policies. There are gaps in the information regarding the government's arguments, public statements, or specific actions taken to justify their policies.
