    How were participants selected for the study?
answer: >-
    Participants for the community-based diabetes prevention study were selected based on specific eligibility criteria. The primary criteria included adults aged 18 to 75 years who were at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This risk was determined by factors such as elevated blood glucose levels and being overweight. \n\nAdditionally, certain groups were excluded from participation, including individuals with gestational diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and prediabetes. The recruitment process involved various community settings, such as community pharmacies and clinics, as well as home or community sites, depending on participant availability. This approach aimed to ensure a diverse and representative sample of individuals who could benefit from the diabetes prevention program.\n\nOverall, the selection process was designed to identify individuals who would be most likely to respond to the intervention and contribute to the study's findings on the effectiveness of community-based diabetes prevention strategies.
