    What are the stages of fetal development during gestation?
answer: >-
    Fetal development during gestation is typically divided into three main stages: the germinal stage, the embryonic stage, and the fetal stage. Each stage encompasses significant growth and development milestones.\n\n### 1. Germinal Stage (Weeks 1-2)\n- **Fertilization**: The process begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming a zygote.\n- **Cell Division**: The zygote undergoes rapid cell division as it travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus.\n- **Implantation**: By the end of the second week, the blastocyst implants itself into the uterine lining.\n\n### 2. Embryonic Stage (Weeks 3-8)\n- **Week 3**: The neural tube, which will develop into the brain and spinal cord, begins to form.\n- **Week 4**: The embryo is about 2 mm long, resembling a small poppy seed. Major organs and systems start to develop.\n- **Week 5**: Limb buds appear, and hormone levels in the mother begin to rise significantly.\n- **Week 6**: The neural tube closes, and the heart begins to beat.\n- **Week 7**: The head develops, and facial features start to form.\n- **Week 8**: The embryo is about 1/2 inch long, and the basic structure of the body is established.\n\n### 3. Fetal Stage (Weeks 9-40)\n- **Week 10**: The fetal stage begins. The organs and systems that have formed continue to grow and mature.\n- **Week 12**: By the end of the first trimester, the fetus is about 2.5 to 3 inches long and weighs approximately 1/2 ounce. Fingernails begin to form.\n- **Week 14**: The fetus starts making facial expressions, and the mother may feel more energetic.\n- **Week 28**: The fetus can respond to light and sound, and the mother enters the third trimester.\n- **Week 40**: The gestation period culminates in birth, with the fetus fully developed and ready for life outside the womb.\n\nThroughout these stages, the fetus undergoes critical developments, including the formation of organs, limbs, and sensory systems, preparing for a successful birth. Each week brings new milestones that are essential for the health and viability of the fetus.
