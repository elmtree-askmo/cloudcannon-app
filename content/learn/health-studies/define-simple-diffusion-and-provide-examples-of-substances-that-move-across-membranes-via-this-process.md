answer: >-
    **Simple Diffusion**\n\nSimple diffusion is a passive transport process where small, nonpolar molecules move directly across the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane along their concentration gradient, from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process does not require energy or the assistance of transport proteins.\n\n### Characteristics of Simple Diffusion:\n- **Direction of Movement**: Molecules move from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.\n- **Energy Requirement**: No energy is required for this process.\n- **Molecule Type**: It is most effective for small, nonpolar molecules due to their ability to easily pass through the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the membrane.\n\n### Examples of Substances that Undergo Simple Diffusion:\n1. **Oxygen (O2)**: Essential for cellular respiration, oxygen diffuses into cells where its concentration is lower.\n2. **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: A waste product of cellular respiration, carbon dioxide diffuses out of cells into the bloodstream, where its concentration is lower.\n3. **Small Lipids**: Certain lipids, such as steroid hormones, can also diffuse through the membrane due to their nonpolar nature.\n\nIn summary, simple diffusion is a crucial mechanism for the transport of specific small, nonpolar molecules across cell membranes, facilitating essential physiological processes without the need for energy input or specialized transport proteins.
