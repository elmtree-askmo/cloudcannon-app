    What are the most common hazards associated with night driving?
answer: >-
    Driving at night presents several hazards that can significantly increase the risk of accidents. Here are some of the most common hazards associated with night driving:\n\n1. **Compromised Vision**: Human vision is less effective in low-light conditions, making it difficult to see obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles. This reduced visibility can lead to misjudging distances and speeds.\n\n2. **Glare**: Headlights from oncoming vehicles can create glare, which can temporarily blind drivers and impair their ability to see the road. This is particularly problematic for elderly drivers, who may experience disability glare more acutely.\n\n3. **Fatigue**: Many drivers are more prone to fatigue during nighttime hours, especially late at night or during long road trips. Fatigue can slow reaction times and impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of accidents.\n\n4. **Impaired Drivers**: The risk of encountering impaired or drunk drivers is higher during nighttime, particularly on weekends. This increases the chances of collisions with drivers who may not be fully in control of their vehicles.\n\n5. **Increased Accident Rates**: Statistics indicate that fatal crashes are more likely to occur at night, with peak times often occurring on Saturday nights. Common types of nighttime accidents include rear-end collisions and head-on crashes, largely due to reduced visibility and impaired judgment.\n\n6. **Environmental Factors**: Night driving can also be affected by environmental conditions such as fog, rain, or snow, which further reduce visibility and traction.\n\nTo mitigate these hazards, drivers are encouraged to keep their windshields and mirrors clean to reduce glare, ensure they are well-rested before driving, and remain vigilant for impaired drivers on the road. Understanding these risks can help drivers take necessary precautions to enhance their safety while driving at night.
