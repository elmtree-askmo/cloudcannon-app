    What happens during ovulation?
answer: >-
    During ovulation, a mature egg is released from one of the ovaries, marking a key event in the menstrual cycle. This process typically occurs around the midpoint of the cycle, approximately 14 days after the start of menstruation, although the exact timing can vary among individuals.\n\nThe process of ovulation is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones. It begins when the hypothalamus in the brain releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, while LH triggers the final maturation of the dominant follicle and the subsequent release of the egg.\n\nOvulation occurs approximately 24-36 hours after the LH surge, which is the peak level of LH in the bloodstream. The dominant follicle ruptures, releasing the egg into the fallopian tube, where it may encounter sperm for potential fertilization. \n\nDuring this time, several physiological changes may occur, including:\n- A slight increase in basal body temperature.\n- Changes in cervical mucus, which becomes clearer and more slippery, facilitating sperm movement.\n- Possible mild pelvic pain or discomfort, known as mittelschmerz, which some women may experience during ovulation.\n\nIf fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg will travel to the uterus, where it can implant into the thickened uterine lining, supported by hormones such as progesterone. If fertilization does not occur, the egg will disintegrate, and the menstrual cycle will continue, leading to menstruation.\n\nUnderstanding ovulation is crucial for tracking fertility and recognizing the signs of the menstrual cycle, which can be influenced by various factors, including stress and lifestyle changes.
