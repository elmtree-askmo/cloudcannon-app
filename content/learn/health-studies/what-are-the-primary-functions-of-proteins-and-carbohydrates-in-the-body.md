    What are the primary functions of proteins and carbohydrates in the body?
answer: >-
    Proteins and carbohydrates are two essential macromolecules in the human body, each serving distinct and vital functions.\n\n### Functions of Proteins:\n1. **Structural Support**: Proteins provide structure to cells and tissues. For example, collagen in connective tissues and keratin in hair and nails are structural proteins.\n2. **Enzymatic Activity**: Many proteins function as enzymes, which catalyze biochemical reactions, speeding up processes necessary for metabolism and other cellular functions.\n3. **Transport**: Proteins are involved in the transport of molecules across cell membranes and within the bloodstream. Hemoglobin, for instance, transports oxygen in the blood.\n4. **Defense**: Antibodies are proteins that play a crucial role in the immune response by identifying and neutralizing pathogens.\n5. **Hormonal Regulation**: Some proteins act as hormones, which are signaling molecules that regulate physiological processes. Insulin, for example, helps regulate blood sugar levels.\n6. **Movement**: Proteins such as actin and myosin are essential for muscle contraction and movement.\n\n### Functions of Carbohydrates:\n1. **Energy Source**: Carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for the body. They are broken down into glucose, which is utilized by cells for energy.\n2. **Energy Storage**: Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, providing a readily available energy source when needed.\n3. **Cell Recognition and Signaling**: Carbohydrates are involved in cell recognition processes. Glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell surfaces play key roles in cell signaling and communication.\n4. **Structural Components**: Certain carbohydrates, such as cellulose in plants, provide structural support. In humans, glycosaminoglycans contribute to the structure of connective tissues.\n5. **Regulation of Blood Sugar**: Carbohydrates help maintain blood sugar levels, providing a steady supply of energy to the body.\n\nIn summary, proteins are versatile molecules that perform a wide range of functions, including structural, enzymatic, transport, defense, hormonal, and movement roles. Carbohydrates primarily serve as energy sources and storage, as well as playing roles in cell recognition and structural integrity. Both macromolecules are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and overall health in the body.
