    How is the skeletal system divided into axial and appendicular components?
answer: >-
    The human skeletal system is divided into two primary components: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.\n\n1. **Axial Skeleton**: This component forms the central axis of the body and consists of 80 bones. It includes:\n   - **Skull**: Protects the brain and supports the facial structure.\n   - **Vertebral Column**: Also known as the spine, it provides structural support and protects the spinal cord.\n   - **Rib Cage**: Composed of ribs and the sternum, it protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs.\n   - **Hyoid Bone**: Located in the neck, it supports the tongue and is involved in swallowing.\n   - **Ossicles of the Middle Ear**: These small bones are crucial for hearing.\n\n2. **Appendicular Skeleton**: This component consists of 126 bones and is primarily involved in movement and interaction with the environment. It includes:\n   - **Upper Limbs**: Bones of the arms, forearms, hands, and the pectoral girdle (shoulder bones).\n   - **Lower Limbs**: Bones of the thighs, legs, feet, and the pelvic girdle (hip bones).\n\nThe axial skeleton serves as the main support structure for the body, while the appendicular skeleton facilitates movement and allows for a range of activities, such as walking, running, and manipulation of objects. Together, these two divisions of the skeletal system play essential roles in protecting internal organs, supporting the body, and enabling mobility.
