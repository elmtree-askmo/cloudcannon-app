    How is blood pressure measured and what are the normal ranges?
answer: >-
    Blood pressure is measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer, which typically consists of an inflatable cuff and a pressure gauge. The measurement is expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is recorded as two numbers: the systolic pressure (the first and higher number) and the diastolic pressure (the second and lower number). For example, a reading of 132/88 mmHg indicates a systolic pressure of 132 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 88 mmHg.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80 mmHg. Here are the classifications of blood pressure according to the AHA:\n\n- **Normal:** Less than 120/80 mmHg\n- **Elevated:** Systolic between 120-129 and diastolic less than 80 mmHg\n- **Hypertension Stage 1:** Systolic between 130-139 or diastolic between 80-89 mmHg\n- **Hypertension Stage 2:** Systolic 140 mmHg or higher or diastolic 90 mmHg or higher\n- **Hypertensive Crisis:** Systolic over 180 and/or diastolic over 120 mmHg (requires immediate medical attention)\n\nBlood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day and can be influenced by various factors, including physical activity, stress, and overall health. Regular monitoring is important, especially for individuals at risk of hypertension or related health issues.
