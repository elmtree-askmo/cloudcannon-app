answer: >-
    Gastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying, is a condition characterized by the slowed passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine. This delay results in food remaining in the stomach for longer than normal, which can lead to a variety of uncomfortable symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms of gastroparesis may include:\n\n- Feeling full shortly after starting a meal\n- Feeling full long after eating a meal\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Excessive bloating\n- Excessive belching\n- Pain in the upper abdomen\n- Heartburn\n- Poor appetite\n\nThese symptoms can significantly impact a person's quality of life and may vary in severity. Gastroparesis can affect individuals of any age and may be associated with underlying conditions, such as diabetes, which can further complicate management and treatment.
