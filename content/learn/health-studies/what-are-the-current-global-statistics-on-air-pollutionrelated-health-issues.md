    What are the current global statistics on air pollution-related health issues?
answer: >-
    Air pollution is a significant global health crisis, with current statistics highlighting its severe impact on public health. According to the latest reports, air pollution is responsible for approximately **8.1 million deaths globally** in 2021, making it the **second leading risk factor for death** worldwide, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as children under five years old. \n\nIn terms of specific health impacts, air pollution contributes to a range of serious health conditions, including:\n\n- **Cardiovascular diseases**\n- **Respiratory diseases**\n- **Lung cancer**\n- **Stroke**\n- **Lower respiratory infections**\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that **9 out of 10 people** worldwide breathe polluted air, which is linked to a reduction in life expectancy. For instance, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been shown to reduce average global life expectancy by approximately **one year and eight months** as of 2021.\n\nIn the United States, a report from the American Lung Association reveals that about **1 in 4 Americans**, or more than **119 million residents**, live in areas with unhealthy air quality. The report also notes that cities with the worst air quality have seen an increase in the number of days residents are exposed to high levels of fine particle pollution, with an average of **18.3 days** in the top 25 cities.\n\nFurthermore, the burden of air pollution-related health issues is disproportionately felt in low- and middle-income countries, where both indoor and outdoor pollution levels tend to be higher due to reliance on solid fuels for cooking and rapid industrialization.\n\nOverall, the statistics underscore the urgent need for effective air quality management and public health interventions to mitigate the health impacts of air pollution globally.
