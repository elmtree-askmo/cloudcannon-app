    What is the recommended daily allowance for protein intake?
answer: >-
    The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein intake varies based on factors such as age, sex, and activity level. For the average sedentary adult, the RDA is set at 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This means that for a person weighing 140 pounds (approximately 63.5 kg), the daily protein requirement would be about 51 grams.\n\nHere are some specific recommendations based on different demographics:\n\n1. **General Adults**: 0.8 g/kg of body weight.\n2. **Older Adults (over age 65)**: 1.2 g/kg of body weight is recommended to help counteract muscle loss.\n3. **Active Individuals and Athletes**: Many experts suggest that those who are physically active may benefit from higher protein intakes, typically ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg, depending on their training intensity and goals.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults should get 10-35% of their daily calories from protein. This flexibility allows individuals to adjust their protein intake based on their overall dietary needs and health goals.\n\nIn summary, while the baseline RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg for most adults, individual needs may vary, and higher intakes may be beneficial for certain populations, particularly those who are older or more physically active.
