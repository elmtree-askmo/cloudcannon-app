    What are the current statistics and trends in drug driving endorsements?
answer: >-
    Current statistics and trends in drug driving endorsements indicate a significant rise in drug-impaired driving incidents, surpassing those related to alcohol. A report from a national policing operation targeting drink and drug driving in the UK revealed that during a six-week period from November 21, 2022, to January 1, 2023, there were 8,713 positive results from tests conducted on drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\nA survey conducted by the road safety charity IAM RoadSmart found that approximately 10% of 2,028 respondents admitted to driving within 24 hours of consuming illegal drugs, which translates to an estimated 3.5 million individuals in the UK. Cannabis was identified as the most commonly used substance, followed by cocaine and ecstasy.\n\nMoreover, police reports indicate a growing trend in drug-impaired driving incidents. In 2022, there were 5,905 reported incidents of drug-impaired driving, while alcohol-impaired driving incidents totaled 57,221, showing a stark contrast in trends where drug-related incidents are on the rise.\n\nIn the United States, drug-involved driving is also a pressing issue, with 25.3% of the 38,824 fatalities in 2020 linked to drug-involved driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has noted that the use of cannabis, prescription drugs, and other substances is increasingly prevalent on roadways.\n\nThese statistics highlight the urgent need for enhanced awareness and legislative measures to address drug driving, as the implications for road safety are significant. The data suggests that drug driving is becoming a more common issue than drink driving, necessitating a reevaluation of current road safety policies and enforcement strategies.
