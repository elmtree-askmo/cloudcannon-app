    What is the lifespan of different blood cells?
answer: >-
    The lifespan of different blood cells varies significantly based on their type:\n\n1. **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)**: The average lifespan of red blood cells is approximately 120 days. They are produced in the bone marrow and are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returning carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation. After their lifespan, red blood cells are typically recycled by the spleen and liver.\n\n2. **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**: Platelets have a much shorter lifespan, living for about 8 to 9 days. They play a crucial role in blood clotting and wound healing.\n\n3. **White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)**: The lifespan of white blood cells varies widely depending on the type. Some white blood cells can live for only a few hours, while others can persist for several years. They are essential components of the immune system, helping to fight infections and respond to foreign invaders.\n\nIn summary, the lifespans of blood cells are as follows:\n- Red Blood Cells: ~120 days\n- Platelets: 8-9 days\n- White Blood Cells: A few hours to several years, depending on the specific type.
