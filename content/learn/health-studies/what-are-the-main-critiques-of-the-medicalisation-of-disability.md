    What are the main critiques of the medicalisation of disability?
answer: >-
    The critiques of the medicalisation of disability are multifaceted and stem from various perspectives within Disability Studies and related fields. Here are the main critiques:\n\n1. **Individualization of Disability**: One of the primary critiques is that medicalisation tends to individualize disability, framing it as a personal issue rather than a social problem. This perspective overlooks the broader social, economic, and political factors that contribute to the experience of disability (Goodley et al., 2022).\n\n2. **Partial and Negative View**: The medical model of disability is criticized for promoting a negative and partial view of disabled individuals. It emphasizes clinical diagnosis and pathologizes disability, which can lead to a limited understanding of the lived experiences of disabled people. This model often fails to account for the social context and the diverse experiences of individuals with disabilities (Smart, 2004).\n\n3. **Stigmatization and Self-Concept**: The dominant medical model can reinforce stigma and negatively impact a disabled person's self-concept. By framing disability primarily as a medical issue, it can perpetuate feelings of inadequacy and deviance among individuals with disabilities (Lemert, 2009).\n\n4. **De-politicization of Disability**: Some critiques highlight that medicalisation can lead to the de-politicization of disability issues. For instance, newer forms of hyper-medicalization may focus on appealing to able-bodied individuals rather than addressing the systemic barriers faced by disabled people (Cawthorn's speech).\n\n5. **Distinction Between Illness and Disability**: Critics argue that the medical model conflates illness with disability, which is inappropriate. Disability should be understood as a distinct experience that is not solely defined by medical conditions or diagnoses (Oliver, 1986).\n\n6. **Expansion of Medicalization**: The ongoing expansion of medicalization, particularly in areas like genomics, raises concerns about the implications for health policy and the understanding of health as primarily an individual and biological phenomenon. This trend can obscure the social determinants of health and disability (Hayes and Hannold).\n\nThese critiques collectively emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of disability that recognizes its social dimensions and challenges the dominance of the medical model in shaping perceptions and policies related to disability.
