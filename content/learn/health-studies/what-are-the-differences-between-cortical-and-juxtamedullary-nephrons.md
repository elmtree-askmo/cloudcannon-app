    What are the differences between cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons?
answer: >-
    Cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons are the two primary types of nephrons found in the kidneys, each with distinct characteristics and functions.\n\n1. **Location**:\n   - **Cortical Nephrons**: These nephrons are primarily located in the outer region of the kidney, known as the cortex. They make up about 85% of all nephrons in the human kidney.\n   - **Juxtamedullary Nephrons**: In contrast, juxtamedullary nephrons are situated closer to the inner region of the kidney, extending into the medulla. They account for approximately 15% of the nephrons.\n\n2. **Loop of Henle**:\n   - **Cortical Nephrons**: They have shorter loops of Henle that do not extend deep into the medulla, primarily remaining within the outer cortex.\n   - **Juxtamedullary Nephrons**: These nephrons possess longer loops of Henle that extend deep into the inner medulla, which is crucial for their function in urine concentration.\n\n3. **Function**:\n   - **Cortical Nephrons**: They are mainly involved in the filtration of blood and the reabsorption of nutrients, playing a significant role in the regulatory and excretory functions of the body.\n   - **Juxtamedullary Nephrons**: Their primary function is to concentrate or dilute urine. The longer loops of Henle allow for a greater reabsorption of water, which is essential for maintaining water balance in the body. This is particularly important for animals in terrestrial environments, such as birds, which have a higher proportion of juxtamedullary nephrons.\n\n4. **Susceptibility to Damage**:\n   - **Cortical Nephrons**: They are more susceptible to damage from high blood pressure due to their location and function.\n   - **Juxtamedullary Nephrons**: These nephrons are generally more resilient to such damage.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons lie in their location, structure (specifically the length of the loop of Henle), and their respective roles in kidney function, with cortical nephrons focusing on filtration and juxtamedullary nephrons specializing in urine concentration.
