    What are the main components of human body composition?
answer: >-
    The human body is composed of various elements and compounds, with a significant focus on the major elements that account for its overall composition. The primary components of human body composition include:\n\n1. **Major Elements**: The four main elements that constitute the majority of the human body are:\n   - **Oxygen (O)**: Approximately 61-65% of the body's mass, primarily found in water (H2O) and organic molecules.\n   - **Hydrogen (H)**: Accounts for about 10% of the body's mass, also predominantly found in water and organic compounds.\n   - **Carbon (C)**: Essential for all organic molecules, carbon makes up about 18% of the body's mass.\n   - **Nitrogen (N)**: Constitutes around 3% of the body's mass, primarily found in amino acids and nucleic acids.\n\n2. **Other Significant Elements**: In addition to the major four, several other elements are crucial for various physiological functions:\n   - **Calcium (Ca)**: Important for bone structure and muscle function.\n   - **Phosphorus (P)**: Vital for energy transfer (as part of ATP) and bone health.\n\n3. **Trace Elements**: The human body contains around 20 different elements, with trace elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and selenium playing critical roles in enzymatic reactions and overall health.\n\n4. **Body Composition Categories**: In terms of physical fitness and health, body composition can be categorized into different compartments, including:\n   - **Fat Mass**: The total mass of fat in the body.\n   - **Lean Mass**: This includes muscle, bone, and water content.\n   - **Water**: Approximately 60% of the human body is composed of water, which is essential for various bodily functions.\n\nUnderstanding these components is crucial for studying human physiology, health, and fitness, as variations in body composition can significantly affect an individual's health and physical performance.
