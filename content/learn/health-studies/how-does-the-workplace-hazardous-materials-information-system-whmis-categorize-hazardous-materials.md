    How does the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) categorize hazardous materials?
answer: >-
    The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) categorizes hazardous materials into specific hazard classes and categories based on their properties. This system was updated in 2015 to align with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). \n\nWHMIS 2015 includes several key components:\n\n1. **Hazard Classification**: This is the process of identifying the hazards associated with a product. Each hazardous product is classified into one of the designated hazard classes, which are further divided into categories that indicate the severity of the hazard. For example, within a specific hazard class, Category 2 is considered more hazardous than Category 3.\n\n2. **Labeling**: Each hazardous product must have a cautionary label that includes symbols and information about the hazards associated with the product. This labeling is standardized to ensure consistency and clarity.\n\n3. **Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)**: These documents provide detailed information about the hazardous product, including its properties, handling instructions, and emergency measures.\n\n4. **Worker Education and Training**: Employers are required to provide training to workers about the hazards of the materials they may encounter in the workplace, as well as how to read labels and SDSs.\n\nThe WHMIS hazard classes include categories such as:\n- Physical hazards (e.g., flammable gases, explosives)\n- Health hazards (e.g., carcinogenicity, respiratory sensitization)\n- Environmental hazards (e.g., aquatic toxicity)\n\nBy categorizing hazardous materials in this way, WHMIS aims to enhance safety in the workplace by ensuring that workers are informed about the risks associated with the materials they handle and how to protect themselves effectively.
