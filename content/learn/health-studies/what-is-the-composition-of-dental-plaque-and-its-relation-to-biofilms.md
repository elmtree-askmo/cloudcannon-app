    What is the composition of dental plaque and its relation to biofilms?
answer: >-
    Dental plaque is a complex biofilm that forms on tooth surfaces, restorations, and prosthetic appliances. It is characterized by a structured architecture and a diverse microbial composition, which includes a significant proportion of unculturable bacteria. The composition of dental plaque is dynamic and can vary between healthy and diseased states, with the microbial community in health remaining relatively stable over time, a phenomenon known as microbial homeostasis.\n\nThe biofilm is embedded in a matrix of polymers derived from both host and bacterial origins, which contributes to its structural integrity. This extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in protecting the microbial community from antimicrobial agents, making biofilms generally more resistant to treatment compared to planktonic (free-floating) bacteria. The interactions within the biofilm community can lead to enhanced pathogenicity, a phenomenon referred to as pathogenic synergism, where the collective behavior of the microbial community can result in more severe disease outcomes.\n\nThe formation of dental plaque is initiated by the acquisition of a pellicle, a layer of glycoproteins from saliva that coats the tooth surface shortly after cleaning. This pellicle serves as a substrate for bacterial adhesion and colonization. The community structure of dental plaque is influenced by specific inter-taxon physical and chemical interactions, which help to establish a stable biofilm environment.\n\nIn summary, dental plaque is a well-organized biofilm with a diverse microbial community that plays a significant role in oral health and disease. Understanding its composition and structure is essential for developing effective strategies for plaque control and management of oral diseases.
