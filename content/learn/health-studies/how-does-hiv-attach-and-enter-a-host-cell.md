    How does HIV attach and enter a host cell?
answer: >-
    HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) attaches to and enters host cells through a complex and highly coordinated process that primarily involves its envelope proteins, specifically gp120 and gp41. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how this process occurs:\n\n1. **Initial Attachment**: The entry of HIV into host cells begins with the binding of the viral envelope protein (Env) to the primary cellular receptor CD4, which is predominantly found on the surface of CD4+ T cells. This initial interaction is crucial as it determines the viral tropism, or the specific types of cells that the virus can infect.\n\n2. **Coreceptor Binding**: Following the binding to CD4, the gp120 subunit of the Env protein undergoes a conformational change that allows it to interact with a coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4. This step is essential for the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.\n\n3. **Membrane Fusion**: The binding of gp120 to both CD4 and the coreceptor triggers the gp41 subunit to facilitate the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. This fusion process allows the viral RNA and associated proteins to enter the host cell cytoplasm.\n\n4. **Utilization of Host Cell Machinery**: Recent studies suggest that HIV may also exploit cellular transport pathways to enhance the efficiency of its entry. This involves relocalization to specific sites on the host cell where membrane fusion can occur, promoting infection at what is referred to as the "infectious synapse."\n\n5. **Delivery of Viral Genome**: Once the membranes have fused, the viral capsid, which contains the viral RNA and proteins, is released into the host cell. This marks the beginning of the HIV replication cycle, where the viral genome is reverse transcribed and integrated into the host's DNA.\n\nThis multi-step process highlights the intricate mechanisms HIV employs to successfully infect host cells, which is critical for its ability to replicate and ultimately compromise the human immune system. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing effective treatments and prevention strategies against HIV.
