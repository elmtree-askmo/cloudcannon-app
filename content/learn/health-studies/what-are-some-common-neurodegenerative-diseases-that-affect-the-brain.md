    What are some common neurodegenerative diseases that affect the brain?
answer: >-
    Common neurodegenerative diseases that affect the brain include:\n\n1. **Alzheimer's Disease**: This is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical structures. It leads to significant atrophy of the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex. As of 2022, approximately 6.2 million people in the United States are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2. **Parkinson's Disease**: This is another common neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.\n\n3. **Lou Gehrig's Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - ALS)**: This condition affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, disability, and eventually death.\n\n4. **Dementia**: This term encompasses a range of conditions, including vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia, which involve the decline of cognitive function due to the death of nerve cells in the brain.\n\n5. **Corticobasal Degeneration**: This is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects movement and cognition, often leading to symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of specific groups of neurons, which can result from various factors, including oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. These diseases significantly impact millions of people worldwide, affecting not only cognitive functions but also other physiological processes.
