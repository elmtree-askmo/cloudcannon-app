    How is plasma different from formed elements in blood?
answer: >-
    Plasma and formed elements are the two main components of blood, each serving distinct functions.\n\n**Plasma** is the liquid extracellular matrix of blood, making up approximately 55% of its total volume. It is a straw-colored fluid that contains a variety of dissolved substances, including:\n\n- **Proteins**: Such as albumin (which accounts for about 54% of plasma proteins), globulins (approximately 38%), and fibrinogen, which are essential for various physiological functions including maintaining osmotic pressure, immune responses, and blood clotting.\n- **Ions**: Such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and bicarbonate, which are crucial for maintaining pH and electrolyte balance.\n- **Nutrients**: Including glucose, amino acids, and lipids, which provide energy and building blocks for cells.\n- **Hormones and Metabolites**: These are involved in regulating various bodily functions.\n- **Clotting Factors**: Essential for the coagulation process.\n\nIn contrast, the **formed elements** of blood are the cellular components, which include:\n\n- **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**: Also known as erythrocytes, these cells are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returning carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.\n- **White Blood Cells (WBCs)**: Also known as leukocytes, these cells are part of the immune system and help defend the body against infections and foreign invaders.\n- **Platelets**: These are cell fragments that play a critical role in blood clotting and wound healing.\n\nIn summary, plasma serves as the fluid medium that carries the formed elements and various solutes, while the formed elements consist of the cellular components that perform specific functions in oxygen transport, immune response, and clotting. Together, they make blood a unique connective tissue essential for sustaining life.
