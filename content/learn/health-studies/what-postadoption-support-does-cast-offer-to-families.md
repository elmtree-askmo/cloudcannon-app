    What post-adoption support does CAST offer to families?
answer: >-
    The Children's Aid Society of Toronto (CAST) offers a range of post-adoption support services to families who have adopted children or youth. These services are designed to assist adoptive parents in navigating the unique challenges that can arise after adoption. Here are the key components of the post-adoption support provided by CAST:\n\n1. **Access to Resources**: Adoptive families receive information and access to various community services that can help support the needs of their adopted child or youth.\n\n2. **Financial Assistance**: In some circumstances, CAST provides adoption subsidies to help families manage the financial aspects of raising an adopted child.\n\n3. **Support from Post-Adoption Workers**: Families can receive assistance from dedicated Post-Adoption Workers who offer clinical guidance and expertise. These professionals support adoptive parents throughout their journey, providing valuable insights and resources.\n\n4. **Ongoing Support Until Age 18**: The post-adoption support services are accessible until the adopted child or youth reaches the age of 18, ensuring that families have long-term assistance as needed.\n\n5. **Community Referrals and Advocacy**: While CAST does not provide direct therapeutic services, they can assist families with information and referrals to community resources, as well as advocate for the needs of adoptive families.\n\nOverall, CAST is committed to supporting adoptive families by providing them with the necessary tools and resources to foster a successful and healthy family dynamic post-adoption.
