    What is the current status of the suspected Mpox case in India?
answer: >-
    As of now, India has reported a suspected case of Mpox involving a young male patient who recently returned from a country with active Mpox transmission. This case is significant as it marks the first suspected instance in the current outbreak, which has raised public health concerns due to the emergence of the clade 1b strain, known for being more infectious and deadlier compared to the older clade 2 strain that previously circulated in the country.\n\nThe Union Health Ministry has confirmed that the suspected case is isolated and the individual is currently being treated at a designated tertiary care isolation facility. This case follows a history of over 30 confirmed Mpox cases in India since 2022, with one reported death. The recent developments have prompted health authorities to enhance surveillance and response measures, particularly at international airports and ports of entry.\n\nIt is important to note that while this suspected case has been identified, there are currently no confirmed cases of Mpox in India as of the latest updates. The situation is being closely monitored by health officials, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has revised its alerts and protocols in light of the new strain's emergence.
