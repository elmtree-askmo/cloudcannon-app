    What are the survival rates for different types of liver cancer?
answer: >-
    The survival rates for different types of liver cancer can vary significantly based on the type of cancer, stage at diagnosis, and other factors. Here is an overview of the survival rates for the most common types of liver cancer:\n\n1. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**:\n   - The five-year survival rate for localized HCC (when the cancer is confined to the liver) is approximately **33%**. \n   - For patients diagnosed with HCC at a localized stage, the survival rate can be around **37%**.\n   - Overall, the five-year survival rate for HCC is reported to be about **18%**, making it one of the deadliest forms of liver cancer.\n\n2. **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer):\n   - The five-year survival rate for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (cancer starting within the liver) is about **24%** when diagnosed at a localized stage.\n   - However, the overall prognosis for cholangiocarcinoma is poor, with a five-year survival rate of only **9%** for patients with this type of cancer.\n\n3. **Metastatic Liver Cancer**:\n   - The survival rates for metastatic liver cancer (cancer that has spread to the liver from other parts of the body) are generally lower, but specific statistics can vary widely based on the primary cancer type and other individual factors.\n\nThese survival rates are based on data collected from various studies and cancer registries, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. It's important to note that these rates are averages and individual prognosis can vary based on numerous factors, including the patient's overall health, response to treatment, and advancements in medical care.
