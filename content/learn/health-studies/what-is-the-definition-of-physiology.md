    What is the definition of physiology?
answer: >-
    Physiology is defined as the scientific study of the functions and mechanisms in living systems. It focuses on how organisms, organ systems, individual organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out their chemical and physical functions. Essentially, physiology examines the ways in which the bodies of living things work, encompassing a wide range of topics including the physical and chemical processes that occur within living organisms.\n\nAs a branch of biology, physiology is closely related to anatomy, which is the study of the structure and identity of body parts. While anatomy provides insight into the organization and interrelationship of body parts, physiology explains how these parts function and interact to maintain life. This includes understanding processes such as respiration, digestion, and the body's ability to maintain homeostasis, which is the stable internal environment necessary for survival.\n\nIn summary, physiology is a dynamic discipline that not only underpins the medical and biological sciences but also serves as a bridge between the physical sciences and life sciences, exploring every aspect of how living organisms operate.
