    What is the recommended intake of fats for a balanced diet?
answer: >-
    The recommended intake of fats for a balanced diet varies based on total daily calorie consumption. According to dietary guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), adults should aim for a daily fat intake that constitutes between 20% and 35% of their total daily calories. \n\nFor example, in a standard 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to approximately 400 to 700 calories from fat per day. Since each gram of fat contains about nine calories, this equates to a daily fat intake of about 44 to 78 grams.\n\nIt's also important to consider the types of fats consumed. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to no more than 6% of total daily calories, particularly for individuals looking to lower their cholesterol levels. This means that for a 2,000-calorie diet, the maximum recommended intake of saturated fat would be around 120 calories, or approximately 13 grams.\n\nIn summary, for a balanced diet, the recommended fat intake is:\n- 20% to 35% of total daily calories\n- Approximately 44 to 78 grams of fat per day for a 2,000-calorie diet\n- Limit saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories for heart health. \n\nIncorporating healthy fats, such as those from plant sources (e.g., olive oil, nuts, and avocados), while minimizing saturated and trans fats, is essential for maintaining overall health.
