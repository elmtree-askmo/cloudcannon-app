    What are the genetic causes of classic galactosemia?
answer: >-
    Classic galactosemia is primarily caused by genetic mutations in the GALT gene, which is located on chromosome 9. This gene encodes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), which is essential for the metabolism of galactose, a sugar found in milk and other foods. In individuals with classic galactosemia, mutations in the GALT gene result in absent or misfolded forms of the enzyme, leading to severely diminished enzymatic activity. As a consequence, galactose and its metabolites accumulate in the body, causing damage to various cells, including neurons and hepatocytes.\n\nThe inheritance pattern of classic galactosemia is autosomal recessive, meaning that an affected individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene—one from each parent—who are typically carriers of the mutation. Over 300 different pathogenic variants of the GALT gene have been identified, with the most common variant among individuals of European ancestry being the NM_000155.4:c mutation.\n\nIf not treated promptly with a low-galactose diet, infants with classic galactosemia can develop life-threatening complications shortly after birth. Early diagnosis through newborn screening is crucial for preventing these severe outcomes.
