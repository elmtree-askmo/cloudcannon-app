    How are occupational diseases classified in Hong Kong?
answer: >-
    In Hong Kong, occupational diseases are classified under specific legislation, primarily the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO), the Occupational Deafness (Compensation) Ordinance (ODCO), and the Pneumoconiosis and Mesothelioma (Compensation) Ordinance. As of now, there are a total of 52 occupational diseases prescribed under these ordinances. This number has increased from 21 since the first list was established in 1953, reflecting ongoing revisions to address emerging health concerns in the workplace.\n\nThe Labour Department of Hong Kong employs four major criteria to determine whether a disease should be classified as an occupational disease under the relevant ordinances. These criteria include:\n\n1. **Occupational Origin**: The disease must have a reasonable presumption of being caused by the worker's occupation.\n2. **Medical Evidence**: There should be sufficient medical evidence linking the disease to the occupational exposure.\n3. **Prevalence**: The disease should be prevalent in certain occupations or industries.\n4. **Preventability**: There should be measures that can be taken to prevent the disease in the workplace.\n\nAdditionally, certain diseases are categorized as "notifiable occupational diseases," which require medical practitioners to report cases to the Commissioner for Labour. This classification helps in monitoring and managing occupational health risks effectively.\n\nFor further details, the Labour Department provides resources, including the "Guidance Notes on the Diagnosis of Notifiable Occupational Diseases," which outlines the specific diseases and related occupations.
