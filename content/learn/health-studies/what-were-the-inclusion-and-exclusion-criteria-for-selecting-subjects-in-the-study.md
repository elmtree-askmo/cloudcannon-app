answer: >-
    In the study regarding anaerobic capacity measurement, specifically focusing on the Maximal Accumulated Oxygen Deficit (MAOD) and tethered running test methodology, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting subjects were as follows:\n\n### Inclusion Criteria:\n1. **Training Frequency**: Participants were required to have a weekly training routine of at least three times per week.\n2. **Maximal Oxygen Uptake (VO2max)**: Subjects needed to have a VO2max higher than 50 mL/kg/min, which was assessed through a graded exercise test.\n3. **Intensity at VO2max (iVO2max)**: Participants had to demonstrate an intensity at VO2max of at least 15 km/h.\n\n### Exclusion Criteria:\n1. **Age**: Only male adult participants aged 18 years and older were included in the study.\n2. **Health Conditions**: Individuals with any health conditions that could affect their performance or safety during the tests were likely excluded, although specific conditions were not detailed in the gathered information.\n\nThese criteria were established to ensure that the study population was homogenous in terms of fitness level and training background, which is crucial for the validity of the research findings. The systematic application of these criteria helps to minimize bias and enhances the reliability of the results obtained from the study.
