    What are the key stages in embryo development?
answer: >-
    Embryonic development, also known as embryogenesis, is a complex process that transforms a single-celled zygote into a multicellular embryo. The key stages of embryonic development can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Fertilization**: This is the initial stage where a sperm cell fuses with an egg cell (ovum) to form a zygote. This process typically occurs in the fallopian tube.\n\n2. **Cleavage**: After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of rapid cell divisions known as cleavage, resulting in a multicellular structure called a morula.\n\n3. **Blastocyst Formation**: The morula develops into a blastocyst, which consists of an inner cell mass (that will become the embryo) and an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast (which will contribute to the placenta). This stage is crucial for implantation into the uterine wall.\n\n4. **Implantation**: The blastocyst implants itself into the uterine lining, establishing a connection for nutrient exchange and waste removal between the mother and the developing embryo.\n\n5. **Gastrulation**: This stage involves the formation of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These layers will differentiate into various tissues and organs.\n\n6. **Neurulation**: Following gastrulation, the neural tube forms from the ectoderm, which will eventually develop into the central nervous system.\n\n7. **Organogenesis**: This is the period during which most internal organs and external body structures begin to form. It occurs primarily during weeks 3 to 8 of embryonic development. Key developments include the formation of the heart and major blood vessels, which begin to develop around 16 days after fertilization.\n\n8. **Embryonic Stage**: The developing human is referred to as an embryo during weeks 3 to 8. During this time, significant morphological changes occur, and the embryo continues to grow and differentiate.\n\n9. **Transition to Fetus**: After the eighth week of gestation, the developing human is referred to as a fetus, marking the transition from the embryonic stage to fetal development, which continues until birth.\n\nThese stages are critical for the proper development of the embryo and the establishment of a healthy pregnancy. Each stage is characterized by specific developmental milestones that are essential for the formation of a viable organism.
