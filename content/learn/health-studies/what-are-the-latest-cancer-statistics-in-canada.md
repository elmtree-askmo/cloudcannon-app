    What are the latest cancer statistics in Canada?
answer: >-
    The latest cancer statistics in Canada were released in the Canadian Cancer Statistics 2023 report on November 8, 2023. This report, produced through a collaboration between the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada, and the Public Health Agency of Canada, provides comprehensive data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival estimates.\n\nKey highlights from the 2023 report include:\n\n- An estimated **239,100 new cancer diagnoses** are expected in Canada for the year 2023, which marks an increase from the **233,900** cases reported in 2022.\n- The report also anticipates approximately **86,700 cancer-related deaths** in Canada for the same year.\n- Notably, there has been a significant decline in cancer mortality rates across all types, with the fastest decline observed in lung cancer mortality.\n- The report emphasizes the progress made in preventing lung cancer, advancing early detection, and improving treatment options for patients.\n\nThe Canadian Cancer Statistics publication is a vital resource that provides detailed information on cancer trends, including incidence and mortality rates by sex, age group, and geographic region for over 20 different types of cancer. This data is crucial for understanding the burden of cancer in Canada and directing future advocacy and support initiatives.\n\nFor more detailed statistics and insights, the full report can be accessed through the Canadian Cancer Society's website at cancer.ca/statistics.
