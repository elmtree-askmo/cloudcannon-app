    How does the study address the variability in individual anaerobic capacity?
answer: >-
    The study addresses the variability in individual anaerobic capacity (AnC) by examining several factors that contribute to this variability among participants. One significant finding is the genetic diversity among the participants, as indicated by the distribution of genotypes (49% AA, 43% AC, and 8% CC). This genetic variation can explain the inter-individual differences in performance and anaerobic capacity, particularly in response to interventions such as caffeine, where the change in anaerobic capacity ranged from âˆ’24.5% to 34.2% among individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlights the importance of different methodologies for measuring anaerobic capacity, specifically comparing the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) method with other approaches like the gross energy cost (GEC) method. The variability in individual responses to these methods is further emphasized by the differences in Y-intercept values for the MAOD regression, which can lead to different estimates of anaerobic capacity.\n\nThe study also notes that the lowest within-subject variability in the variables assessed suggests that certain field tests, such as the AST70, are valid for measuring anaerobic capacity in specific populations, like athletes with cystic fibrosis (CF). This indicates that the choice of testing methodology can influence the assessment of anaerobic capacity and its variability among individuals.\n\nIn summary, the study addresses individual variability in anaerobic capacity through genetic factors, methodological differences in testing, and the validation of specific field tests, all of which contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how anaerobic capacity can differ from one individual to another.
