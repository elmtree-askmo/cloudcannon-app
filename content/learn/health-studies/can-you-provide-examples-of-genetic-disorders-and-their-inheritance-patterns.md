answer: >-
    Genetic disorders are diseases caused by abnormalities in an individual's DNA, which can be inherited from one or both parents. These disorders can follow various inheritance patterns, primarily categorized as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, and mitochondrial inheritance. Here are some examples of genetic disorders along with their inheritance patterns:\n\n### 1. Autosomal Dominant\nIn autosomal dominant disorders, only one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the altered gene to each child.\n\n- **Examples**: \n  - **Huntington's Disease**: A neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline.\n  - **Marfan Syndrome**: A connective tissue disorder that affects the skeletal system, cardiovascular system, and eyes.\n\n### 2. Autosomal Recessive\nIn autosomal recessive disorders, two copies of the altered gene (one from each parent) are necessary for the disorder to manifest. Parents may be carriers without showing symptoms.\n\n- **Examples**: \n  - **Cystic Fibrosis**: A disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems due to thick mucus production.\n  - **Sickle Cell Anemia**: A blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to distorted red blood cells.\n\n### 3. X-Linked Dominant\nIn X-linked dominant disorders, the defective gene is located on the X chromosome. Both males and females can be affected, but males are often more severely affected.\n\n- **Examples**: \n  - **Fragile X Syndrome**: A genetic condition causing intellectual disability and developmental delays.\n  - **Rett Syndrome**: A neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and leads to severe cognitive and physical impairments.\n\n### 4. X-Linked Recessive\nIn X-linked recessive disorders, the defective gene is also located on the X chromosome, but typically affects males more severely, as they have only one X chromosome.\n\n- **Examples**: \n  - **Hemophilia**: A bleeding disorder where blood does not clot properly due to a deficiency in clotting factors.\n  - **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**: A severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys, leading to muscle degeneration and weakness.\n\n### 5. Mitochondrial Inheritance\nMitochondrial disorders are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA and are passed from mother to offspring.\n\n- **Examples**: \n  - **Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)**: A condition that can lead to sudden vision loss due to optic nerve damage.\n  - **Mitochondrial Myopathy**: A group of disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, affecting muscle function.\n\nThese examples illustrate the diversity of genetic disorders and their inheritance patterns, highlighting the complexity of genetic transmission and expression in humans. Understanding these patterns is crucial for genetic counseling and risk assessment in families.
