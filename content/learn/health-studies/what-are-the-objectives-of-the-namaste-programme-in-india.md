    What are the objectives of the NAMASTE Programme in India?
answer: >-
    The NAMASTE Programme, which stands for National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem, is a significant initiative launched in India to enhance the safety and dignity of sanitation workers. The programme is a joint effort by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Here are the key objectives of the NAMASTE Programme:\n\n1. **Achieving Zero Fatalities**: One of the primary goals of NAMASTE is to eliminate fatalities associated with sanitation work, particularly in the context of sewer and septic tank cleaning.\n\n2. **Skilled Workforce**: The programme aims to ensure that all sanitation work is performed by skilled workers, thereby enhancing the quality of sanitation services and the safety of the workers involved.\n\n3. **Preventing Direct Contact with Human Waste**: NAMASTE seeks to prevent sanitation workers from coming into direct contact with human fecal matter, which poses significant health risks.\n\n4. **Formalization and Institutionalization**: The initiative aims to formalize and institutionalize the sanitation workforce in urban areas, including those employed by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), parastatal agencies, private sanitation service organizations, and independent workers.\n\n5. **Recognition of Sanitation Workers**: NAMASTE emphasizes the importance of recognizing sanitation workers as key contributors to the operations and maintenance of sanitation infrastructure, thereby promoting their rights and dignity.\n\n6. **Support for Wastepickers**: Since 2024, the programme has also included wastepickers, acknowledging their role in the sanitation ecosystem and providing them with necessary support.\n\n7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The scheme aims to cover all 4800+ ULBs across India, ensuring a wide-reaching impact on urban sanitation practices.\n\nWith an outlay of Rs. 349.70 crore, the NAMASTE Programme represents a significant step towards improving the working conditions and safety of sanitation workers in India, while also addressing the broader issues of manual scavenging and sanitation management.
