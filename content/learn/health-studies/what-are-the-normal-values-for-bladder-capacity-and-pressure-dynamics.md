    What are the normal values for bladder capacity and pressure dynamics?
answer: >-
    The normal values for bladder capacity and pressure dynamics are as follows:\n\n1. **Bladder Capacity**: In adults, the typical bladder capacity ranges from **300 to 600 mL**. This is the volume of urine that the bladder can comfortably hold before the urge to void is felt.\n\n2. **Bladder Compliance**: Normal bladder compliance values range from **12.5 to 40 mL/cm H2O**. Compliance is a measure of how much the bladder can expand in volume for a given increase in pressure. Values below 12.5 mL/cm H2O indicate a loss of compliance, which means that even small increases in urine volume can lead to significant increases in bladder pressure, potentially resulting in symptoms such as urinary frequency and incontinence.\n\n3. **Pressure Dynamics**: During the storage phase, normal bladder function is characterized by **low intravesical pressure**. This allows the bladder to store urine without significant pressure increases. When the bladder contracts during voiding, the pressure increases to facilitate the expulsion of urine. Abnormal patterns may include elevated bladder pressures during storage, which can indicate reduced compliance, or low flow rates during voiding, suggesting potential obstruction.\n\nIn summary, normal bladder function is characterized by a capacity of 300-600 mL, compliance values of 12.5-40 mL/cm H2O, and low pressure during the storage phase with increased pressure during voiding. These parameters are crucial for assessing bladder health and diagnosing conditions related to urinary incontinence and other bladder dysfunctions.
