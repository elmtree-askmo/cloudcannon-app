    How are Paramedical Practitioners defined in the classification?
answer: >-
    Paramedical practitioners are classified under the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08) within Group 2240. This classification defines paramedical practitioners as professionals who provide advisory, diagnostic, curative, and preventive medical services that are more limited in scope and complexity compared to those performed by medical doctors. They typically work autonomously or with limited supervision from medical doctors and are trained to apply advanced clinical procedures for the treatment and prevention of diseases and injuries.\n\nThe ISCO-08 categorizes paramedical practitioners into a minor group, which includes various roles such as surgical technicians and feldshers. These practitioners play a crucial role in the healthcare system by supporting medical doctors and enhancing the overall delivery of health services.\n\nIn summary, paramedical practitioners are essential healthcare providers classified under ISCO-08 Group 2240, recognized for their specialized skills in delivering medical services that complement the work of physicians.
