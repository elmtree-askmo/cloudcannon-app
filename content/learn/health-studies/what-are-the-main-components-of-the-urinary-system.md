    What are the main components of the urinary system?
answer: >-
    The urinary system, also known as the renal system, is a crucial part of the human body responsible for the production, storage, and elimination of urine. It consists of four main components:\n\n1. **Kidneys**: The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located along the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity. They filter blood to remove waste products and excess substances, producing urine in the process. The kidneys also play a vital role in regulating the body's fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and blood pressure.\n\n2. **Ureters**: These are muscular tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. Each kidney has its own ureter, which carries urine through peristaltic movements.\n\n3. **Urinary Bladder**: The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that serves as a temporary reservoir for urine. It can expand to hold varying amounts of urine and contracts to expel urine during urination.\n\n4. **Urethra**: The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. In males, the urethra is longer as it also serves as a passage for semen, while in females, it is shorter and solely functions in urination.\n\nThe primary functions of the urinary system include filtering waste products from the blood, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pH. This system is essential for homeostasis and overall health.
