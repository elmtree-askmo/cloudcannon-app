    How does the body maintain pH levels within a narrow range?
answer: >-
    The human body maintains pH levels within a narrow range, specifically between 7.35 and 7.45, through several mechanisms that ensure proper physiological function. This regulation is crucial because even minor deviations from this range can lead to severe health implications.\n\n1. **Buffer Systems**: The body employs various buffering systems that can quickly neutralize excess acids or bases. These chemical buffers in the blood can make adjustments to pH within seconds. For example, bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) acts as a primary buffer in the blood, helping to maintain pH by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions (H⁺).\n\n2. **Respiratory Regulation**: The respiratory system plays a significant role in pH regulation by controlling the levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the blood. When CO₂ levels rise, it combines with water to form carbonic acid, which can lower pH. Conversely, the removal of CO₂ through exhalation reduces carbonic acid levels, thereby increasing pH. This process allows for rapid adjustments to pH in response to metabolic changes.\n\n3. **Renal Regulation**: The kidneys also contribute to pH balance by excreting or reabsorbing acids and bases. They can excrete hydrogen ions and reabsorb bicarbonate from urine, which helps to correct any imbalances in pH over a longer time frame compared to the respiratory system.\n\n4. **Acid-Base Homeostasis**: The overall process of maintaining acid-base balance is known as acid-base homeostasis. This involves a complex interplay between the buffering systems, respiratory function, and renal function to ensure that the pH of extracellular fluid remains stable.\n\nIn summary, the body utilizes a combination of chemical buffers, respiratory adjustments, and renal functions to maintain pH levels within a narrow range, which is essential for optimal cellular metabolism and overall health.
