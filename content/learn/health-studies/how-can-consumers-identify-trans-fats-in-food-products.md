    How can consumers identify trans fats in food products?
answer: >-
    Consumers can identify trans fats in food products primarily by checking the Nutrition Facts label on the packaging. Since 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required food manufacturers to list the amount of trans fats per serving on these labels. Here are some key points to consider when looking for trans fats:\n\n1. **Nutrition Label**: Look for the trans fat content listed in grams on the Nutrition Facts label. If a product contains more than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, it must be explicitly stated.\n\n2. **Claims on Packaging**: Be cautious of products that claim to be "trans fat-free" or "no trans fats." These claims are valid if the product contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. Therefore, even if a product is labeled as such, it may still contain a small amount of trans fat.\n\n3. **Ingredients List**: Check the ingredients list for "partially hydrogenated oils," which are a primary source of artificial trans fats. If this ingredient is present, the product likely contains trans fats, regardless of what the Nutrition Facts label states.\n\n4. **Serving Size**: Pay attention to the serving size indicated on the label. If you consume more than the stated serving size, you may be ingesting more trans fats than the label suggests.\n\n5. **Common Foods**: Be aware that trans fats are often found in processed foods such as baked goods (cookies, cakes, pies), fried foods, and some margarines. \n\nBy following these guidelines, consumers can make more informed choices and reduce their intake of trans fats, which are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
