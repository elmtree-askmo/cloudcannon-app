    How do neurons differ from glial cells in structure and function?
answer: >-
    Neurons and glial cells are two fundamental types of cells in the nervous system, each with distinct structures and functions.\n\n### Structure\n\n1. **Neurons**:\n   - Neurons are the primary functional units of the nervous system. They have a unique structure that consists of three main parts:\n     - **Dendrites**: These are branching extensions that receive signals from other neurons.\n     - **Cell Body (Soma)**: This contains the nucleus and organelles, maintaining the neuron's structure and providing energy. It integrates incoming signals and generates outgoing signals to the axon.\n     - **Axon**: This long, slender projection transmits electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons or muscles. Some axons are covered with a myelin sheath, which is produced by glial cells, enhancing the speed of signal transmission.\n\n2. **Glial Cells**:\n   - Glial cells, or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells that support and protect neurons. They vary in structure depending on their specific type, but many have a star-like shape with branching processes. Unlike neurons, glial cells can divide by mitosis even after differentiation, allowing them to proliferate in response to injury or disease.\n\n### Function\n\n1. **Neurons**:\n   - Neurons are electrically excitable cells responsible for transmitting nerve impulses throughout the nervous system. They facilitate communication between the central nervous system and the rest of the body, enabling sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive functions.\n\n2. **Glial Cells**:\n   - Glial cells play several supportive roles, including:\n     - **Maintaining Homeostasis**: They help regulate the extracellular environment, ensuring optimal conditions for neuronal function.\n     - **Providing Structural Support**: Glial cells help maintain the architecture of the nervous system.\n     - **Myelination**: Oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system) and Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) produce the myelin sheath that insulates axons, facilitating faster signal transmission.\n     - **Immune Defense**: Microglia act as the immune cells of the central nervous system, responding to injury and disease.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the main differences between neurons and glial cells lie in their structure and function. Neurons are specialized for signal transmission and communication, while glial cells provide essential support, protection, and maintenance for neurons, playing a crucial role in the overall functioning of the nervous system.
