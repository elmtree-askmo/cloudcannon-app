    In the Fiji Year 8 Examination, diet and lifestyle factors are assessed through various components of the Healthy Living curriculum. The examination typically includes multiple-choice questions and structured questions that cover a range of topics related to health education, including nutrition, physical activity, and overall lifestyle choices.\n\n1. **Multiple-Choice Questions**: These questions often focus on key concepts related to healthy eating, the importance of physical activity, and the impact of lifestyle choices on health. Students may be asked to identify healthy food options, understand dietary guidelines, and recognize the benefits of maintaining an active lifestyle.\n\n2. **Structured Questions**: These sections require students to provide more detailed responses, demonstrating their understanding of how diet and lifestyle choices affect health. For example, students might be asked to explain the relationship between diet and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or to discuss strategies for promoting healthy living within their communities.\n\n3. **Critical Thinking**: The examination encourages critical thinking by asking students to analyze scenarios related to diet and lifestyle. For instance, they may be presented with case studies that require them to evaluate the health implications of certain dietary habits or lifestyle choices.\n\n4. **Importance of Health Education**: The assessment emphasizes the significance of health education in fostering awareness about the impact of diet and lifestyle on overall well-being. This includes understanding the role of nutrition in preventing diseases and promoting mental health.\n\nOverall, the assessment of diet and lifestyle factors in the Fiji Year 8 Examination is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed health choices, thereby contributing to their personal well-being and that of their communities.
