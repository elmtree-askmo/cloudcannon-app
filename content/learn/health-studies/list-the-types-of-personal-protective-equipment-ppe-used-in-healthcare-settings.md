answer: >-
    In healthcare settings, personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial for protecting healthcare workers from exposure to infectious agents. The types of PPE commonly used include:\n\n1. **Gloves**: Made from materials such as latex, vinyl, or nitrile, gloves protect the hands from contamination and prevent the transmission of pathogens during patient care.\n\n2. **Gowns**: These are worn to protect the skin and clothing from exposure to blood, bodily fluids, and other potentially infectious materials. Gowns can be disposable or reusable.\n\n3. **Masks**: Surgical masks or N95 respirators are used to protect the respiratory system from airborne pathogens. N95 masks provide a higher level of filtration and are used in situations where there is a risk of airborne transmission.\n\n4. **Eye Protection**: This includes goggles and face shields that protect the eyes from splashes and sprays of infectious materials.\n\n5. **Shoe Covers**: These are used to protect footwear from contamination, especially in environments where there is a risk of exposure to infectious agents.\n\n6. **Head Covers**: In certain situations, head covers may be used to prevent contamination of hair and scalp.\n\n7. **Respirators**: In addition to masks, specialized respirators may be used in high-risk situations to provide a higher level of protection against airborne pathogens.\n\nProper use and disposal of PPE are essential to prevent the transmission of infections, and healthcare workers must be trained in the appropriate protocols for donning and doffing PPE.
