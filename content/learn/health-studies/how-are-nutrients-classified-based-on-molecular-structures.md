    How are nutrients classified based on molecular structures?
answer: >-
    Nutrients can be classified based on their molecular structures into two main categories: macronutrients and micronutrients. \n\n1. **Macronutrients**: These are nutrients required by the body in larger amounts and include:\n   - **Carbohydrates**: These are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They can be further classified into:\n     - **Simple Carbohydrates**: Often referred to as simple sugars, these include glucose and fructose.\n     - **Complex Carbohydrates**: These include starches, fibers, and glycogen, which are made up of longer chains of sugar molecules.\n   - **Proteins**: Composed of amino acids, proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues. They are made up of long chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.\n   - **Lipids (Fats)**: These are primarily triglycerides, which consist of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. Lipids are important for energy storage and cellular structure.\n   - **Water**: Although it does not provide energy, water is essential for various biochemical processes in the body.\n\n2. **Micronutrients**: These are nutrients required in smaller amounts and include:\n   - **Vitamins**: Organic compounds that are crucial for various metabolic processes. They do not provide energy but are essential for the proper functioning of enzymes and other biological processes.\n   - **Minerals**: Inorganic elements that play key roles in bodily functions, such as bone formation, nerve transmission, and muscle contraction.\n\nIn summary, nutrients are classified based on their molecular structures into macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Each class serves distinct functions and is vital for maintaining health and supporting bodily functions.
