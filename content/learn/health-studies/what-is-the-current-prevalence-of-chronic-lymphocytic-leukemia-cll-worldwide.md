    What is the current prevalence of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) worldwide?
answer: >-
    Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent type of leukemia in the Western hemisphere, accounting for approximately 25% to 35% of all leukemia cases in the United States. The global prevalence of CLL has been increasing, with the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) rising by 0.46% per year from 1990 to 2017. This trend indicates that more than 85% of countries have experienced an increase in the ASIR of CLL during this period.\n\nIn the United States, it is estimated that about 20,700 new cases of CLL will be diagnosed in 2024, with approximately 4,440 deaths expected from the disease. CLL accounts for about 1 in 3 new cases of leukemia in the U.S. and represents about 1% of all cancers overall. The incidence rate of CLL is approximately 4.5 per 100,000 men and women per year, with a slightly higher prevalence in men compared to women.\n\nGlobally, leukemia, including CLL, accounted for approximately 2.5% of all new cancer incidences and 3.1% of cancer-related mortality in 2020. The overall burden of CLL is significant, particularly in the context of an aging global population, which may contribute to the increasing prevalence of this hematological malignancy.\n\nIn summary, while specific global prevalence figures for CLL are not detailed in the gathered information, the trends indicate a rising incidence and significant health burden associated with the disease.
