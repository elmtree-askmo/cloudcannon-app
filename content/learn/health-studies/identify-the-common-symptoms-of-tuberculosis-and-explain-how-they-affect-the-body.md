    Identify the common symptoms of Tuberculosis and explain how they affect the body.
answer: >-
    Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection primarily caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, which predominantly affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. The common symptoms of TB include:\n\n1. **Persistent Dry Cough**: This is often one of the first symptoms to appear. The cough may become more severe over time and can be accompanied by blood in the sputum as the disease progresses.\n\n2. **Chest Pain**: Patients may experience discomfort or pain in the chest, which can be exacerbated by coughing or deep breathing.\n\n3. **Fatigue**: A general feeling of tiredness and lack of energy is common, which can significantly affect daily activities.\n\n4. **Weakness**: Along with fatigue, individuals may feel weak and unable to perform physical tasks that they could previously manage.\n\n5. **Reduced Oxygen Intake**: Due to the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, lung elasticity is compromised. This leads to decreased tidal volume (the amount of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath) and can result in a reduced ability to exchange oxygen effectively.\n\nThese symptoms collectively affect the body by leading to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, which can cause further complications such as shortness of breath and increased respiratory rate as the body attempts to compensate for the lack of oxygen. The thickening of lung walls due to scar tissue also slows down the diffusion of oxygen, necessitating a faster breathing rate to maintain adequate oxygen levels. This can lead to a cycle of increased effort in breathing and further fatigue.\n\nIn summary, the symptoms of TB not only impact the respiratory system but also have systemic effects, leading to overall weakness and reduced quality of life. Treatment typically involves a long course of antibiotics to combat the infection and manage symptoms effectively.
