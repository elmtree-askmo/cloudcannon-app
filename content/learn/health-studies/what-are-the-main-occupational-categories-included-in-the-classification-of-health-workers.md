    What are the main occupational categories included in the classification of health workers?
answer: >-
    The classification of health workers is primarily based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), specifically the 2008 revision (ISCO-08). This classification system organizes health workers into five broad occupational categories:\n\n1. **Health Professionals**: This group includes individuals who provide direct health care services and possess specialized education and training. Examples include doctors, nurses, and pharmacists.\n\n2. **Health Associate Professionals**: These workers support health professionals and may have specialized training but do not have the same level of education as health professionals. Examples include dental hygienists and medical laboratory technicians.\n\n3. **Personal Care Workers**: This category encompasses those who provide personal care services to individuals, often in a home or community setting. Examples include home health aides and personal support workers.\n\n4. **Health Management and Support Personnel**: This group includes individuals involved in the administration and management of health services, as well as those providing support services. Examples include health service managers and medical secretaries.\n\n5. **Other Health Service Providers**: This category captures a variety of other roles that contribute to health services but do not fit neatly into the previous categories. Examples may include community health workers and health educators.\n\nThese categories help in organizing and analyzing health workforce data, facilitating better management and planning of health services globally.
