answer: >-
    The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, established in 1987 and entering into force in 1989, is a landmark global agreement aimed at protecting the Earth's ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Its implementation has been marked by several key strategies and achievements:\n\n1. **Global Participation**: The Montreal Protocol is unique in that it is the only United Nations environmental agreement ratified by every country in the world. This universal commitment has been crucial for its success, with parties to the Protocol having phased out approximately 98% of the substances responsible for ozone depletion.\n\n2. **Multilateral Fund**: In 1991, the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF) was established to assist developing countries in meeting their commitments. The Fund has approved over $3 billion in activities, including industrial conversion, technical assistance, training, and capacity building, enabling many developing nations to exceed their reduction targets for ODS.\n\n3. **Kigali Amendment**: The Kigali Amendment, adopted in 2016, expanded the Protocol's scope to include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases. Actions under this amendment are projected to prevent the emission of up to 105 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, significantly contributing to global climate mitigation efforts and helping to limit global temperature rise.\n\n4. **Scientific Assessments**: Regular scientific assessments, such as the "2022 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion," have confirmed the positive impact of the Montreal Protocol on the recovery of the ozone layer and its additional benefits in slowing global warming. The ozone layer is projected to recover by the middle of this century due to the sustained implementation of the Protocol.\n\n5. **Annual Meetings**: The parties to the Protocol convene annually to review progress, make decisions, and adjust or amend the agreement as necessary to ensure its effectiveness. This ongoing dialogue is essential for addressing emerging challenges and ensuring compliance.\n\nOverall, the Montreal Protocol serves as a successful model of international cooperation in environmental governance, demonstrating how collective action can effectively address global environmental issues. Its implementation has not only led to the recovery of the ozone layer but has also had significant health benefits, including the prevention of an estimated two million skin cancer cases annually.
