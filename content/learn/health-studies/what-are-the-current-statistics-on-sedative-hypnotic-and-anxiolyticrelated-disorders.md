    What are the current statistics on sedative-, hypnotic-, and anxiolytic-related disorders?
answer: >-
    The current statistics on sedative-, hypnotic-, and anxiolytic-related disorders indicate a notable prevalence and impact on public health. In the United States, the 12-month prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is estimated to be approximately 0.3% of the general population. However, physiological dependence, including tolerance, is much more common among users of these substances.\n\nLifetime prevalence rates for these disorders are slightly higher, with estimates suggesting that 1.0% of the population may experience an anxiolytic use disorder and 1.1% may experience a sedative use disorder. Among individuals with concurrent illicit drug use disorders, the prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder rises significantly to about 6%.\n\nDemographic factors also play a role in the prevalence of these disorders. For instance, adult males are more likely to experience sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders compared to females, while the reverse is true for adolescents aged 12-17 years. Additionally, individuals who are never married or are separated/divorced are at an increased risk of developing these disorders.\n\nOverall, while the use of sedative-hypnotic medications, particularly benzodiazepines, is common, it does not always lead to a use disorder. The data highlights the importance of monitoring and managing the use of these medications to mitigate the risks of dependence and associated health issues.
