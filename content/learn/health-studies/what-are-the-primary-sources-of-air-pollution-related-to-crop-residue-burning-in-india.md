    What are the primary sources of air pollution related to crop residue burning in India?
answer: >-
    The primary sources of air pollution related to crop residue burning in India are primarily linked to the practice of farmers burning leftover straw and stubble after harvesting crops, particularly rice. This practice is prevalent in regions like Punjab and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is known as South Asia's cereal basket. \n\nWhen farmers set fire to crop residues, it releases a variety of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, including:\n\n1. **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: A toxic gas that can impair oxygen delivery in the body.\n2. **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: A greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n3. **Methane (CH4)**: Another potent greenhouse gas that has a significant impact on global warming.\n4. **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**: A gas that contributes to both air pollution and climate change.\n5. **Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10)**: Fine particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and is associated with various health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe burning of crop residues significantly deteriorates air quality, especially during the months of October and November, when the practice is most common. Studies have shown that this seasonal burning contributes to a marked increase in air pollution levels, which can reduce life expectancy in affected areas by several years. Despite government bans and interventions aimed at curbing this practice, crop residue burning remains widespread due to the lack of viable alternatives for farmers to manage their agricultural waste efficiently.\n\nIn summary, crop residue burning is a major contributor to air pollution in India, with significant health and environmental consequences.
