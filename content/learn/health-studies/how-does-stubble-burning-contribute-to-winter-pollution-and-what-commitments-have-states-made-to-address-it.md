    How does stubble burning contribute to winter pollution, and what commitments have states made to address it?
answer: >-
    Stubble burning is a significant contributor to winter pollution, particularly in Northern India, where it occurs primarily during the months of October and November. This practice involves the large-scale burning of crop residues, particularly from rice-wheat systems in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh. The combustion of these residues releases a variety of harmful pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), which can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and pose severe health risks to the population.\n\nResearch indicates that during the stubble burning episodes, there is a drastic increase in pollutant concentrations. For instance, as of November 20, 2024, stubble burning was responsible for approximately 17.3% of the PM2.5 levels in Delhi, according to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). During peak pollution events, the contribution from stubble burning can reach as high as 65%, exacerbated by unfavorable meteorological conditions and other local emissions.\n\nTo address the issue of stubble burning and its contribution to winter pollution, various states have made commitments and implemented action plans. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has issued directives aimed at preventing and controlling stubble burning. These directives include revised action plans for Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, which are based on learnings from previous years (2021, 2022, and 2023). The plans focus on creating awareness about the adverse effects of stubble burning, promoting alternative methods for crop residue management, and ensuring rigorous backend assessments to support effective regulatory governance.\n\nDespite these efforts, challenges remain in fully curbing stubble burning, as it is deeply rooted in agricultural practices and economic considerations. Continuous efforts are needed to enhance awareness, provide incentives for alternative practices, and enforce regulations to mitigate the environmental and health impacts associated with this practice.
