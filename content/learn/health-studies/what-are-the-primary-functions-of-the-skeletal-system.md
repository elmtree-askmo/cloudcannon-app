    What are the primary functions of the skeletal system?
answer: >-
    The skeletal system serves several critical functions in the human body, which can be categorized into external and internal functions. Here are the primary functions of the skeletal system:\n\n1. **Support**: The skeleton provides a rigid framework that supports the body and gives it shape. It holds up the body against the force of gravity and supports soft tissues and organs.\n\n2. **Movement**: Bones act as levers that facilitate movement when muscles contract. The joints between bones allow for a range of motions, enabling activities such as walking, running, and grasping.\n\n3. **Protection**: The skeletal system protects vital internal organs. For example, the skull encases the brain, the rib cage shields the heart and lungs, and the vertebral column safeguards the spinal cord.\n\n4. **Mineral Storage**: Bones serve as a reservoir for essential minerals, particularly calcium and phosphorus. These minerals can be released into the bloodstream as needed to maintain physiological balance.\n\n5. **Hematopoiesis**: The process of blood cell production occurs in the bone marrow, which is found within certain bones. This includes the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nIn summary, the skeletal system is not only a structural framework but also plays vital roles in movement, protection, mineral storage, and blood cell production, making it essential for overall health and functionality.
