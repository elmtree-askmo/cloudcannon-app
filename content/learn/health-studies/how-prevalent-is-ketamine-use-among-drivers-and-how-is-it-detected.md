    How prevalent is ketamine use among drivers, and how is it detected?
answer: >-
    Ketamine use among drivers has been a growing concern, particularly due to its prevalence in drug driving cases. A retrospective study covering the years 2003 to 2020 indicated that ketamine was detected in over 68% of drug driving cases in Hong Kong during the period from 2011 to 2015. This suggests a significant presence of ketamine among drivers involved in incidents related to driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). Additionally, in cases of fatalities among drivers, ketamine was often found in conjunction with other substances, highlighting the polydrug use that complicates the assessment of its effects.\n\nDetection of ketamine in drivers is primarily conducted through blood tests, which can reveal recent use due to the drug's rapid metabolism. However, the detection window is relatively short, making immediate testing after consumption more effective. Standard drug tests typically do not include ketamine; therefore, specific tests must be ordered if ketamine use is suspected. These specialized tests can detect trace amounts of ketamine, particularly in urine, where it can remain detectable for 2 to 4 days after use.\n\nThe effects of ketamine on driving are concerning, as it can impair cognitive and motor functions critical for safe driving. The drug is known to cause dissociation and other psychotropic effects, which can significantly affect a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely. Given these factors, understanding the prevalence of ketamine use among drivers and the methods for its detection is crucial for road safety and effective drug driving legislation.
