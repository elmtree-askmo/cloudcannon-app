    What genetic mutations are commonly associated with cancer?
answer: >-
    Genetic mutations play a significant role in the development of cancer, and they can be broadly categorized into three main types of genes: oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes.\n\n1. **Oncogenes**: These are mutated forms of normal genes (proto-oncogenes) that, when altered, can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division. Common mutations in oncogenes include those in the **PIK3CA** gene, which is often associated with various cancers, including breast cancer.\n\n2. **Tumor Suppressor Genes**: These genes normally function to restrain cell growth and division. When mutations occur in tumor suppressor genes, such as **TP53**, the regulatory mechanisms fail, leading to unregulated cell proliferation. The **p53** gene is particularly notable, as it is damaged or missing in a majority of cancers. Other important tumor suppressor genes include **BRCA1** and **BRCA2**, which are linked to increased risks of breast and ovarian cancers. Mutations in these genes can lead to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes.\n\n3. **DNA Repair Genes**: These genes are responsible for fixing DNA damage. Mutations in DNA repair genes can lead to an accumulation of genetic errors, increasing the risk of cancer. For example, mutations in the **ATM** and **CHEK2** genes are associated with breast cancer risk.\n\nWhile inherited mutations account for about 10-20% of all cancers, the majority of cancer cases arise from acquired mutations that develop over a person's lifetime due to various factors, including environmental influences and lifestyle choices. These acquired mutations can lead to sporadic cancers, which are not linked to inherited genetic predispositions.\n\nIn summary, the most common genetic mutations associated with cancer include those in tumor suppressor genes (like **TP53**, **BRCA1**, and **BRCA2**), oncogenes (such as **PIK3CA**), and DNA repair genes (like **ATM** and **CHEK2**). Understanding these mutations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving cancer treatment outcomes.
