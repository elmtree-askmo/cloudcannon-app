    What are the main types of hearing loss and how do they differ?
answer: >-
    Hearing loss can be classified into three main types, each with distinct characteristics, causes, and treatment options:\n\n1. **Conductive Hearing Loss**: This type occurs when sound waves cannot efficiently travel through the outer or middle ear. It can be caused by various factors, including ear infections, fluid in the middle ear, earwax buildup, perforated eardrum, or abnormalities in the ear structure. Treatment options often include medical interventions, such as medication for infections, removal of earwax, or surgical procedures to correct structural issues.\n\n2. **Sensorineural Hearing Loss**: This type results from damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or the auditory nerve pathways that lead to the brain. Common causes include aging, exposure to loud noises, head trauma, genetic factors, and certain illnesses. Sensorineural hearing loss is typically permanent and may be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants, depending on the severity.\n\n3. **Mixed Hearing Loss**: This type is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. It indicates that there are issues in both the outer/middle ear and the inner ear or auditory nerve. Treatment for mixed hearing loss may involve a combination of approaches used for both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, tailored to the individual's specific needs.\n\nUnderstanding these types of hearing loss is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment, as each type has different underlying causes and management strategies.
