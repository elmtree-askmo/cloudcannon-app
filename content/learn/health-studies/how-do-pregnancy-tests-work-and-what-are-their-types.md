    How do pregnancy tests work and what are their types?
answer: >-
    Pregnancy tests are essential tools for determining whether a woman is pregnant. They work by detecting the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. This hormone builds up rapidly in the body during the early days of pregnancy.\n\nThere are two main types of pregnancy tests:\n\n1. **Urine Tests**: \n   - These are the most common type of pregnancy tests and can be performed at home or in a clinical setting. Home pregnancy tests typically involve either dipping a test stick into a urine sample or placing urine into a special container. \n   - When used correctly, urine tests are about 97% to 99% accurate, especially when taken after a missed period. For optimal results, it is recommended to take the test first thing in the morning, as hCG levels are usually highest at that time.\n\n2. **Blood Tests**: \n   - Blood tests are conducted in a healthcare provider's office and can detect hCG earlier than urine tests. There are two types of blood tests:\n     - **Qualitative hCG blood test**: This test simply checks for the presence of hCG and provides a yes or no answer regarding pregnancy.\n     - **Quantitative hCG blood test**: This test measures the exact amount of hCG in the blood, which can help assess the progression of the pregnancy.\n   - Blood tests are generally more accurate than urine tests and can detect pregnancy even before a missed period.\n\nBoth types of tests are reliable, but false negatives can occur, particularly if the test is taken too early or not according to the instructions. If a negative result is obtained but pregnancy is still suspected, it is advisable to retest after a week or consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
