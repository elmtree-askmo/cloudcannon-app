    What was the response from the professional community regarding the suspension of ENTOD Pharmaceuticals' eye drops?
answer: >-
    The response from the professional community regarding the suspension of ENTOD Pharmaceuticals' eye drops, PresVu, has been mixed, primarily focusing on the claims made by the company and the regulatory actions taken against it. \n\nThe Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) suspended the manufacturing and marketing license for PresVu shortly after its approval, citing misleading claims by ENTOD Pharmaceuticals. The company had asserted that the eye drops could eliminate the need for reading glasses for individuals suffering from presbyopia, which raised concerns among regulatory authorities. The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) specifically took exception to these claims, leading to the suspension.\n\nIn defense of the product, Nikkhil Masurkar, CEO of ENTOD Pharmaceuticals, stated that the approval was based on a valid controlled clinical trial involving 234 patients, which demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the eye drops. He expressed the company's intention to challenge the suspension in court, emphasizing that their public statements were aligned with the DCGI's approval and the results of their clinical trials.\n\nMasurkar also dismissed allegations of unethical or false presentations regarding the product, asserting that all information shared with the media was based on the recent approval and clinical trial results. This indicates a strong pushback from the company against the regulatory decision, highlighting a potential divide between the pharmaceutical industryâ€™s practices and regulatory expectations.\n\nOverall, the professional community appears to be observing the situation closely, with some supporting the regulatory actions for consumer safety, while others may sympathize with the company's position regarding the validity of their claims and the clinical evidence presented.
