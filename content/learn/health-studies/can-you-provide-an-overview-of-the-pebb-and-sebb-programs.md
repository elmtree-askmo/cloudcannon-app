    Can you provide an overview of the PEBB and SEBB programs?
answer: >-
    The Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) and School Employees Benefits Board (SEBB) programs are two distinct health insurance programs administered by the Health Care Authority (HCA) in Washington State, designed to provide benefits to public employees and school employees, respectively.\n\n### PEBB Program\nThe PEBB Program offers health insurance and other benefits to eligible public employees, including state employees, higher education employees, and certain other public employees. Key features of the PEBB Program include:\n\n- **Coverage Options**: Employees can choose from various medical, dental, and vision plans. However, they may not enroll in both PEBB and SEBB benefits simultaneously.\n- **Waiving Coverage**: Employees can waive their PEBB medical coverage if they have access to other employer-sponsored health care, Medicare, or TRICARE. If they opt out, they cannot enroll dependents in PEBB medical coverage.\n- **Annual Enrollment**: The program has an annual benefits cycle where employees can review and select their benefits.\n\n### SEBB Program\nThe SEBB Program was established to provide benefits specifically for school employees, promoting transparency and accountability in state expenditures for school employee benefits. Key aspects of the SEBB Program include:\n\n- **Eligibility**: The SEBB Program is available to K-12 school employees, and many K-12 PEBB members transitioned to the SEBB Program starting in 2020.\n- **Benefits Offered**: The SEBB Program provides basic life and accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance at no cost to eligible school employees. It also includes various medical, dental, and vision plans.\n- **Open Enrollment**: The SEBB Program has its own open enrollment period, allowing school employees to select their benefits annually.\n\n### Comparison and Interaction\nWhile both programs offer similar types of benefits, they are independent of each other. Employees can only enroll in one program at a time, and dual enrollment is not permitted. If a school employee is eligible for both PEBB and SEBB, they must choose one program for their benefits.\n\nFor more detailed information about the specific benefits, coverage options, and enrollment processes for both programs, individuals can visit the respective websites or the HCA's official site.
