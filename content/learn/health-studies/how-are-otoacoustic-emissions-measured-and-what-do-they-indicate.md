    How are otoacoustic emissions measured and what do they indicate?
answer: >-
    Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are sounds produced by the movement of outer hair cells within a properly functioning cochlea when stimulated by external sounds. They can be measured using a specialized probe that is inserted into the external auditory canal. This probe contains a loudspeaker that generates sounds and a microphone that records the emissions.\n\nThe measurement process involves presenting a series of sounds to the ear through the probe. The emitted sounds, which are very quiet, echo back into the middle ear and can be detected by the microphone. There are two main types of OAEs: spontaneous OAEs (SOAEs), which occur continuously without external stimuli, and evoked OAEs (EOAEs), which are generated in response to specific auditory stimuli.\n\nThe presence of OAEs indicates normal function of the outer hair cells in the cochlea, which is often correlated with normal hearing sensitivity. Therefore, OAE testing serves as a valuable tool for screening hearing loss, particularly in newborns and other populations where traditional hearing tests may not be feasible. It is a quick, painless, and non-invasive procedure that provides a direct measure of cochlear function.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while OAEs can indicate the health of the outer hair cells, they do not assess the function of inner hair cells or the auditory nerve. Thus, while OAEs are a useful screening tool, they are typically part of a broader auditory assessment battery.
