    At what age do infants typically start rolling over?
answer: >-
    Infants typically start rolling over around 4 months of age, although this can vary from child to child. At this age, babies may begin by rocking from side to side, which lays the groundwork for rolling over. By 6 months, most babies can roll over in both directionsâ€” from tummy to back and back to tummy. \n\nIt's important to note that rolling over is a significant developmental milestone that indicates the strengthening of neck and arm muscles, as well as improved head control. While some infants may roll over as early as 3 months, the majority will achieve this skill by 4 to 6 months. The process of rolling over not only aids in physical development but also contributes to sensory-motor integration, helping babies develop their balance and body awareness. \n\nAs each baby develops at their own pace, some may take longer to reach this milestone, and caregivers are encouraged to provide opportunities for tummy time and play to support their infant's development.
