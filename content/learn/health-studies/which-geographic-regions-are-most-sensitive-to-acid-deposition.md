    Which geographic regions are most sensitive to acid deposition?
answer: >-
    Acid deposition, commonly referred to as acid rain, significantly impacts various geographic regions, particularly those with sensitive ecosystems. The regions most sensitive to acid deposition include:\n\n1. **Central Appalachian Mountain Region**: This area, encompassing parts of Virginia and West Virginia, experiences some of the highest levels of acidic deposition in the United States. The streams in this region are particularly vulnerable, showing significant acidity and sensitivity to acid deposition.\n\n2. **Northeast United States**: The Adirondack and Catskill Mountains in New York are notable for their ecological damage due to acidification. Many lakes and streams in these areas have been severely affected, leading to a decline in fish populations and overall biodiversity.\n\n3. **Southern Appalachian Region**: This area has been assessed for its susceptibility to acid deposition, with various tiers of sensitivity identified. The ecological impacts here are also significant, affecting both terrestrial and aquatic environments.\n\n4. **Central Europe and Southern Scandinavia**: In the 1970s and 1980s, these regions exhibited alarming signs of forest dieback and tree mortality due to acid rain. Surveys indicated widespread damage to trees, with a significant percentage showing signs of pollution-related stress.\n\n5. **East Asia**: This region, despite contributing a fraction of the global emissions responsible for acid deposition, bears a large portion of its environmental impacts. The terrestrial and aquatic environments in East Asia are significantly affected by acid deposition.\n\nOverall, acid-sensitive regions are characterized by their unique geological and ecological features, which make them more susceptible to the adverse effects of acidic deposition, including soil degradation, forest stress, and aquatic ecosystem damage.
