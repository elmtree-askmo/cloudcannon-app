    What are the treatment options for renal cell carcinoma?
answer: >-
    Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment options are diverse and depend on the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and specific tumor characteristics. Here are the primary treatment modalities:\n\n1. **Surgery**: The first-line treatment for localized renal cell carcinoma is often surgical intervention. This may involve:\n   - **Nephrectomy**: Complete removal of the kidney containing the tumor.\n   - **Partial Nephrectomy**: Removal of the tumor while preserving as much healthy kidney tissue as possible. This approach is increasingly favored for smaller tumors.\n\n2. **Ablation Techniques**: For patients who are not candidates for surgery, less invasive procedures such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation may be used to destroy cancer cells.\n\n3. **Targeted Therapy**: These treatments focus on specific pathways involved in cancer growth. Common targeted therapies for RCC include:\n   - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib.\n   - mTOR inhibitors like everolimus and temsirolimus.\n\n4. **Immunotherapy**: This approach harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have shown effectiveness in treating advanced RCC.\n\n5. **Chemotherapy**: While not typically effective for RCC, it may be used in certain cases, particularly for specific subtypes or in combination with other treatments.\n\n6. **Radiation Therapy**: This may be used for palliative care to relieve symptoms in advanced cases or for patients who cannot undergo surgery.\n\n7. **Arterial Embolization**: This technique involves blocking the blood supply to the tumor, which can help shrink it before surgery or alleviate symptoms in advanced disease.\n\n8. **Surveillance**: For patients with localized disease who are not candidates for immediate treatment, active surveillance may be an option, monitoring the tumor for changes over time.\n\nRecent advancements in treatment include the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and combinations of immunotherapy with targeted therapies, which have improved outcomes for patients with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.\n\nOverall, the choice of treatment should be individualized, and patients are encouraged to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each option with their healthcare provider.
