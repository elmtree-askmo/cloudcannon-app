    Can you provide examples of core biochemical tests commonly performed in CBC labs?
answer: >-
    Core biochemical tests commonly performed in Clinical Biochemistry (CBC) laboratories are essential for diagnosing various pathological conditions and monitoring patient health. Here are some examples of these core tests:\n\n1. **Glucose Tests**:\n   - **Fasting Blood Glucose**: Measures blood sugar levels after fasting, used to diagnose diabetes.\n   - **Postprandial Glucose**: Measures blood sugar levels after eating, helps assess glucose metabolism.\n\n2. **Electrolyte Panel**:\n   - **Sodium (Na)**: Important for fluid balance and nerve function.\n   - **Potassium (K)**: Critical for heart and muscle function.\n   - **Chloride (Cl)**: Helps maintain acid-base balance.\n\n3. **Renal Function Tests**:\n   - **Urea**: Indicates kidney function and hydration status.\n   - **Creatinine**: Assesses kidney function; elevated levels may indicate renal impairment.\n\n4. **Liver Function Tests**:\n   - **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)**: Elevated levels can indicate liver damage.\n   - **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)**: Used to assess liver health and detect liver disease.\n\n5. **Thyroid Function Tests**:\n   - **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)**: Evaluates thyroid function; abnormal levels can indicate hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.\n\n6. **Lipid Profile**:\n   - **Total Cholesterol**: Assesses cardiovascular risk.\n   - **Triglycerides**: High levels can indicate risk for heart disease.\n\n7. **Uric Acid**: Elevated levels can indicate gout or kidney issues.\n\nThese tests are routinely requested by clinicians and provide valuable information for diagnosing conditions, monitoring treatment responses, and guiding clinical decisions. The results from these core biochemical tests are crucial for effective patient management in various medical contexts.
