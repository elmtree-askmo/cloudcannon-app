answer: >-
    Under the topic of Environmental and Personal Safety Awareness, several key areas are covered, particularly relevant to the context of Fiji. These include:\n\n1. **Awareness of the Environment**: This involves understanding the natural hazards that can affect Fiji, such as cyclones, floods, and fires. Students learn about the tropical climate and the challenges it presents, especially during the cyclone season from November to April. Preparation and information are emphasized as crucial for safety during these natural disasters.\n\n2. **Personal Safety**: This aspect focuses on identifying, describing, and discussing risks and hazards in one's environment that may pose a threat to health and safety. It includes practical safety skills that students can practice to ensure a safe environment, such as avoiding dangerous play areas like stairs or high places.\n\n3. **School Emergencies**: The curriculum addresses the impact of natural disasters on school operations and the importance of being prepared for emergencies. This includes understanding how to respond to various situations that may arise in a school setting due to environmental factors.\n\n4. **Travel Health and Personal Wellbeing**: Safety in Fiji also encompasses personal health, which involves looking after one's health while being aware of external factors that could affect it. This includes understanding cultural norms and respecting local regulations to avoid misunderstandings and potential penalties.\n\nOverall, the Environmental and Personal Safety Awareness topics aim to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their environment safely and responsibly, particularly in the context of the unique challenges presented by Fiji's geography and climate.
