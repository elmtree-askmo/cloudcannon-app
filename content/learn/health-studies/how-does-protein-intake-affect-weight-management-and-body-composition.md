    How does protein intake affect weight management and body composition?
answer: >-
    Protein intake plays a significant role in weight management and body composition. Over the past two decades, higher-protein diets have been recognized as an effective strategy for preventing and treating obesity. This effectiveness is attributed to several factors, including modulations in energy metabolism, appetite control, and overall energy intake.\n\nResearch indicates that individuals who consume a higher percentage of their energy intake from protein tend to experience better weight management outcomes. For instance, a study involving moderately overweight individuals showed that those who consumed 18% of their energy as protein during a weight management phase regained less weight compared to those who consumed only 15% protein. Specifically, the higher protein group regained 50% less body weight over a three-month maintenance period, likely due to increased satiety and decreased energy efficiency.\n\nMoreover, a systematic review of 37 studies found that participants with increased protein intake (ranging from 18% to 59% of energy) lost an average of 1.6 kg more than those on lower protein diets. This weight loss was observed in both energy-restricted and standard-energy diets, suggesting that higher protein intake can be beneficial regardless of the overall caloric context.\n\nIn terms of body composition, higher protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/kg of body weight per day) is associated with the preservation of lean body mass during weight loss. Maintaining lean muscle mass is crucial because it helps prevent a decrease in metabolic rate, which is the rate at which the body burns calories at rest. Additionally, protein has a higher thermic effect compared to fats and carbohydrates, meaning the body expends more energy digesting protein.\n\nOverall, increasing protein intake can lead to improved body composition by promoting fat loss while preserving muscle mass, making it a valuable component of weight management strategies. However, it is essential to balance protein intake with overall dietary needs and individual health conditions.
