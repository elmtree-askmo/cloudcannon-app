    What is the lytic cycle in bacteriophages?
answer: >-
    The lytic cycle is one of the two primary pathways of viral reproduction in bacteriophages, the other being the lysogenic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, takes control of its cellular machinery, and ultimately leads to the destruction of the host cell. This cycle is characterized by several distinct stages:\n\n1. **Adsorption**: The first step involves the attachment of the bacteriophage to the surface of the bacterial cell. The phage's tail fibers and surface proteins recognize and bind to specific receptors on the bacterial cell wall.\n\n2. **Penetration**: After adsorption, the bacteriophage injects its genetic material (DNA or RNA) into the host cell, while the protein coat remains outside.\n\n3. **Biosynthesis**: Once inside, the viral genome takes over the host's cellular machinery to synthesize viral components. Early proteins are produced that often degrade the host's DNA, allowing the phage to commandeer the cell's resources for its own replication.\n\n4. **Maturation**: In this stage, new phage particles are assembled from the synthesized components. This includes the packaging of the viral genome into new capsids.\n\n5. **Release**: The final step involves the lysis (bursting) of the host cell, which releases the newly formed virions into the environment. This destruction of the host cell allows the phages to infect new bacterial cells.\n\nThe lytic cycle is often referred to as a virulent infection because it results in the death of the host cell. Bacteriophages that exclusively undergo this cycle are known as virulent phages. An example of a bacteriophage that follows the lytic cycle is the T4 phage, which infects Escherichia coli. \n\nIn summary, the lytic cycle is a rapid and destructive process that enables bacteriophages to reproduce efficiently by utilizing the host cell's machinery, ultimately leading to the release of new virions that can infect additional bacterial cells.
