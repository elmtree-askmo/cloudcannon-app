answer: >-
    The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is a significant health assurance scheme in India, and its recent expansion has introduced several key features aimed at enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens. Here are the main features of the expansion:\n\n1. **Coverage for Senior Citizens**: The scheme now provides free treatment benefits of up to â‚¹5 lakh per year on a family basis for all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of their socio-economic status. This expansion is expected to benefit approximately 6 crore senior citizens.\n\n2. **Cashless Healthcare Services**: Eligible individuals can avail of cashless healthcare services at empanelled hospitals, ensuring that they do not face any out-of-pocket expenses for covered treatments.\n\n3. **Inclusion of Pre-existing Conditions**: One of the standout features of AB PM-JAY is that it covers pre-existing diseases from day one. This means that individuals with ongoing health issues can seek treatment immediately after enrolling in the scheme without any waiting period.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The scheme covers a wide range of medical expenses, including pre-hospitalization (up to three days), hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses (up to 15 days), which include medicines, diagnostic services, and physician fees.\n\n5. **Distinct Ayushman Card for Seniors**: Senior citizens aged 70 and above will receive a new, distinct Ayushman card under the AB PM-JAY scheme, facilitating easier access to healthcare services.\n\n6. **Choice of Schemes**: Senior citizens who are already enrolled in other public health insurance schemes, such as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) or the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), have the option to either continue with their current scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY.\n\n7. **Integration with Digital Health Infrastructure**: The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) supports the scheme by providing a robust digital health infrastructure, which includes the Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts (ABHA) to streamline healthcare services.\n\n8. **Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: The expansion reflects India's commitment to universal health coverage and aims to ensure that "no one is left behind," aligning with the broader goals of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOverall, the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana represents a significant step towards improving healthcare access and reducing the financial burden on families, particularly for the elderly population in India.
