    How have employment trends in health care changed over the past decade?
answer: >-
    Over the past decade, employment trends in the healthcare sector have shown significant growth, although projections indicate a moderation in this growth moving forward. From 2013 to 2023, the healthcare industry in the United States added approximately 3.6 million jobs, representing a growth rate of 25%. This growth was particularly pronounced in ambulatory health care services, which is expected to continue expanding, with an anticipated addition of 1.2 million jobs from 2023 to 2033, translating to a growth rate of 13.7%.\n\nDespite the robust growth in healthcare employment, the sector experienced a notable decline at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment in healthcare fell from 16.5 million in February 2020 to 14.9 million in April 2020, marking an 8.2% decrease. However, the sector rebounded relatively quickly, and by 2022, healthcare employment had reached approximately 16.3 million, making it the largest employment sector in the U.S. \n\nIn 2022, healthcare occupations accounted for 9.3% of total employment, with registered nurses being the largest group, numbering around 3.4 million. The healthcare sector has historically been considered recession-proof, as evidenced during the Great Recession when employment continued to rise even as other sectors faced significant declines.\n\nLooking ahead, while the healthcare sector is projected to continue growing, the pace of job creation is expected to slow compared to the previous decade. Factors such as technological advancements, including the rise of telehealth and artificial intelligence, may influence employment dynamics, potentially leading to slower-than-average job growth in certain occupations.\n\nIn summary, the healthcare sector has experienced substantial growth over the past decade, rebounded from pandemic-related declines, and is projected to continue expanding, albeit at a moderated pace in the coming years.
