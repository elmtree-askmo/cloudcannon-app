    What are the criteria for the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2023?
answer: >-
    The Swachh Survekshan Awards 2023, conferred by President Droupadi Murmu at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, are part of a flagship initiative by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) aimed at assessing cleanliness, hygiene, and sanitation in cities and towns across India. The awards are based on a comprehensive methodology that includes two main criteria: citizen feedback and field assessment.\n\n### Key Criteria for Evaluation:\n1. **Citizen Feedback**: This involves gathering opinions and experiences from residents regarding the cleanliness of their cities.\n2. **Field Assessment**: A team of over 3,000 assessors conducts direct observations to evaluate various cleanliness parameters.\n\n### Key Parameters Considered:\n- **Door-to-Door Waste Collection**: The effectiveness and coverage of waste collection services.\n- **Source Segregation**: The extent to which waste is sorted at the source into recyclable and non-recyclable categories.\n- **Cleanliness of Public Areas**: The condition of public spaces, including parks, streets, and markets.\n- **Clean Water Bodies**: The cleanliness and maintenance of local water bodies.\n- **Overall Cleanliness Ratings**: Based on the feedback from citizens regarding their perception of cleanliness in their cities.\n\n### Awards and Themes:\n- The theme for Swachh Survekshan 2023 was "Waste to Wealth," emphasizing the transformation of waste into valuable resources. For the upcoming 2024 survey, the theme will shift to "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle."\n- The awards recognize various categories, including the cleanest city, cleanest state, and other zonal awards for medium and small cities.\n\n### Notable Achievements:\n- Indore was named the cleanest city for the seventh consecutive year, with Surat following closely as the second cleanest city. Both cities achieved 100% door-to-door waste collection and high rates of waste segregation.\n\nThe Swachh Survekshan initiative not only aims to improve urban sanitation but also encourages citizen participation and awareness regarding cleanliness and hygiene in their communities.
