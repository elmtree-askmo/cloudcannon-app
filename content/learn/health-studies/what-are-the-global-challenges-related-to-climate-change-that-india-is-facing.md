    What are the global challenges related to climate change that India is facing?
answer: >-
    India faces several global challenges related to climate change, which significantly impact its natural environment, economy, and society. Here are some of the key challenges:\n\n1. **Extreme Weather Events**: India is experiencing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, and erratic monsoon patterns. These events not only threaten agricultural productivity but also lead to significant economic losses and displacement of communities.\n\n2. **Health Impacts**: Climate change is projected to exacerbate health issues in India, particularly malnutrition and related disorders. For instance, child stunting is expected to increase by 35% by 2050 due to climate-related factors, disproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable populations.\n\n3. **Water Scarcity**: Declining groundwater reserves pose a severe challenge, as water scarcity affects agriculture, drinking water supply, and overall livelihoods. The changing climate is contributing to the depletion of these vital resources.\n\n4. **Economic Growth vs. Climate Targets**: India is striving to achieve equitable economic growth for its 1.4 billion people while simultaneously meeting national and global climate change targets. This balancing act is crucial as India emits about 3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases annually, accounting for approximately 7% of global emissions despite having 17% of the world’s population.\n\n5. **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: The pervasive effects of climate change hinder India's progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) on climate action. The interplay between climate change and other issues, such as air quality and health, complicates efforts to address these challenges comprehensively.\n\n6. **International Climate Diplomacy**: India has been a key player in international climate negotiations, advocating for the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities. However, the evolving global climate landscape requires India to navigate complex diplomatic challenges while ensuring that its developmental needs are met.\n\n7. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change is also linked to biodiversity loss, which poses a threat to ecosystems and the services they provide. Integrating ecosystem-based approaches into national climate strategies is essential for addressing these intertwined challenges.\n\nIn summary, India's climate challenges are multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach that balances economic development with environmental sustainability. The country’s efforts to address these challenges are critical not only for its own future but also for global climate stability.
