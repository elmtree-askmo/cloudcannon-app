    What are the types and functions of proteins in human nutrition?
answer: >-
    Proteins are essential macromolecules in human nutrition, playing a variety of critical roles in the body. They are composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. There are twenty different types of naturally occurring amino acids that can be combined in unique sequences to form various proteins, each with specific functions.\n\n### Types of Proteins\n\n1. **Structural Proteins**: These proteins provide support and shape to cells and tissues. Examples include collagen, which is the most abundant protein in the body, found in bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin.\n\n2. **Enzymatic Proteins**: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions, facilitating processes such as digestion and metabolism. They are crucial for breaking down food and synthesizing new molecules.\n\n3. **Transport Proteins**: These proteins are responsible for transporting substances throughout the body. Hemoglobin, for example, is a transport protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues.\n\n4. **Hormonal Proteins**: Some proteins function as hormones, which are signaling molecules that regulate physiological processes. Insulin, for instance, is a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels.\n\n5. **Defensive Proteins**: These proteins play a role in the immune response. Antibodies are proteins that help identify and neutralize foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.\n\n6. **Contractile Proteins**: Found in muscle tissue, these proteins are involved in movement. Actin and myosin are key proteins that enable muscle contraction.\n\n### Functions of Proteins\n\n- **Growth and Repair**: Proteins are vital for the growth and maintenance of body tissues. They are involved in the repair of cells and tissues after injury.\n\n- **Oxygen Transport**: Proteins like hemoglobin are essential for transporting oxygen throughout the body, ensuring that tissues receive the necessary oxygen for metabolism.\n\n- **Regulation of Body Processes**: Proteins play a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including pH balance and fluid balance.\n\n- **Nutrient Supply**: Proteins provide amino acids that are necessary for the synthesis of new proteins and other important molecules in the body.\n\n- **Energy Source**: While carbohydrates and fats are the primary energy sources, proteins can also be used for energy when necessary, particularly during periods of fasting or intense exercise.\n\n### Dietary Sources of Protein\n\nTo meet protein needs, individuals can consume a variety of protein-rich foods, which can be categorized into:\n\n- **Animal-based Proteins**: These include lean meats (chicken, turkey, beef), fish, dairy products, and eggs, which are considered high-quality protein sources due to their complete amino acid profiles.\n\n- **Plant-based Proteins**: Sources include legumes (beans, lentils), nuts, seeds, and soy products (tofu, tempeh). While many plant proteins are incomplete (lacking one or more essential amino acids), combining different plant sources can provide a complete amino acid profile.\n\n### Recommended Intake\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that adults consume at least 0.83 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This requirement may vary based on age, activity level, and overall health.\n\nIn summary, proteins are fundamental to numerous physiological functions and are crucial for maintaining overall health. A balanced diet that includes a variety of protein sources is essential for meeting the body's needs.
