    What are the main objectives of Healthy People 2030?
answer: >-
    Healthy People 2030 is a comprehensive initiative that sets science-based, data-driven national objectives aimed at improving the health and well-being of individuals across the United States over the next decade. The main objectives of Healthy People 2030 can be categorized into three types: core, developmental, and research objectives.\n\n1. **Core Objectives**: These are measurable objectives that are associated with specific targets for the decade. Healthy People 2030 includes approximately 358 core objectives, which focus on various health issues and are designed to drive action toward improving health outcomes. A subset of 23 high-priority core objectives has been identified to particularly emphasize areas of significant public health concern.\n\n2. **Developmental Objectives**: These objectives are not yet fully measurable but are important for future public health initiatives. They may evolve into core objectives as more data becomes available or as public health priorities shift.\n\n3. **Research Objectives**: These objectives address public health issues that have a high health or economic burden or significant implications for health outcomes. They are intended to guide research efforts and may eventually become core objectives if they meet the necessary criteria.\n\nIn addition to these categories, Healthy People 2030 emphasizes several overarching goals, including:\n- **Eliminating health disparities**: A key focus is on achieving health equity and addressing social determinants of health that contribute to health disparities.\n- **Promoting health literacy**: Enhancing the ability of individuals to understand and use health information effectively is a priority.\n- **Improving overall health and well-being**: The initiative aims to enhance the quality of life for all individuals by promoting healthy behaviors and environments.\n\nHealthy People 2030 also incorporates feedback from stakeholders and aims to align with other public health initiatives, ensuring that the objectives are relevant and actionable at national, state, and local levels. The initiative provides a framework for tracking progress and implementing evidence-based strategies to improve health outcomes across diverse populations.
