The following roles are typically included under this classification:\n\n1. **Acupuncturists**: Practitioners who use needles to stimulate specific points on the body to alleviate pain and treat various health conditions.\n\n2. **Ayurvedic Practitioners**: Professionals who utilize the principles of Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, focusing on balancing bodily systems through diet, herbal treatment, and yogic breathing.\n\n3. **Homeopaths**: Practitioners who use homeopathic remedies, which are highly diluted substances, to stimulate the body's self-healing processes.\n\n4. **Herbalists**: Specialists who use plants and plant extracts for medicinal purposes, often providing guidance on the use of herbal remedies for various ailments.\n\n5. **Traditional Medicine Practitioners**: This category includes various practitioners who utilize indigenous healing practices, which may vary significantly across different cultures and regions.\n\n6. **Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals**: This group includes those whose practice requires less extensive formal education and training, often learned through community traditions and practices.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the importance of these roles in achieving health and well-being, as well as universal health coverage (UHC).
