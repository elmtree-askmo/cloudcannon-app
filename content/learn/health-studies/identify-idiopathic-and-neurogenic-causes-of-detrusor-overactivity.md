    Identify idiopathic and neurogenic causes of detrusor overactivity.
answer: >-
    Detrusor overactivity (DO) can be classified into two main categories: idiopathic and neurogenic. \n\n### Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity (IDO)\nIdiopathic detrusor overactivity refers to cases where there is no identifiable underlying cause for the involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle. This condition is often diagnosed when patients exhibit symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) without any apparent neurological or structural abnormalities. The exact mechanisms behind idiopathic detrusor overactivity remain unclear, but it is believed to involve changes in bladder function that are not linked to any specific pathology. Hormonal changes, particularly in postmenopausal women, may also influence bladder behavior, potentially contributing to this condition.\n\n### Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO)\nNeurogenic detrusor overactivity, on the other hand, is associated with identifiable neurological conditions that affect the central or peripheral nervous system. Common causes of NDO include:\n\n- **Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)**: Damage to the spinal cord can disrupt normal bladder control, leading to involuntary contractions.\n- **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: This autoimmune disease can affect the nerves that control bladder function, resulting in NDO.\n- **Stroke**: Neurological damage from a stroke can lead to altered bladder control mechanisms.\n- **Cerebral Palsy**: This condition can also impact bladder function due to neurological impairment.\n- **Parkinson's Disease**: The neurodegenerative nature of this disease can affect bladder control.\n- **Traumatic Brain Injury**: Damage to the brain can disrupt the pathways that regulate bladder activity.\n\nIn neurogenic detrusor overactivity, the pathology often involves alterations in the electromechanical properties of the detrusor smooth muscle, leading to increased excitability and involuntary contractions. This can result in high bladder pressure, which may cause complications such as upper urinary tract damage and urinary incontinence.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, idiopathic detrusor overactivity is characterized by the absence of identifiable causes, while neurogenic detrusor overactivity is linked to specific neurological conditions. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective diagnosis and management of bladder dysfunction.
