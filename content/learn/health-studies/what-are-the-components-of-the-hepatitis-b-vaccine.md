    What are the components of the Hepatitis B vaccine?
answer: >-
    The Hepatitis B vaccine is designed to protect against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is made from components of the virus itself. The primary component of the vaccine is the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which is a protein derived from the virus. This protein is produced by inserting the genetic code for HBsAg into yeast cells, allowing for the safe production of the antigen without the risk of viral DNA contamination.\n\nThere are several formulations of the Hepatitis B vaccine currently available, including:\n\n1. **Engerix-B**:\n   - **Antigen**: Surface protein from hepatitis B virus (HBsAg)\n   - **Adjuvant**: Aluminum hydroxide\n   - **Stabilizers**: Sodium chloride, Disodium phosphate dihydrate, Sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate\n   - **Preservatives**: None\n   - **Residual byproducts**: Proteins from yeast cells used to grow the virus\n\n2. **Heplisav-B**:\n   - **Antigen**: Surface protein from hepatitis B virus (HBsAg)\n   - **Adjuvant**: Contains a novel adjuvant (CpG 1018)\n   - **Stabilizers**: Not specified in the gathered information\n   - **Preservatives**: None\n   - **Residual byproducts**: Not specified in the gathered information\n\nBoth vaccines are administered in a series of doses, typically 3 or 4 shots over a 6-month period, with the first dose often given at birth for infants. The vaccines are effective in generating an immune response that protects against hepatitis B infection and its potential complications, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.\n\nIt is important to note that the Hepatitis B vaccine cannot cause hepatitis B infection, as it contains only parts of the virus. Additionally, individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any components of the vaccine or yeast hypersensitivity should avoid receiving the vaccine.\n\nOverall, the Hepatitis B vaccine is a crucial tool in preventing hepatitis B infection and is part of global efforts to eradicate the disease.
