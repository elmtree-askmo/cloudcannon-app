    What were the specific contributions of each author in the study?
answer: >-
    In the study regarding anaerobic capacity measurement and the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD), the specific contributions of each author were as follows:\n\n1. **EA (First Author)**: EA was responsible for designing the study, analyzing the data, interpreting the results, and writing the first draft of the article. This indicates a significant role in both the conceptual framework and the execution of the research.\n\n2. **PB, AS, and TS (Co-Authors)**: These authors were primarily responsible for data collection. Their contributions were crucial for gathering the empirical evidence needed to support the study's findings.\n\nThis collaborative effort highlights the importance of both study design and data collection in research, ensuring that the findings are valid and reliable. The study aimed to analyze the relationship between anaerobic components of MAOD and the 30-second Wingate anaerobic test, contributing to the understanding of anaerobic capacity measurement methodologies in sports science.
