    How prevalent are benign thyroid nodules in the general population?
answer: >-
    Benign thyroid nodules are highly prevalent in the general population, with estimates suggesting that they can be found in approximately 60% of individuals. The prevalence varies significantly based on the diagnostic techniques used, with studies reporting that about 2% to 65% of the population may have thyroid nodules. Specifically, palpation can detect nodules in about 2-6% of individuals, while ultrasound examinations can reveal a higher prevalence of 19-35%.\n\nMost thyroid nodules (over 90%) are benign, and the likelihood of having at least one thyroid nodule increases with age and is more common in women. Many of these nodules are often discovered incidentally during imaging studies or routine physical examinations, and most patients with thyroid nodules do not experience any symptoms. \n\nIn summary, benign thyroid nodules are a common finding, with a significant portion of the population likely to have them, particularly as they age.
