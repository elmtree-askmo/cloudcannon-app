    What are the primary dietary sources of Vitamin C for primates?
answer: >-
    The primary dietary sources of Vitamin C for primates are predominantly fruits. Most primates, including humans, are unable to synthesize Vitamin C due to a genetic mutation that affects the enzyme necessary for its production. This mutation prevents the final step in the synthesis pathway, making dietary intake essential.\n\nFruits are rich in Vitamin C and serve as the main source for most primates. Their dietary adaptations, such as grasping hands and opposable thumbs, facilitate the foraging and consumption of fruits. In addition to fruits, some primates may obtain Vitamin C from other sources, including:\n\n1. **Animal Matter:** Certain primates have been observed consuming animal products, such as mammal livers and reptile kidneys, which can also contain Vitamin C.\n2. **Insects:** Some smaller primates may include insects in their diet, which can provide additional Vitamin C.\n\nOverall, the reliance on fruits and the ability to exploit various food sources are crucial for maintaining adequate Vitamin C levels in primates, especially considering the potential health risks associated with deficiency, such as scurvy.
