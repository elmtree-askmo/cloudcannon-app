    What is the conjunctiva and what function does it serve in the eye?
answer: >-
    The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva) and covers the anterior surface of the eyeball, except for the cornea (bulbar conjunctiva). It is composed of non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium, which includes goblet cells that produce mucus.\n\nThe primary functions of the conjunctiva include:\n\n1. **Protection**: The conjunctiva acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of pathogens and foreign particles into the eye. It plays a role in immune surveillance, helping to protect the eye from infections.\n\n2. **Lubrication**: The conjunctiva contributes to the tear film by secreting mucin through its goblet cells. This helps to keep the eye surface moist and stable, reducing friction during blinking and preventing dryness.\n\n3. **Facilitating Eye Movement**: By providing a smooth, lubricated surface, the conjunctiva allows the eyelids to glide over the eye easily, which is essential for comfortable eye movement.\n\n4. **Tear Film Maintenance**: The conjunctiva helps distribute fresh tear fluid across the surface of the eye with each blink, renewing the tear film and maintaining ocular health.\n\nCommon conditions affecting the conjunctiva include conjunctivitis (inflammation or infection, often referred to as pink eye) and subconjunctival hemorrhages (bleeding under the conjunctiva). Symptoms of conjunctival irritation can include redness, itching, and a sensation of dryness in the eyes. \n\nOverall, the conjunctiva plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of the eye.
