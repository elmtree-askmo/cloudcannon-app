    What differentiates the restricting type from the binge/purge type in anorexia nervosa?
answer: >-
    Anorexia nervosa is classified into two subtypes: the restricting type (AN-R) and the binge-eating/purging type (AN-BP). The primary distinction between these two subtypes lies in their eating behaviors and methods of weight control.\n\n1. **Restricting Type (AN-R)**: Individuals with this subtype severely limit the amount and type of food they consume. They do not engage in binge eating or purging behaviors. Their weight loss is primarily achieved through extreme dietary restriction and often excessive exercise.\n\n2. **Binge-Eating/Purging Type (AN-BP)**: In contrast, individuals with this subtype experience recurrent episodes of binge eating, followed by purging behaviors. Purging can include self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas. This subtype combines elements of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as it involves periods of food restriction along with episodes of overeating and subsequent purging.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that those with the restricting type do not engage in binge eating or purging, while those with the binge-eating/purging type do experience these behaviors.
