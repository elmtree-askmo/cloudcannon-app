    How does electron microscopy differ from light microscopy in imaging applications?
answer: >-
    Electron microscopy and light microscopy are two distinct imaging techniques used in microscopy, each with its own advantages and limitations.\n\n### Light Microscopy\n- **Principle**: Light microscopy uses visible light to illuminate samples. The light passes through the specimen and is magnified by lenses to produce an image.\n- **Resolution**: The maximum magnification achievable is typically around 1000x to 2000x, limited by the wavelength of visible light. This means that light microscopy can resolve structures down to about 200 nanometers.\n- **Applications**: It is commonly used for observing live cells, tissues, and larger cellular structures. Techniques such as phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy enhance the visualization of specific components within cells.\n- **Limitations**: Due to its lower resolution, light microscopy cannot effectively visualize smaller organelles or detailed structures within cells.\n\n### Electron Microscopy\n- **Principle**: Electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons instead of light to illuminate the sample. The electrons have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, allowing for higher resolution imaging.\n- **Resolution**: Electron microscopy can achieve resolutions of up to 0.1 nanometers, enabling the visualization of fine cellular structures, including organelles and macromolecules.\n- **Types**: There are two main types of electron microscopy:\n  - **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**: Electrons pass through a thin specimen, providing detailed images of internal structures.\n  - **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**: Electrons are scanned across the surface of a specimen, producing three-dimensional images of the surface topography.\n- **Applications**: It is used extensively in cellular biology, materials science, and nanotechnology for detailed structural analysis.\n- **Limitations**: Samples must be prepared in a vacuum and are often fixed and dehydrated, which means live cell imaging is not possible. Additionally, the equipment is more complex and expensive compared to light microscopes.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the primary differences between electron microscopy and light microscopy lie in their resolution capabilities, the type of illumination used, and the types of samples that can be effectively imaged. Electron microscopy provides much higher resolution and is suitable for detailed structural studies, while light microscopy is more accessible for observing live cells and larger structures.
