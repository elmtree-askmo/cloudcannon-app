    How do ligaments and tendons differ in structure and function?
answer: >-
    Ligaments and tendons are both essential components of the musculoskeletal system, but they differ significantly in structure and function.\n\n### Structure\n- **Tendons** are strong, non-flexible bands of connective tissue that connect skeletal muscles to bones. They are primarily composed of collagen fibers, which provide tensile strength, and they have a better blood supply compared to ligaments, aiding in their healing process.\n- **Ligaments**, on the other hand, are flexible and elastic bands of connective tissue that connect one bone to another at the joints. They also consist of collagen fibers but are designed to provide stability and support to joints rather than to facilitate movement.\n\n### Function\n- The primary function of **tendons** is to transmit the force generated by muscles to bones, enabling movement. When a muscle contracts, the tendon pulls on the bone, resulting in motion.\n- **Ligaments** serve to stabilize joints by preventing excessive or abnormal movements that could lead to injury or dislocation. They act as passive restraints, ensuring that bones remain in proper alignment during movement.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Connection**: Tendons connect muscles to bones, while ligaments connect bones to other bones.\n2. **Location**: Tendons are located at the ends of muscles, near joints, facilitating movement. Ligaments are found at joints, providing stability.\n3. **Elasticity**: Tendons are generally less elastic and more rigid, while ligaments are more flexible, allowing for some movement within a joint's safe range.\n4. **Healing**: Tendons have a better blood supply, which contributes to a more efficient healing process compared to ligaments, which have a poorer blood supply and may take longer to heal after injury.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for comprehending how these connective tissues contribute to the overall mechanics of the body, supporting both movement and stability.
