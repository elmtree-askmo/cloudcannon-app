    What is the difference between equivalent dose and effective dose?
answer: >-
    The difference between equivalent dose and effective dose lies primarily in their definitions and applications in radiological protection.\n\n1. **Equivalent Dose**: This is a measure that accounts for the type of radiation and its biological effect on human tissue. It is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose (measured in grays, Gy) by a radiation weighting factor (Wr) that reflects the relative biological effectiveness of the radiation type. The unit of equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv), which is equivalent to joules per kilogram (J kg⁻¹). Equivalent dose is particularly useful for assessing the risk of stochastic effects (like cancer) from different types of radiation.\n\n2. **Effective Dose**: This is a more comprehensive measure that considers not only the equivalent dose but also the varying sensitivities of different tissues and organs to radiation. It is calculated as the weighted sum of the equivalent doses in all irradiated tissues, using tissue weighting factors (Wt) that reflect the relative sensitivity of each organ to radiation. Effective dose is also expressed in sieverts (Sv) and is particularly important for evaluating the overall risk of radiation exposure to the entire body, especially in cases of partial or non-uniform irradiation.\n\nIn summary, while equivalent dose focuses on the type of radiation and its effects on specific tissues, effective dose provides a broader assessment of risk by incorporating the sensitivity of various organs, making it a central feature of radiological protection.
