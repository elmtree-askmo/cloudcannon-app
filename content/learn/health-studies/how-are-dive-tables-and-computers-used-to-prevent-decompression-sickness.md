    How are dive tables and computers used to prevent decompression sickness?
answer: >-
    Dive tables and dive computers are essential tools used by scuba divers to prevent decompression sickness (DCS), commonly known as "the bends." Both tools help divers manage their exposure to nitrogen while underwater, which is crucial for safe ascent and overall dive safety.\n\n### Dive Tables\nDive tables provide a structured way to plan dives by listing maximum depths and corresponding bottom times for various dive profiles. They indicate how long a diver can stay at a certain depth before needing to make mandatory decompression stops during ascent. The tables are based on decompression models that calculate nitrogen absorption and off-gassing times. When using dive tables, divers must:\n\n1. **Plan Dives**: Before diving, divers consult the tables to determine safe depth and time limits.\n2. **Monitor Depth and Time**: Divers track their depth and time underwater to ensure they remain within the limits specified in the tables.\n3. **Ascend Slowly**: Following the ascent rates recommended in the tables is crucial to allow the body to safely off-gas nitrogen.\n\n### Dive Computers\nDive computers have largely replaced traditional dive tables in recreational diving due to their real-time monitoring capabilities. They offer several advantages:\n\n1. **Real-Time Data**: Dive computers continuously track a diver's depth and time, calculating nitrogen absorption based on actual dive profiles rather than theoretical limits.\n2. **Personalized Calculations**: They take into account individual factors such as dive history and physical condition, providing tailored decompression information.\n3. **Ascent Rate Monitoring**: Dive computers track ascent rates and alert divers if they ascend too quickly, helping to prevent DCS.\n\n### Preventing Decompression Sickness\nBoth dive tables and computers emphasize the importance of adhering to safe diving practices, including:\n\n- **Slow Ascent**: Divers should ascend at a rate no faster than 18 meters (60 feet) per minute and make safety stops at shallower depths (e.g., 5 meters or 15 feet) for a few minutes.\n- **Decompression Stops**: Following the recommended decompression stops as indicated by either the dive table or computer is critical for allowing nitrogen to safely off-gas from the body.\n\nIn summary, dive tables and computers are vital for planning and executing safe dives, significantly reducing the risk of decompression sickness by ensuring that divers manage their nitrogen levels effectively throughout their underwater activities.
