    Under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), eligibility for benefits is primarily determined based on socio-economic criteria. The scheme aims to provide health insurance coverage to economically weaker sections of society, specifically targeting poor and vulnerable households across India. Here are the key eligibility criteria:\n\n1. **Rural Families**: \n   - Families identified under the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 that meet at least one of the six deprivation criteria. These criteria include:\n     - Households without shelter\n     - Destitute families or those living on alms\n     - Manual scavenger families\n     - Primitive tribal groups\n     - Legally released bonded labor\n   - Additionally, families that fall under the automatic inclusion criteria are also eligible.\n\n2. **Urban Families**: \n   - Urban families must belong to specific occupational categories to qualify. These include:\n     - Street vendors, domestic workers, construction workers, plumbers, electricians, mechanics, repair workers, painters, artisans, handicrafts workers, tailors, transport workers, security guards, rickshaw pullers, shop workers, and assistants in small establishments.\n\n3. **Senior Citizens**: \n   - Senior citizens aged 70 and above are eligible for a distinct card under the scheme. They can also choose to continue with other public health insurance schemes or opt for AB-PMJAY.\n\n4. **Pre-existing Conditions**: \n   - The scheme covers pre-existing medical conditions, ensuring that beneficiaries can access necessary healthcare services without restrictions.\n\n5. **Coverage**: \n   - The scheme provides coverage of up to â‚¹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.\n\nOverall, the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY is designed to cover approximately 10.74 crore poor and deprived families, ensuring that they have access to essential healthcare services without financial burden.
