    What is the recommended daily intake of protein for different age groups?
answer: >-
    The recommended daily intake of protein varies by age group and specific life stages. Here is a breakdown of the protein requirements for different age groups:\n\n1. **Infants (0-12 Months)**: Infants have the highest protein needs relative to their body weight, primarily obtained from breast milk or formula.\n\n2. **Children**:\n   - **Children under 4 years**: 13 grams of protein per day.\n   - **Children aged 4 to 8 years**: 19 grams of protein per day.\n   - **Children aged 9 to 13 years**: The specific amount is not provided in the gathered information, but it typically increases as children grow.\n\n3. **Adolescents (14-18 years)**: Protein needs increase during this period due to growth and development, but specific values are not detailed in the gathered information.\n\n4. **Adults**:\n   - **Adult women**: Approximately 0.75 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n   - **Adult men**: Approximately 0.84 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n\n5. **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women**: It is recommended that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume about 1.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to support both their health and the development of the baby.\n\n6. **Older Adults (65 years and older)**: Research suggests that older adults should aim for a higher protein intake, approximately 1.0 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, to help maintain muscle mass and physical function.\n\nThese recommendations highlight the importance of adjusting protein intake according to age and specific life stages to support overall health and development.
