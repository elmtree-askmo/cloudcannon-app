    What are the key phenolic compounds found in Brazilian grape varieties?
answer: >-
    The key phenolic compounds found in Brazilian grape varieties include a diverse range of classes, primarily located in the skins and seeds of the grapes. Here are some notable phenolic compounds identified in various Brazilian grape varieties:\n\n1. **Anthocyanins**: These are the primary pigments responsible for the red, blue, and purple colors in grapes. They are predominantly found in the skins. For instance, the Bordô grape (Vitis labrusca) has been noted for its high anthocyanin content.\n\n2. **Flavonols**: This group of compounds contributes to the antioxidant properties of grapes. They are also primarily located in the skins.\n\n3. **Stilbenes**: Notable stilbenes include trans-resveratrol and its isomers, which have been identified in Brazilian wines. These compounds are known for their potential health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n4. **Flavan-3-ols**: These include (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, which are predominantly found in grape seeds. They contribute to the astringency and bitterness of wines.\n\n5. **Phenolic Acids**: Different grape varieties exhibit varying dominant phenolic acids. For example:\n   - **Gallic acid** is the major phenolic acid in 'BRS Carmem'.\n   - **Cinnamic acid** is predominant in 'BRS Violeta'.\n   - **Caffeic acid** is found in 'Isabel Precoce', 'BRS Cora', and 'IAC 138-22 Máximo'.\n\n6. **Total Phenolic Content**: The Bordô grape has been reported to contain approximately 1130 mg/kg of total phenolic compounds (expressed as gallic acid), with a significant concentration in the skins.\n\nThe phenolic composition is influenced by various factors, including grape variety, environmental conditions, and cultural practices. This diversity in phenolic profiles not only affects the sensory characteristics of the grapes and wines produced but also their potential health benefits, particularly due to their antioxidant activity.
