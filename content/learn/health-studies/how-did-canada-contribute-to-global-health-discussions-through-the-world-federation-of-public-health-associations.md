    How did Canada contribute to global health discussions through the World Federation of Public Health Associations?
answer: >-
    Canada has made significant contributions to global health discussions through its involvement with the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA). Here are some key points highlighting Canada's role:\n\n1. **Financial Contributions**: Over the past decade, Canada has contributed more than Can$ 900 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support global health priorities, including initiatives like polio eradication. This financial commitment underscores Canada's dedication to addressing global health challenges.\n\n2. **Global Health Funding Commitment**: In June 2019, Canada announced a 10-Year Commitment (10YC) to increase global health funding from 2020 to 2030, aiming for an average of $1.4 billion annually. This commitment is designed to enhance health outcomes and reduce preventable deaths in developing countries.\n\n3. **Engagement in Global Health Initiatives**: Canada has actively participated in various global health initiatives, including contributing US$40 million to support community health workers through partnerships with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). This involvement reflects Canada's strategic approach to strengthening health systems in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n4. **Advocacy and Policy Development**: The WFPHA plays a crucial role in shaping the global public health agenda, and Canada, through its public health professionals and representatives, contributes to this advocacy. The WFPHA's Global Charter for the Public's Health, developed in 2016, aims to adapt public health frameworks to align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and Canada has been involved in these discussions.\n\n5. **Research and Capacity Building**: The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has engaged in numerous international collaborations to advance global health research and capacity building. This includes participation in 40 international initiatives supported by bilateral and multilateral agreements, positioning Canadian researchers as leaders in global health discussions.\n\n6. **Public Health Infrastructure Development**: Canada's Centre for Public Health Infrastructure supports initiatives that enhance collaboration and information sharing among public health entities, which is vital for addressing global health issues effectively.\n\nThrough these efforts, Canada has established itself as a proactive participant in global health discussions, leveraging its resources, expertise, and commitment to improve health outcomes worldwide.
