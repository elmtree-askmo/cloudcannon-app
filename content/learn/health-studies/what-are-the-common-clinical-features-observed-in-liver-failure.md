    What are the common clinical features observed in liver failure?
answer: >-
    In liver failure, both acute and chronic forms present a range of clinical features that can vary in severity. Here are the common clinical features observed in liver failure:\n\n1. **Jaundice**: This is one of the most noticeable signs, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.\n\n2. **Fatigue and Weakness**: Patients often report feeling extremely tired and weak, which can significantly impact their daily activities.\n\n3. **Loss of Appetite**: A common symptom is a decreased desire to eat, which can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.\n\n4. **Ascites**: This refers to the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, leading to swelling and discomfort.\n\n5. **Easy Bruising and Bleeding**: Liver failure can impair the liver's ability to produce clotting factors, resulting in a tendency to bruise easily and experience prolonged bleeding.\n\n6. **Itchy Skin**: Patients may experience pruritus, or itchy skin, which can be quite distressing.\n\n7. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: This condition arises from the accumulation of toxins in the blood due to liver dysfunction, leading to symptoms such as confusion, personality changes, muscle jerks, and in severe cases, coma.\n\n8. **Altered Mental Status**: Patients may exhibit confusion or disorientation, which can progress to more severe neurological symptoms.\n\n9. **Swelling in the Legs and Ankles**: This is often due to fluid retention and can be a sign of worsening liver function.\n\n10. **Other Symptoms**: Patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\nThese clinical features can help in diagnosing liver failure and determining its severity. The presence of jaundice, ascites, and altered mental status are particularly significant indicators of liver dysfunction.
