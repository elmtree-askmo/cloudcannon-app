    How are Matching questions structured in the examination?
answer: >-
    Based on the gathered information, the structure of matching questions in the Fiji Year 8 Examination typically involves a set of items that students need to pair correctly. While specific details about the exact format of the matching questions were not provided, it is common for such questions to consist of two columns: one with prompts or statements and the other with corresponding answers or terms. Students are required to match each prompt with the correct answer, often indicated by a letter or number.\n\nFor example, a matching question might present a list of health-related terms in one column and definitions or descriptions in another. Students would then draw lines or write the corresponding letter next to each term to indicate the correct match.\n\nIn the context of the Fiji Year 8 Examination, matching questions are likely designed to assess students' understanding of key concepts in subjects such as Healthy Living, where they may need to connect terms related to health education, personal safety, or non-communicable disease prevention.\n\nIf you need more specific examples or details about the structure of matching questions, I cannot answer this question based on the available information, as the gathered data does not provide explicit examples or formats used in the Fiji Year 8 Examination.
