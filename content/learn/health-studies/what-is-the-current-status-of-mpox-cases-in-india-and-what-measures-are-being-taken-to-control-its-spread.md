    What is the current status of Mpox cases in India, and what measures are being taken to control its spread?
answer: >-
    As of now, India has reported a total of 32 cases of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) since the infection was first detected in the country in 2022, with one confirmed death. The most recent case was detected in March 2024, and it was identified as an isolated, travel-related infection involving a man who had recently traveled from a country experiencing an outbreak.\n\nIn response to the Mpox situation, the Indian government has implemented several measures to control the spread of the virus. The Union Health Ministry has issued advisories to all states and union territories, urging them to enforce strict infection prevention and control measures. This includes the implementation of public health actions, genome sequencing, and raising public awareness about the disease.\n\nAdditionally, the Health Secretary, Apurva Chandra, emphasized the importance of these measures to minimize the spread of Mpox across the nation. The government is closely monitoring the situation and is taking proactive steps to prevent any potential outbreaks.\n\nOverall, while there have been no new cases reported recently, the Indian authorities remain vigilant and are prepared to respond to any future developments related to Mpox.
