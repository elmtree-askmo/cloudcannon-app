    How does methane contribute to climate change?
answer: >-
    Methane (CH₄) is a potent greenhouse gas and plays a significant role in climate change. It is the second-largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide (CO₂). Here are some key points regarding methane's contribution to climate change:\n\n1. **Heat Trapping Ability**: A molecule of methane is much more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere compared to a molecule of carbon dioxide. In fact, over a 20-year period, methane is approximately 80 times more powerful than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas. However, methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifespan of about 7 to 12 years, while CO₂ can persist for hundreds of years.\n\n2. **Sources of Emissions**: Methane emissions come from both natural and anthropogenic (human) sources. Approximately one-third of global methane emissions occur naturally, primarily from wetlands, while two-thirds are attributed to human activities. These activities include oil and gas operations, coal mining, landfills, livestock farming, and rice paddies.\n\n3. **Impact on Global Warming**: Methane is responsible for about 20% of the direct radiative forcing since 1750, which is a measure of its impact on global warming. Its contribution to current global warming is significant, accounting for about a third of the warming observed today.\n\n4. **Air Quality and Ozone Formation**: Methane also affects air quality, as it can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant that poses risks to human health and ecosystems.\n\n5. **Urgency for Mitigation**: Given its potency and the projected rise in methane emissions, scientists and policymakers emphasize the need for aggressive action to reduce methane emissions. It is estimated that global anthropogenic methane emissions could rise by up to 13% between 2020 and 2030 if no action is taken. To align with climate targets, emissions must be reduced by 30-60% below 2020 levels by 2030.\n\nIn summary, methane significantly contributes to climate change due to its high global warming potential and the substantial amount of emissions resulting from human activities. Addressing methane emissions is critical for mitigating climate change and improving air quality.
