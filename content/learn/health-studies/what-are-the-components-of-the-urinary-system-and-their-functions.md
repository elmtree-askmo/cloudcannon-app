    What are the components of the urinary system and their functions?
answer: >-
    The urinary system, also known as the excretory system, is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the body by removing waste products and regulating various physiological parameters. It consists of four main components, each with specific functions:\n\n1. **Kidneys**:\n   - **Function**: The kidneys are the primary organs of the urinary system, responsible for filtering blood to remove waste products and excess substances, thereby producing urine. They play a crucial role in regulating fluid balance, electrolyte levels (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium), and acid-base balance. Additionally, the kidneys have important endocrine functions, including the secretion of:\n     - **Renin**: A hormone that regulates blood pressure.\n     - **Erythropoietin**: A hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in response to low oxygen levels.\n     - **Active form of Vitamin D**: Which helps regulate calcium metabolism.\n\n2. **Ureters**:\n   - **Function**: The ureters are muscular tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. They use peristaltic movements (wave-like muscle contractions) to propel urine downward.\n\n3. **Urinary Bladder**:\n   - **Function**: The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted. It can expand to accommodate varying volumes of urine and contracts during urination to expel urine through the urethra.\n\n4. **Urethra**:\n   - **Function**: The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. In males, it also serves as a passage for semen. The urethra has sphincters that help control the release of urine.\n\nOverall, the urinary system plays a vital role in eliminating metabolic waste, regulating blood volume and pressure, controlling electrolyte levels, and maintaining the pH balance of the blood.
