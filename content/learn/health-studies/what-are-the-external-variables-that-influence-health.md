    What are the external variables that influence health?
answer: >-
    External variables that influence health are often categorized into social, physical, and environmental factors. These variables play a significant role in shaping health outcomes and can be understood through the lens of social determinants of health (SDOH). Here are the key external variables:\n\n1. **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)**: These are non-medical factors that affect health outcomes and include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age. SDOH encompass a wide range of influences, including:\n   - **Economic Stability**: Income level, employment status, and financial resources can significantly impact access to healthcare, nutrition, and overall well-being.\n   - **Education Access and Quality**: Higher levels of education are associated with better health outcomes, as education influences health literacy and access to health information.\n   - **Social and Community Context**: Factors such as social cohesion, community engagement, and the presence of supportive social networks can enhance mental and physical health.\n   - **Health Care Access and Quality**: Availability and quality of healthcare services directly affect health outcomes, including preventive care and treatment for illnesses.\n   - **Neighborhood and Built Environment**: The physical environment, including housing quality, access to healthy foods, and recreational spaces, influences lifestyle choices and health behaviors.\n\n2. **Physical Environmental Factors**: These include:\n   - **Air and Water Quality**: Exposure to pollutants and toxins can lead to various health issues, including respiratory diseases and other chronic conditions.\n   - **Access to Healthy Foods**: Availability of nutritious food options in a community can affect dietary habits and overall health.\n   - **Built Environment**: Urban design, transportation systems, and land use can influence physical activity levels and access to health resources.\n\n3. **Social Environmental Factors**: These factors relate to the social context in which individuals live, including:\n   - **Safety and Violence**: High levels of violence and crime can lead to stress and mental health issues, impacting overall health.\n   - **Social Participation**: Engagement in community activities and social networks can promote mental well-being and provide support systems.\n\n4. **Cultural Factors**: Beliefs, values, and customs of a community can influence health behaviors and attitudes towards health care, impacting overall health outcomes.\n\n5. **Policy and Governance**: Government policies and regulations can shape health outcomes by influencing economic conditions, access to healthcare, and environmental protections.\n\nUnderstanding these external variables is crucial for developing effective health promotion and illness prevention strategies, as they highlight the importance of addressing the broader social and environmental contexts that affect health.
