    What is the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) and how does it relate to health workers?
answer: >-
    The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) is a classification system developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to organize and categorize occupational information. The current version, known as ISCO-08, was published in 2008 and represents the fourth iteration of this classification system, following ISCO-58, ISCO-68, and ISCO-88. ISCO is part of the broader family of economic and social classifications used by the United Nations.\n\nIn relation to health workers, the ISCO provides a structured framework for classifying various health occupations based on skill level and specialization. Health workers are mapped to the ISCO in a hierarchical structure, which facilitates the aggregation and comparison of occupational data across different countries and contexts. This classification is essential for collecting and analyzing data from population censuses, surveys, and administrative records, thereby improving the comparability of health worker data globally.\n\nThe ISCO-08 specifically includes detailed categories for health worker occupations, allowing for a standardized approach to understanding the health workforce. This classification is crucial for global health workforce management, as it helps in identifying workforce needs, planning training and qualifications, and implementing health worker classification systems effectively. By using ISCO, health organizations and policymakers can ensure that data on health workers is consistent and useful for research and decision-making purposes.
