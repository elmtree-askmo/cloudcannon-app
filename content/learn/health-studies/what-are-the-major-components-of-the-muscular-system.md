    What are the major components of the muscular system?
answer: >-
    The muscular system is a complex organ system that plays a vital role in various bodily functions, including movement, posture maintenance, and circulation. It consists of three major types of muscle tissue:\n\n1. **Skeletal Muscle**: This type of muscle is attached to bones and is responsible for voluntary movements. Skeletal muscles are striated in appearance and are under conscious control, allowing for precise movements. There are approximately 650 skeletal muscles in the human body, including major muscles such as the biceps brachii, deltoid, and quadriceps.\n\n2. **Smooth Muscle**: Found in the walls of hollow organs (such as the intestines and blood vessels), smooth muscle is involuntary and not under conscious control. It is non-striated and helps facilitate processes such as digestion and blood circulation by contracting and relaxing.\n\n3. **Cardiac Muscle**: This specialized muscle tissue makes up the heart. Cardiac muscle is also involuntary and striated, and it has the unique ability to contract autonomously, allowing the heart to pump blood continuously without conscious effort.\n\nIn addition to these muscle types, the muscular system is characterized by muscle cells (myocytes) that contain myofibrils made up of proteins such as actin and myosin. These proteins are essential for muscle contraction, enabling movement and various bodily functions.\n\nOverall, the muscular system is integral to maintaining posture, facilitating locomotion, and supporting vital functions such as circulation and digestion.
