    How is blood pressure measured and what does it indicate?
answer: >-
    Blood pressure is measured to assess the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, particularly arteries, as the heart pumps. This measurement is expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and consists of two numbers: systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n\n1. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: This is the first (higher) number and indicates the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pumps blood. For example, in a reading of 132/88 mmHg, the systolic pressure is 132 mmHg.\n\n2. **Diastolic Blood Pressure**: This is the second (lower) number and measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats. In the same example, the diastolic pressure is 88 mmHg.\n\nBlood pressure readings are categorized into different stages to assess an individual's cardiovascular health:\n- **Normal**: Systolic < 120 mmHg and Diastolic < 80 mmHg\n- **Elevated**: Systolic 120-129 mmHg and Diastolic < 80 mmHg\n- **Hypertension Stage 1**: Systolic 130-139 mmHg or Diastolic 80-89 mmHg\n- **Hypertension Stage 2**: Systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or Diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg\n\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, is a significant risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes. Regular monitoring of blood pressure can help in early detection and management of these conditions.\n\nTo measure blood pressure, healthcare providers often use a sphygmomanometer, which can be either manual or automatic. The measurement process involves placing a cuff around the upper arm, inflating it to restrict blood flow, and then gradually releasing the pressure while listening for specific sounds (Korotkoff sounds) that indicate systolic and diastolic pressures.\n\nIn summary, blood pressure measurement is a crucial tool in assessing cardiovascular health, helping to identify potential health risks and guiding treatment decisions.
