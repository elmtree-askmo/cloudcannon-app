answer: >-
    The study on repeated sprint performance and its physiological implications references several key works to support its findings and conclusions. Here are some notable references mentioned in the gathered information:\n\n1. **Bishop D., Girard O.** - This reference is likely related to the physiological responses and performance metrics in repeated sprint tests, emphasizing the importance of understanding fatigue and recovery patterns.\n\n2. **Giacomoni et al. (2006)** - This study is significant as it utilized an indoor repeated-sprint test and found no diurnal variation in repeated-sprint performance, contributing to the understanding of fatigue and recovery dynamics.\n\n3. **Brizendine et al. (2013)** and **Erickson et al. (2013)** - These studies focus on metabolic recovery and the effects of endurance training on recovery kinetics, which are crucial for understanding the metabolic processes involved in repeated sprints.\n\n4. **Ambrozic, G., Udovc, G., and Krusic, P. (2018)** - This reference discusses the metabolic changes induced by endurance events, which is relevant for understanding recovery mechanisms post-exercise.\n\n5. **Additional studies** - The gathered information mentions a total of 56 references, indicating a comprehensive review of literature that includes observational and experimental studies on recovery strategies in endurance athletes.\n\nThese references collectively provide a robust foundation for the study's conclusions regarding the physiological adaptations in sprinters and endurance runners, the importance of anaerobic energy supply, and the implications for training practices in athletes. Future research directions may also be informed by these foundational studies, particularly in exploring the nuances of metabolic recovery and performance metrics in team sports.
