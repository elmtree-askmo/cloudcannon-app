    How do exopeptidases contribute to the breakdown of polypeptides?
answer: >-
    Exopeptidases play a crucial role in the breakdown of polypeptides during protein digestion. These enzymes are responsible for cleaving amino acids from the ends of peptide chains, which is essential for converting longer polypeptides into smaller peptides and ultimately into free amino acids that can be absorbed by the body.\n\n### Mechanism of Action\n\n1. **Cleavage of Terminal Amino Acids**: Exopeptidases can be classified into two main types:\n   - **Carboxypeptidases**: These enzymes remove amino acids from the carboxyl (C-terminal) end of the peptide chain.\n   - **Aminopeptidases**: These enzymes remove amino acids from the amino (N-terminal) end of the peptide chain.\n\n2. **Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds**: The action of exopeptidases involves the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, which can be represented by the general reaction:\n   $$\n   \text{Peptide} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Amino Acid}_1 + \text{Amino Acid}_2 + \ldots\n   $$\n   This reaction is essential for breaking down peptides into their constituent amino acids.\n\n3. **Final Stages of Protein Digestion**: Exopeptidases act in the final stages of protein digestion, following the action of endopeptidases, which cleave peptide bonds within the protein chain. By removing terminal amino acids, exopeptidases facilitate the conversion of peptides into dipeptides and free amino acids.\n\n### Importance in Absorption\n\nThe free amino acids produced by the action of exopeptidases are then available for absorption by the intestinal epithelial cells. This process is vital for providing the body with the necessary building blocks for protein synthesis and other metabolic functions.\n\nIn summary, exopeptidases are essential enzymes in the digestive process, enabling the efficient breakdown of polypeptides into absorbable amino acids, thereby playing a key role in protein digestion and nutrient absorption.
