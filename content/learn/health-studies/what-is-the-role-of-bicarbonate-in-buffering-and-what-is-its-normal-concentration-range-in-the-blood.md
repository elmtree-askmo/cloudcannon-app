    What is the role of bicarbonate in buffering, and what is its normal concentration range in the blood?
answer: >-
    Bicarbonate (HCO3-) plays a vital role in buffering and maintaining acid-base balance in the body. It acts as a base that neutralizes excess acids, thereby helping to stabilize the pH levels in the blood. The primary buffering system in the bloodstream is the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffering system, which is crucial for regulating pH and is often assessed through arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.\n\nThe normal concentration range of bicarbonate in arterial blood is typically between 22 and 26 mEq/L. This range is essential for effective buffering; deviations from this range can indicate underlying metabolic disturbances. For instance, in metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate levels may decrease as the body attempts to buffer excess hydrogen ions produced from various metabolic processes.\n\nIn summary, bicarbonate serves as a key component in the body's buffering systems, helping to maintain pH homeostasis, with a normal concentration range of 22 to 26 mEq/L in the blood.
