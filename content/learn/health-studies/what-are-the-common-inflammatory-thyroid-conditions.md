    What are the common inflammatory thyroid conditions?
answer: >-
    Common inflammatory thyroid conditions primarily include various forms of thyroiditis, which is characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most notable types of thyroiditis are:\n\n1. **Hashimoto's Thyroiditis**: This is the most prevalent form of thyroiditis and is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, often leading to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). It can result in permanent thyroid dysfunction.\n\n2. **Graves' Disease**: Although primarily known as a cause of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), Graves' disease is also an autoimmune condition that can lead to inflammation of the thyroid.\n\n3. **Subacute Thyroiditis**: This type is often triggered by viral infections and is characterized by a painful swelling of the thyroid gland. It typically follows a course of hyperthyroidism that may transition to hypothyroidism before returning to normal function.\n\n4. **Painless Thyroiditis**: Similar to subacute thyroiditis but without pain, this condition can occur postpartum or in individuals without any identifiable cause. It usually presents with a phase of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism.\n\n5. **Acute Thyroiditis**: This is a rare form of thyroiditis that can occur due to bacterial infections, leading to severe inflammation and often requiring antibiotic treatment.\n\nThese inflammatory conditions can lead to various symptoms, including fatigue, weight changes, and alterations in thyroid hormone levels. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels and antibodies, along with imaging studies if necessary. Treatment varies depending on the specific type of thyroiditis and may include medication to manage hormone levels or, in some cases, surgery.
