    How are Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals categorized?
answer: >-
    Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals are categorized under the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) as Unit Group 3230. This classification includes occupations that require a less extensive understanding of health practices, typically based on relatively short periods of formal or informal education and training. These professionals often acquire their skills informally through the traditions and practices of the communities where they originate.\n\nThe ISCO-08 framework, which is the latest version of the classification, provides a structured approach to categorizing health workers, including those in traditional and complementary medicine. This classification is part of a broader effort to enhance the comparability of health worker data across different countries and over time, facilitating better workforce management and planning in the health sector.\n\nIn summary, Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals fall under the ISCO classification as follows:\n\n- **Unit Group**: 3230 - Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals\n- **Characteristics**: Require less extensive education and training, often based on community traditions and practices. \n\nThis classification helps in understanding the role and scope of these professionals within the health workforce globally.
