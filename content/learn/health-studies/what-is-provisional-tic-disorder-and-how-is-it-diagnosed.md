    What is Provisional Tic Disorder and how is it diagnosed?
answer: >-
    Provisional Tic Disorder, previously known as transient tic disorder, is characterized by the presence of one or more motor or vocal tics that occur for less than one year. This condition is the most common type of tic disorder, affecting up to 10% of children in their early school years. \n\n### Diagnosis\nTo diagnose provisional tic disorder, healthcare providers follow specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The key diagnostic criteria include:\n\n1. **Presence of Tics**: The individual must exhibit one or more motor tics (such as blinking or shoulder shrugging) or vocal tics (such as humming or throat clearing).\n2. **Duration**: The tics must have been present for less than 12 months.\n3. **Age of Onset**: The tics must have emerged before the individual reaches 18 years of age.\n4. **Exclusion of Other Disorders**: The individual should not have been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome (TS) or persistent motor or vocal tic disorder.\n\nThe diagnosis is primarily clinical, relying on a comprehensive clinical history gathered from reliable sources, often including parents or caregivers. It is important to note that treatment for provisional tic disorder is typically only necessary if the tics interfere with the child's daily activities or self-image. \n\nIn summary, provisional tic disorder is a temporary condition that can significantly impact children, but with appropriate diagnosis and, if necessary, treatment, many can manage their symptoms effectively.
