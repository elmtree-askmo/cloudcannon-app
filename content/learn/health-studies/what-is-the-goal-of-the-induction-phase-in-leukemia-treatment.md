    What is the goal of the induction phase in leukemia treatment?
answer: >-
    The goal of the induction phase in leukemia treatment is to achieve remission by rapidly eliminating leukemia cells from the patient's body. This phase is critical, especially in cases of acute leukemia, where the presence of a high number of abnormal white blood cells can severely impact the patient's health. \n\nDuring the induction phase, intensive chemotherapy is typically administered to target and destroy these malignant cells. The aim is to reduce the leukemia cell count to a level where normal blood cell production can resume, thereby restoring the patient's hematologic function. Successful induction leads to a state of remission, where no evidence of leukemia is detectable in the blood or bone marrow.\n\nFollowing the induction phase, patients usually enter the consolidation phase, which aims to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells and further reduce the risk of relapse. This structured approach is essential for improving long-term outcomes in leukemia patients. \n\nIn summary, the induction phase is a crucial first step in the multi-phase treatment strategy for leukemia, focusing on achieving rapid remission and setting the stage for subsequent treatment phases.
