    What are the different types of cells found in the nervous system?
answer: >-
    The nervous system is primarily composed of two main types of cells: neurons and glial cells (also known as neuroglia). \n\n### Neurons\nNeurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system responsible for transmitting nerve impulses. They are electrically active cells that communicate with each other and with other types of cells through electrochemical signals. Neurons can be classified into three main types based on their function:\n\n1. **Sensory Neurons**: These neurons detect changes in the environment (stimuli) and transmit signals from sensory receptors to the central nervous system (CNS).\n2. **Motor Neurons**: These neurons convey signals from the CNS to muscles and glands, facilitating movement and responses.\n3. **Interneurons**: These neurons connect various neurons within the CNS, playing a crucial role in processing information and reflexes.\n\n### Glial Cells\nGlial cells serve as supporting cells in the nervous system. They outnumber neurons and perform several essential functions, including:\n\n- **Astrocytes**: These star-shaped cells provide structural support, regulate blood flow, and maintain the chemical environment around neurons.\n- **Microglia**: These are the immune cells of the CNS, responsible for removing waste and protecting against pathogens.\n- **Ependymal Cells**: These cells line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord, involved in the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid.\n- **Oligodendrocytes**: These cells form the myelin sheath around axons in the CNS, which is crucial for the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, a similar type of glial cell called **Schwann cells** also produces myelin sheaths around neuronal axons.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the nervous system consists of neurons, which are responsible for communication and processing information, and glial cells, which support and protect neurons, ensuring their proper function. Understanding the roles of these cells is vital for comprehending how the nervous system operates and maintains health.
