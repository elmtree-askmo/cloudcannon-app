    What are the major bones in the legs and their functions?
answer: >-
    The major bones in the legs include the femur, tibia, fibula, and patella, each serving distinct functions:\n\n1. **Femur**: The femur, or thigh bone, is the longest bone in the human body. It connects the pelvis to the knee and plays a crucial role in supporting the weight of the body during activities such as walking, running, and jumping. It also provides attachment points for various muscles that facilitate movement.\n\n2. **Tibia**: Known as the shin bone, the tibia is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the lower leg. It is the primary weight-bearing bone and articulates with the femur to form the knee joint. The tibia also connects with the fibula and the talus at the ankle joint, contributing to stability and movement.\n\n3. **Fibula**: The fibula is a thinner bone located on the lateral side of the leg. While it does not bear significant weight, it plays a secondary role in the articulation of the ankle joint and provides attachment points for muscles. The fibula articulates with the tibia at two locations, contributing to the overall stability of the leg.\n\n4. **Patella**: Commonly known as the kneecap, the patella is a small, flat bone that sits atop the knee joint. It serves to protect the knee and enhances the leverage of the quadriceps tendon, allowing for more efficient movement during knee flexion and extension.\n\nTogether, these bones form the structure of the leg, enabling a wide range of movements while supporting the body's weight. The coordination of these bones and their associated muscles is essential for activities such as standing, walking, and running.
