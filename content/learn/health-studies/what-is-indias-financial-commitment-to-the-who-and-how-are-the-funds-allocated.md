    What is India's financial commitment to the WHO and how are the funds allocated?
answer: >-
    India's financial commitment to the World Health Organization (WHO) is primarily focused on supporting the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre. In a significant agreement signed in Geneva, the Government of India pledged a total of $85 million over a span of ten years, from 2022 to 2032. This funding is aimed at enhancing the evidence base for traditional medicine practices, which are utilized by billions of people worldwide for their health and well-being.\n\nThe allocation of these funds is structured to support a cross-sectoral program that will strengthen the evidence surrounding traditional medicine. A substantial portion of this commitment, amounting to $250 million, is specifically designated for establishing a Centre of Excellence for Traditional Medicine. This initiative reflects India's dedication to integrating traditional healthcare systems into global health frameworks.\n\nIn addition to this commitment, the WHO's overall financing includes both assessed contributions and voluntary contributions from member states, philanthropic foundations, and other sources. India's contribution is part of a broader effort to address the funding gap in global health initiatives, which currently stands at approximately $7.1 billion, with WHO having secured pledges exceeding $2.2 billion.\n\nOverall, India's financial commitment to the WHO underscores its role in promoting traditional medicine and enhancing global health standards through evidence-based practices.
