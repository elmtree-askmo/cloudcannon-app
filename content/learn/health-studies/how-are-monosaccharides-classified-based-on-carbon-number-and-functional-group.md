    How are monosaccharides classified based on carbon number and functional group?
answer: >-
    Monosaccharides are classified based on two primary criteria: the number of carbon atoms they contain and the type of functional group present. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these classifications:\n\n### 1. Classification by Number of Carbon Atoms\nMonosaccharides can be categorized according to the number of carbon atoms in their structure:\n\n- **Trioses**: Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms (C3H6O3). An example is glyceraldehyde.\n- **Tetroses**: Monosaccharides with four carbon atoms (C4H8O4). An example is erythrose.\n- **Pentoses**: Monosaccharides with five carbon atoms (C5H10O5). Common examples include ribose and xylose.\n- **Hexoses**: Monosaccharides with six carbon atoms (C6H12O6). Well-known examples are glucose, fructose, and galactose.\n- **Heptoses**: Monosaccharides with seven carbon atoms (C7H14O7). An example is sedoheptulose.\n\n### 2. Classification by Functional Group\nMonosaccharides can also be classified based on the location of the carbonyl group (C=O):\n\n- **Aldoses**: These monosaccharides contain an aldehyde group at the end of the carbon chain. For example, glucose is an aldose.\n- **Ketoses**: These monosaccharides contain a ketone group, typically located at the second carbon atom. An example is fructose, which is a ketose.\n\n### 3. Ring Structure\nIn addition to the above classifications, monosaccharides can exist in different structural forms, particularly in aqueous solutions:\n\n- **Alpha (α) and Beta (β) Forms**: When monosaccharides cyclize to form ring structures, they can adopt two different configurations based on the orientation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the first carbon. In the α form, the hydroxyl group is positioned below the plane of the ring, while in the β form, it is above the plane.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, monosaccharides are classified based on:\n- The number of carbon atoms (trioses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, heptoses).\n- The type of carbonyl group (aldoses or ketoses).\n- The ring structure (alpha or beta forms).\n\nThis classification is essential for understanding the structure and function of these simple sugars, which serve as the building blocks for more complex carbohydrates and play vital roles in biological processes.
