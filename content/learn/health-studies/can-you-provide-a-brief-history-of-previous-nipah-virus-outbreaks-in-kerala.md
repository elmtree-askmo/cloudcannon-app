    Can you provide a brief history of previous Nipah Virus outbreaks in Kerala?
answer: >-
    The Nipah virus (NiV) has caused several outbreaks in Kerala, India, since its first reported case in the state in 2018. Here is a brief history of these outbreaks:\n\n1. **2018 Outbreak**: The first Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala was reported on May 19, 2018, in the Kozhikode district. This outbreak resulted in 18 confirmed cases and 17 deaths by June 1, 2018. The outbreak was traced back to fruit bats, which are known carriers of the virus.\n\n2. **2019 Outbreak**: Following the 2018 outbreak, a second outbreak occurred in June 2019 in the Kochi district. This outbreak prompted health authorities to enhance their response strategies based on lessons learned from the previous year.\n\n3. **2021 Outbreak**: On September 1, 2021, a 12-year-old boy was confirmed to have Nipah virus encephalitis after visiting a hospital in Kozhikode. He succumbed to the illness shortly after diagnosis, marking another significant incident in the region.\n\n4. **2023 Outbreak**: The most recent outbreak occurred in September 2023, marking the sixth outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala. During this outbreak, two fatalities were reported, and the virus was isolated from patients with epidemiological links to a probable case. This outbreak highlighted ongoing concerns regarding the virus's transmission and the need for effective health policies and preparedness.\n\nOverall, Kerala has experienced multiple outbreaks of Nipah virus since 2018, with a total of 21 reported deaths linked to the virus between 2018 and 2024. The state has been actively working to understand the epidemiology of the virus and improve its health response systems to manage future outbreaks effectively.
