    Which domestic agencies are involved in regulating seafood in the U.S., and what are their roles?
answer: >-
    In the United States, several domestic agencies are involved in regulating seafood, each with specific roles and responsibilities:\n\n1. **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: The FDA is the primary federal agency responsible for ensuring the safety of seafood products. It operates a mandatory safety program under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA requires seafood processors to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems to prevent food safety hazards. The agency also conducts foreign country assessments to ensure that imported aquaculture products meet U.S. safety standards.\n\n2. **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**: NOAA Fisheries plays a crucial role in the sustainable management of U.S. fisheries. It develops regulations for marine fishery management in federal waters, primarily under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. NOAA works with regional fishery management councils and other partners to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and the health of marine ecosystems.\n\n3. **Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)**: APHIS is involved in protecting U.S. agricultural health, which includes overseeing the importation of live animals and aquaculture products. The agency ensures that these products do not introduce diseases or pests that could harm U.S. agriculture.\n\n4. **National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)**: NIFA supports aquaculture research, education, and technology transfer to enhance U.S. aquaculture production. It addresses national needs and promotes sustainable practices within the aquaculture industry.\n\n5. **State Agencies**: Each state has its own regulatory framework to ensure the safety of seafood products harvested, processed, and sold within its jurisdiction. State agencies manage fisheries in freshwater and coastal waters up to three miles from shore, implementing regulations that complement federal laws.\n\n6. **Department of the Interior**: This department oversees policies related to fish and wildlife management, promoting cooperative relationships among federal and state agencies to ensure effective management of aquatic resources.\n\nThese agencies work collaboratively to ensure that seafood products in the U.S. are safe, sustainable, and of high quality, addressing both domestic and imported seafood.
