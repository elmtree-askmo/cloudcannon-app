    What is the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme and its objectives?
answer: >-
    The Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme, officially known as the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), is a flagship health protection initiative launched by the Government of India in 2018. The scheme aims to provide universal health coverage to the poor and vulnerable sections of society, ensuring access to quality healthcare services regardless of economic status.\n\n### Objectives of the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme:\n\n1. **Universal Health Coverage**: The primary objective is to cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) by providing health insurance coverage of up to ₹5 lakh (approximately $7,000) per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization.\n\n2. **Reduction of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure**: The scheme aims to significantly reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses for healthcare, thereby increasing access to quality medical services and reducing the financial burden on families.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Healthcare Services**: Ayushman Bharat promotes a holistic approach to healthcare, encompassing preventive, promotive, curative, palliative, and rehabilitative services. It aims to strengthen the healthcare system at all levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\n4. **Inclusivity**: The scheme is designed to be inclusive, with no restrictions on family size, age, or gender. It covers all pre-existing medical conditions and provides benefits for three days of pre-hospitalization and 15 days of post-hospitalization care, including diagnostic services and medication.\n\n5. **Portability**: Beneficiaries can avail themselves of medical treatment at any empaneled hospital across the country, making the scheme portable and accessible.\n\n6. **Focus on Vulnerable Populations**: The scheme targets specific groups identified through the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), including families without shelter, manual scavengers, and certain occupational categories of urban workers.\n\n7. **Implementation Across India**: The Ayushman Bharat scheme is being rolled out across all states and union territories, with the goal of covering all targeted beneficiaries.\n\n### Features of the Scheme:\n\n- **Cashless and Paperless Transactions**: The scheme facilitates cashless payments and maintains paperless records through hospitals and healthcare providers.\n- **Empanelment of Hospitals**: Both public and private hospitals are empaneled under the scheme to provide services to beneficiaries.\n- **Access to Free COVID-19 Testing**: The scheme also includes provisions for free COVID-19 testing.\n\n### Challenges:\n\nDespite its ambitious goals, the Ayushman Bharat scheme faces challenges, including the need for improved healthcare infrastructure, chronic underfunding of the public health sector, and disparities in access to healthcare services. There have also been reports of fraudulent claims and potential biases in coverage.\n\nIn summary, the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme represents a significant step towards achieving universal health coverage in India, aiming to provide essential healthcare services to the most vulnerable populations while addressing systemic challenges in the healthcare system.
