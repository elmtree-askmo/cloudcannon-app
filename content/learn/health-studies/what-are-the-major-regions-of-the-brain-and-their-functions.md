    What are the major regions of the brain and their functions?
answer: >-
    The human brain is a complex organ that can be divided into several major regions, each with distinct functions. Here are the primary regions of the brain and their associated functions:\n\n1. **Cerebrum**: This is the largest part of the brain and is divided into two hemispheres (left and right). The cerebrum is responsible for higher brain functions, including thought, action, and sensory processing. It contains four main lobes:\n   - **Frontal Lobe**: Located at the front of the brain, it is involved in decision-making, problem-solving, control of behavior, and voluntary movement.\n   - **Parietal Lobe**: Positioned behind the frontal lobe, it processes sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain. It also plays a role in spatial orientation and body awareness.\n   - **Temporal Lobe**: Found on the sides of the head, it is crucial for processing auditory information and is also involved in memory and emotion.\n   - **Occipital Lobe**: Located at the back of the head, it is primarily responsible for visual processing.\n\n2. **Cerebellum**: Situated beneath the cerebrum, the cerebellum is essential for coordination, balance, and fine motor control. It helps adjust body movements and is involved in learning motor skills.\n\n3. **Brainstem**: This region connects the brain to the spinal cord and is responsible for regulating vital involuntary functions such as heartbeat, breathing, and reflexes. The brainstem includes:\n   - **Midbrain**: Involved in vision, hearing, and motor control.\n   - **Pons**: Plays a role in regulating breathing and relaying signals between different parts of the brain.\n   - **Medulla Oblongata**: Controls autonomic functions like heart rate and blood pressure.\n\n4. **Limbic System**: This system is involved in emotions, memory, and motivation. Key structures within the limbic system include:\n   - **Hypothalamus**: Regulates homeostasis, including hunger, thirst, temperature, and circadian rhythms.\n   - **Amygdala**: Plays a key role in processing emotions, particularly fear and pleasure.\n   - **Hippocampus**: Essential for memory formation and spatial navigation.\n\n5. **Diencephalon**: This region includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a relay station for sensory information, while the hypothalamus regulates various autonomic functions and hormonal activities.\n\nThese regions work together to enable complex behaviors, cognitive functions, and physiological processes, making the brain a vital organ for human life. Understanding the anatomy and functions of these brain regions is crucial for developing treatments for neurological conditions and enhancing our knowledge of human behavior and cognition.
