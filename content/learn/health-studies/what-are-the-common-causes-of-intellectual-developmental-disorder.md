    What are the common causes of Intellectual Developmental Disorder?
answer: >-
    Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), commonly referred to as intellectual disability, can arise from a variety of causes that can be classified into three main categories: pre-birth, birth, and early childhood factors.\n\n1. **Pre-birth Factors**: These include genetic and environmental influences that occur during pregnancy. Some of the most common known causes of intellectual disability in this category are:\n   - **Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)**: This is a preventable cause of intellectual disability resulting from alcohol exposure during pregnancy.\n   - **Genetic and Chromosomal Conditions**: Conditions such as Down syndrome (caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21) and fragile X syndrome are significant contributors.\n   - **Infections During Pregnancy**: Certain infections, such as rubella, can adversely affect fetal development.\n\n2. **Birth Factors**: Complications during the birthing process can also lead to intellectual disabilities. These may include:\n   - **Birth Asphyxia**: Lack of oxygen during delivery can result in brain damage.\n   - **Premature Birth**: Being born prematurely can increase the risk of developmental issues.\n\n3. **Early Childhood Factors**: Environmental influences after birth can contribute to the development of intellectual disabilities. These may include:\n   - **Lead Poisoning**: Exposure to lead can have detrimental effects on cognitive development.\n   - **Severe Malnutrition**: Lack of essential nutrients during critical periods of brain development can lead to lasting impairments.\n\nIt is important to note that in many cases, multiple factors may interact to contribute to the development of intellectual disability. The etiology of IDD is complex and not fully understood, with both genetic and environmental factors playing significant roles. Early diagnosis and intervention can be crucial in managing the effects of these disorders and improving outcomes for affected individuals.
