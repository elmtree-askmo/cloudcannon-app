    What constitutes the external genitalia in females?
answer: >-
    The external genitalia in females, collectively referred to as the vulva, consist of several key structures that play important roles in both the reproductive and urinary systems. The components of the external female genitalia include:\n\n1. **Mons Pubis**: A pad of fatty tissue located over the pubic bone, which becomes covered with pubic hair after puberty.\n2. **Labia Majora**: The larger, outer folds of skin that protect the other external structures.\n3. **Labia Minora**: The smaller, inner folds of skin that lie within the labia majora and can vary significantly in size, color, and structure among individuals.\n4. **Clitoris**: A small, sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva, which is important for sexual arousal.\n5. **Vestibule**: The area enclosed by the labia minora that contains the openings to the urethra and vagina.\n6. **Hymen**: A thin membrane that partially covers the vaginal opening in some individuals.\n7. **Vestibular Bulb**: A pair of erectile tissues located on either side of the vaginal opening, contributing to sexual arousal.\n8. **Vestibular Glands (Bartholin's Glands)**: Glands that secrete mucus to lubricate the vaginal opening.\n\nThese structures occupy a significant portion of the female perineum and are essential for various functions, including sexual pleasure, reproduction, and the protection of internal genital organs. The appearance and size of these components can vary widely among individuals, reflecting the diversity of female anatomy.
