    What are the main objectives of the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme?
answer: >-
    The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) is a flagship health protection scheme launched by the Government of India on September 23, 2018. Its main objectives are as follows:\n\n1. **Universal Health Coverage**: The scheme aims to provide universal health coverage to the poor and vulnerable sections of society, ensuring access to quality healthcare services regardless of economic status.\n\n2. **Financial Protection**: PM-JAY offers a health cover of up to â‚¹5 lakhs (approximately $7,000) per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. This financial protection is designed to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for families, thereby alleviating the financial burden associated with medical treatments.\n\n3. **Access to Quality Healthcare**: The scheme seeks to improve access to quality healthcare services for identified families, facilitating cashless treatment at empaneled hospitals, which include both public and private facilities.\n\n4. **Coverage of Pre-existing Conditions**: All pre-existing medical conditions are covered under the scheme, ensuring that beneficiaries receive necessary medical care without discrimination based on their health history.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Benefits**: PM-JAY covers a wide range of medical services, including three days of pre-hospitalization and 15 days of post-hospitalization care, which encompasses diagnostic tests and expenses on medicines.\n\n6. **Inclusivity**: There are no restrictions on family size, age, or gender for eligibility, making the scheme accessible to a broad demographic.\n\n7. **Portability**: Beneficiaries can avail medical treatment at any PM-JAY empaneled hospital across the country, enhancing the scheme's flexibility and reach.\n\n8. **Addressing Health Disparities**: By targeting economically vulnerable families, the scheme aims to address health disparities and improve overall health outcomes in the population.\n\nOverall, Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is positioned as the largest health assurance scheme in the world, with the potential to transform the healthcare landscape in India by providing essential health services to millions of people who previously lacked access to affordable healthcare.
