    What are the causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis?
answer: >-
    The causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis are certain species of the genus **Leishmania**. This genus includes various species that are responsible for the disease, which is characterized by the formation of ulcers at the site of infection. The transmission of these parasites occurs through the bite of infected **sandflies**, which are the vectors for the disease.\n\nThe primary species of Leishmania associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis include:\n\n1. **Leishmania major** - Commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.\n2. **Leishmania tropica** - Typically associated with urban areas in the Middle East and parts of Africa.\n3. **Leishmania braziliensis** - While primarily known for causing mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, it can also cause cutaneous forms.\n4. **Leishmania panamensis** - Found in Central and South America, it can lead to cutaneous leishmaniasis as well.\n\nThese species exhibit a life cycle that involves both the sandfly vector and mammalian hosts, which are typically warm-blooded animals, including humans. The disease is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, where the environmental conditions favor the breeding of sandflies.\n\nIn summary, cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by specific species of the Leishmania genus, transmitted by sandflies, leading to skin lesions and ulcers.
