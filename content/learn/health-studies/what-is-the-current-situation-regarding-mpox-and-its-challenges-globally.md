    What is the current situation regarding Mpox and its challenges globally?
answer: >-
    The current situation regarding Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) presents a complex global health challenge. The ongoing outbreak, which began in 2022, is primarily caused by clade II of the Mpox virus, while a separate outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa is linked to clade I. As of late 2023, the number of monthly laboratory-confirmed Mpox cases worldwide has fluctuated between 500 and 1,000, with the Western Pacific Region reporting the highest number of cases, followed by the Americas, Europe, and South-East Asia.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Mpox is endemic, there have been over 22,000 suspected cases and more than 1,200 deaths reported since January 2023. This highlights the severe impact of the disease in regions where it is traditionally present.\n\nThe epidemiology of Mpox has shifted, with a notable increase in human-to-human transmission, particularly among gay and bisexual men and transgender individuals. This has raised significant human rights concerns, as the outbreak has been perceived as being neglected by policymakers, leading to calls for a more inclusive and rights-based approach to epidemic responses.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan aimed at preventing and controlling Mpox outbreaks. This includes enhancing surveillance, accelerating vaccine development and deployment, and ensuring coordinated efforts at global, regional, and national levels. To date, more than 200,000 vaccine doses have been delivered to the DRC, with additional doses on the way.\n\nDespite these efforts, challenges remain, including the need for improved public health infrastructure, equitable access to vaccines, and addressing the stigma associated with the disease. The WHO continues to work with partners to strengthen health systems and ensure that vulnerable populations receive the necessary support and resources to combat Mpox effectively.\n\nOverall, while there have been efforts to manage and mitigate the Mpox outbreak, ongoing vigilance and a comprehensive approach are essential to address the multifaceted challenges it presents globally.
