    What are the main risk factors for developing DKA?
answer: >-
    The main risk factors for developing Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) include:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: Individuals with type 1 diabetes are at the highest risk due to their complete lack of insulin production.\n\n2. **Missed Insulin Doses**: Skipping or not taking prescribed insulin can lead to insufficient insulin levels, precipitating DKA.\n\n3. **Infections**: Illnesses or infections can increase insulin requirements and lead to hyperglycemia, which may trigger DKA.\n\n4. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can elevate blood glucose levels and insulin needs, increasing the risk of DKA.\n\n5. **Undiagnosed Diabetes**: Individuals who have undiagnosed diabetes may present with DKA as their first symptom.\n\n6. **Poor Adherence to Diabetes Management Plans**: Lack of compliance with dietary recommendations, medication regimens, and monitoring can contribute to the development of DKA.\n\n7. **Lack of Access to Healthcare**: Limited access to medical care can hinder timely management of diabetes and increase the risk of complications like DKA.\n\n8. **Certain Medications**: Some medications can affect insulin action or increase blood glucose levels, contributing to the risk of DKA.\n\n9. **Age Factors**: Adolescents and the elderly may face unique challenges in diabetes management, making them more susceptible to DKA.\n\nThese risk factors highlight the importance of proper diabetes management, regular monitoring, and prompt treatment of any infections or stressors to prevent the onset of DKA.
