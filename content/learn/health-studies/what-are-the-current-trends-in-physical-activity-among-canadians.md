    What are the current trends in physical activity among Canadians?
answer: >-
    Current trends in physical activity among Canadians reflect a complex interplay of factors influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, demographic variations, and evolving public health guidelines. Here are some key insights based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **General Participation Rates**: As of 2023, approximately 45% of Canadian adults meet the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. However, this statistic varies significantly across different demographic groups, indicating disparities in physical activity levels.\n\n2. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic has had a profound effect on physical activity patterns. During the initial months of the pandemic, outdoor exercise saw an increase among adults aged 25 and older. However, this was accompanied by a rise in screen time, with 60% of adults reporting increased screen usage. The restrictions imposed to control the virus limited opportunities for physical activity, particularly affecting youth and leading to a notable decline in activity levels among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, which dropped by 14 percentage points.\n\n3. **Children's Activity Levels**: In 2019, over 81% of children aged 5 to 11 participated in some moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the previous week, but only about 35% met the guideline of at least 60 minutes of such activity per day. This suggests that while many children are active, a significant portion does not meet recommended activity levels.\n\n4. **Socio-Ecological Factors**: The social climate surrounding physical activity in Canada is evolving. In 2023, individuals reported a 17% higher likelihood of disagreeing with the notion that society disapproves of physical inactivity compared to previous years. This shift may indicate changing social norms regarding physical activity.\n\n5. **Health Disparities**: There are notable health disparities linked to physical activity levels. For instance, individuals in lower income brackets report higher incidences of chronic health conditions, which may be exacerbated by lower levels of physical activity. \n\n6. **Public Health Recommendations**: The 2023 edition of the Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour and Sleep (PASS) Indicators reflects updated Canadian physical activity recommendations, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to increase participation across various demographics.\n\nIn summary, while there are positive trends in outdoor exercise and awareness of physical activity's importance, challenges remain, particularly among youth and lower-income populations. Addressing these disparities through targeted public health initiatives and community support will be crucial for improving overall physical activity levels in Canada.
