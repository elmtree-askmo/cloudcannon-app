    What are the functions of tendons and ligaments in the musculoskeletal system?
answer: >-
    Tendons and ligaments are essential components of the musculoskeletal system, each serving distinct but complementary functions that contribute to movement and stability.\n\n### Functions of Tendons\nTendons are dense fibrous tissues that connect muscles to bones. Their primary functions include:\n\n1. **Force Transmission**: Tendons transmit the force generated by muscles to the bones, facilitating movement. When a muscle contracts, the tendon pulls on the bone, resulting in joint movement.\n2. **Stability**: By anchoring muscles to bones, tendons help maintain the stability of joints during movement.\n3. **Energy Storage**: Some tendons, such as the Achilles tendon, can store elastic energy during activities like running or jumping, which enhances efficiency in movement.\n\n### Functions of Ligaments\nLigaments are strong bands of connective tissue that connect bones to other bones at joints. Their key functions include:\n\n1. **Joint Stability**: Ligaments provide stability to joints by limiting excessive movement and preventing dislocations. They help maintain proper alignment of bones during motion.\n2. **Range of Motion Control**: Ligaments restrict the range of motion of joints to prevent injuries. They ensure that bones glide smoothly over one another without colliding.\n3. **Shock Absorption**: Ligaments can absorb some of the forces exerted on joints, helping to protect the bones and cartilage from damage during physical activities.\n\nIn summary, tendons are crucial for enabling movement by connecting muscles to bones, while ligaments play a vital role in stabilizing joints and controlling their movement. Together, they ensure that the musculoskeletal system functions effectively, allowing for coordinated and safe physical activity.
