    How is anorexia nervosa diagnosed and what are its main symptoms?
answer: >-
    Anorexia nervosa is a serious eating disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading individuals to restrict their food intake significantly. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is based on specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). \n\n### Diagnostic Criteria\nAccording to the DSM-5, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa requires the following three criteria to be met:\n\n1. **Restriction of Energy Intake**: This involves a significant reduction in calorie consumption relative to the individual's requirements, resulting in a markedly low body weight for their age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.\n   \n2. **Intense Fear of Weight Gain**: Individuals with anorexia nervosa experience an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when they are underweight.\n\n3. **Distorted Body Image**: There is a persistent disturbance in the way oneâ€™s body weight or shape is experienced, which may include an undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation.\n\n### Main Symptoms\nThe symptoms of anorexia nervosa can be categorized into physical, behavioral, and psychological aspects:\n\n- **Physical Symptoms**:\n  - Significant weight loss or failure to gain weight during growth periods.\n  - Irregular heart rhythms and low blood pressure.\n  - Dehydration, which can lead to symptoms such as dry skin and changes in skin color (e.g., yellowing).\n  - Other physical signs may include cold intolerance, brittle hair and nails, and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation, though this criterion has been removed from the DSM-5).\n\n- **Behavioral Symptoms**:\n  - Avoidance of food and meals, often accompanied by excessive exercise.\n  - Preoccupation with food, dieting, and body size.\n  - Engaging in rituals around food, such as cutting food into small pieces or refusing to eat in front of others.\n\n- **Psychological Symptoms**:\n  - Distorted self-image, where individuals perceive themselves as overweight despite being underweight.\n  - Low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy.\n  - Anxiety and depression may also be present.\n\nDiagnosing anorexia nervosa can be challenging, as individuals may attempt to hide their symptoms. Early intervention and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and addressing the physical and psychological aspects of the disorder.
