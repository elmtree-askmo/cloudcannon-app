answer: >-
    The Four Worlds Institute Model defines well-being through a holistic lens that integrates the unique cultural, spiritual, and social needs of First Nations people. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals with their community and the natural world, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of health that goes beyond mere physical well-being.\n\n### Guiding Principles of the Four Worlds Institute Model\n\n1. **Holistic Health**: The model recognizes that health is not just the absence of disease but encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. This holistic approach aligns with Indigenous worldviews that see health as a balance between these aspects.\n\n2. **Cultural Identity**: The model emphasizes the importance of cultural identity and traditional knowledge systems in promoting well-being. It acknowledges that cultural practices and beliefs are integral to the health of First Nations communities.\n\n3. **Community Engagement**: The Four Worlds Institute promotes community-driven health initiatives, encouraging active participation from community members in the development and implementation of health programs. This principle fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment.\n\n4. **Determinants of Health**: The model identifies 14 determinants of health that reflect the specific needs of First Nations people. These determinants include basic physical needs, safety and security, community solidarity, and social support, which are often overlooked in conventional health models.\n\n5. **Interconnectedness**: The model is grounded in the belief that individuals are interconnected with their environment and community. This principle highlights the importance of stewardship of the land and living in harmony with nature as essential components of health.\n\n6. **Spiritual and Cultural Knowledge**: The integration of spiritual and cultural knowledge into health practices is a key aspect of the model. It recognizes that spiritual well-being is a vital component of overall health.\n\n7. **Social Justice and Equity**: The Four Worlds Institute advocates for social justice and equity in health care access and outcomes. It seeks to address health inequities that have arisen from historical policies and colonization impacts.\n\nBy incorporating these guiding principles, the Four Worlds Institute Model aims to create a more inclusive and effective framework for understanding and promoting the health and well-being of First Nations communities. This approach not only addresses the immediate health needs but also fosters long-term sustainability and resilience within these communities.
