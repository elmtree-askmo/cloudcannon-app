    How is the absorbed dose of radiation measured and what units are used?
answer: >-
    The absorbed dose of radiation is measured in grays (Gy). One gray is defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of tissue. This unit quantifies the amount of energy deposited in a material, which is crucial for assessing the potential biological effects of radiation exposure.\n\nIn addition to grays, the radiation absorbed dose can also be expressed in another unit called the rad, where 1 rad is equivalent to 0.01 joules per kilogram (J/kg). \n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the biological effects of radiation, the sievert (Sv) is used. The sievert accounts for the type of radiation and its impact on human health, providing a measure of the biological effect of the absorbed dose. The relationship between these units can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **1 Gy = 1 J/kg** (absorbed dose)\n- **1 rad = 0.01 Gy**\n- **1 Sv = RBE Ã— Gy** (where RBE is the relative biological effectiveness)\n\nIn summary, the primary units used for measuring absorbed radiation dose are the gray (Gy) and the rad, while the sievert (Sv) is used to express the biological effects of that radiation.
