    Identify the main components of the upper respiratory tract and their functions.
answer: >-
    The upper respiratory tract consists of several key components, each with specific functions that contribute to the overall process of respiration. The main components of the upper respiratory tract include:\n\n1. **Nose**: The external part of the nose serves as the primary entry point for air. It is equipped with nostrils (nares) that filter, warm, and humidify incoming air. The nose also contains olfactory receptors that are essential for the sense of smell.\n\n2. **Nasal Cavity**: This cavity is located behind the nose and is lined with respiratory mucosa, which traps particles and pathogens. The nasal cavity further conditions the air by warming and humidifying it before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. It also plays a role in olfaction.\n\n3. **Pharynx**: The pharynx is a muscular tube that connects the nasal cavity to the larynx and esophagus. It is divided into three sections: the nasopharynx (upper part), oropharynx (middle part), and laryngopharynx (lower part). The pharynx serves as a passageway for both air and food, and it plays a role in vocalization and the immune response by housing lymphoid tissue (tonsils).\n\nThese components work together to ensure that air is properly filtered, warmed, and humidified before it enters the lower respiratory tract, where gas exchange occurs. Additionally, the upper respiratory tract helps protect the body from environmental hazards and facilitates the sense of smell.
