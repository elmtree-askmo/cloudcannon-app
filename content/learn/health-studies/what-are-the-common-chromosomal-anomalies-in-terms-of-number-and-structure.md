    What are the common chromosomal anomalies in terms of number and structure?
answer: >-
    Chromosomal anomalies can be categorized into two main types: numerical and structural abnormalities.\n\n1. **Numerical Abnormalities**: These involve changes in the number of chromosomes. The most common type of numerical abnormality is **aneuploidy**, which refers to the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes due to an extra or missing chromosome. Most aneuploid patients exhibit **trisomy**, where there are three copies of a particular chromosome, rather than **monosomy**, which is characterized by a single copy. For example:\n   - **Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)**: This is the most well-known example of aneuploidy, where individuals have three copies of chromosome 21.\n   - **Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18)** and **Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13)** are other examples of trisomy conditions.\n\n2. **Structural Abnormalities**: These involve alterations in the structure of chromosomes. Structural abnormalities can occur when parts of a chromosome are missing, extra, switched to another chromosome, or inverted. These abnormalities can arise from breakage and incorrect rejoining of chromosomal segments. Structural rearrangements are classified as:\n   - **Balanced**: The complete chromosomal set is present, though rearranged.\n   - **Unbalanced**: There is additional or missing genetic information, which can lead to various diseases.\n\nCommon structural chromosomal abnormalities include:\n- **Cri-du-chat Syndrome**: Caused by a deletion of a portion of chromosome 5 (5p minus).\n- **Prader-Willi Syndrome**: Often results from a deletion in the 15q11-q12 region.\n\nOverall, chromosomal abnormalities can significantly impact health and development, with approximately 0.4 to 0.9% of newborns being affected by such anomalies, and about half of these cases presenting with an abnormal phenotype.
