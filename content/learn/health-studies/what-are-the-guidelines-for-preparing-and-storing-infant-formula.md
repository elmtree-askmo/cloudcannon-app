    When preparing and storing infant formula, it is crucial to follow specific guidelines to ensure the safety and nutrition of the formula for your baby. Here are the key recommendations:\n\n### Preparation Guidelines\n1. **Check Expiration Dates**: Always check the expiration date on the formula packaging before use.\n2. **Use Clean Equipment**: Ensure that all bottles, nipples, and utensils are clean and sterilized before preparing the formula.\n3. **Follow Instructions**: Prepare the formula according to the manufacturer's instructions, measuring the powder and water accurately.\n\n### Storage Guidelines\n1. **Use Quickly or Store Safely**:\n   - Prepared infant formula should be used within **2 hours** of preparation.\n   - If feeding has not started within **1 hour** of preparation, the formula should be stored in the refrigerator and used within **24 hours**.\n   - Any formula left in the bottle after feeding should be discarded and not stored for later use, as bacteria from the baby's saliva can grow in the leftover formula.\n\n2. **Refrigeration**: \n   - Store prepared formula in the refrigerator at a temperature of **4°C (39°F)** or cooler. Use a fridge thermometer to ensure the correct temperature.\n   - Never freeze infant formula, as freezing can alter its nutrient composition.\n\n3. **Handling Leftovers**: \n   - Discard any unused formula that has been left out at room temperature for more than **2 hours**.\n   - Do not attempt to reheat or reuse formula that has been previously fed to the baby.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- For powdered infant formula (PIF), specific guidelines may vary depending on whether it is being prepared in a healthcare setting or at home. Parents should refer to resources from health authorities for detailed instructions tailored to their situation.\n- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against making homemade infant formula, as it may not meet the nutritional needs of infants.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, parents can help ensure that their baby's formula is safe and nutritious. For more detailed information, resources from organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics can be beneficial.
