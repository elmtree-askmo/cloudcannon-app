    What roles do Midwifery Associate Professionals play in the classification?
answer: >-
    Midwifery Associate Professionals play a significant role in the classification of health workers, particularly within the framework of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08). According to the ISCO-08, Midwifery Associate Professionals are classified under the health associate professionals category, specifically identified as code 3222. \n\nTheir primary responsibilities include providing basic health care and advice to women before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth. They implement care, treatment, and referral plans that are typically established by medical, midwifery, and other health professionals. This classification emphasizes the importance of their role in maternal and newborn health, as they are integral to the healthcare team, working alongside midwives and other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care.\n\nThe ISCO-08 framework categorizes health workers into five broad groupings, which include health professionals, health associate professionals, and personal care workers. Midwifery Associate Professionals fall under the health associate professionals grouping, which highlights their supportive yet essential role in the healthcare system. This classification not only aids in understanding the scope of practice for these professionals but also enhances the comparability of health worker data across different countries and over time.\n\nIn summary, Midwifery Associate Professionals are classified as health associate professionals within the ISCO-08 framework, reflecting their critical contributions to maternal and child health care and the broader health workforce.
