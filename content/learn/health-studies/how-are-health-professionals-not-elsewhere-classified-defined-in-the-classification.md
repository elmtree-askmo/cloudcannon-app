    How are Health Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified defined in the classification?
answer: >-
    Health Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified is a specific unit group within the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) framework, particularly under Sub-major Group 22, which encompasses health professionals. This classification is designed to include health professionals whose occupations do not fit into other defined categories within this group.\n\nThe definition of Health Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified includes a variety of occupations that provide diagnostic, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services. Examples of such professionals include podiatrists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, chiropractors, and osteopaths. These roles are essential in the healthcare system, as they contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals through specialized care and treatment.\n\nThe ISCO classification system, which is maintained by the International Labour Organization (ILO), aims to facilitate the organization and comparison of occupational data across different countries and over time. By categorizing health professionals in this manner, it enhances the ability to analyze workforce data, improve health worker data management, and support global health workforce planning and policy-making.
