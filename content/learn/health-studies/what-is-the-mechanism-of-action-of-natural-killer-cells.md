    What is the mechanism of action of natural killer cells?
answer: >-
    Natural killer (NK) cells are a vital component of the innate immune system, known for their ability to recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their mechanism of action involves several key processes:\n\n1. **Cytotoxic Activity**: NK cells exhibit spontaneous cytolytic activity, meaning they can kill target cells directly. Upon encountering stressed cells, such as those infected by viruses or transformed into cancer cells, NK cells form immune synapses with these targets. This interaction allows them to deliver cytotoxic molecules, primarily perforins and granzymes. Perforins create pores in the target cell membrane, while granzymes enter through these pores to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the target cell.\n\n2. **Receptor Balance**: The activation of NK cells is regulated by a balance between activating and inhibitory receptors. Activating receptors, such as natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and the low-affinity Fc receptor CD16, promote NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. In contrast, inhibitory receptors, including killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), prevent NK cells from attacking healthy cells by recognizing self-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. This balance ensures that NK cells target only abnormal or infected cells while sparing healthy tissues.\n\n3. **Cytokine Secretion**: Activated NK cells also play a crucial role in modulating the immune response by secreting various cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These cytokines enhance the immune response by activating other immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and promoting inflammation.\n\n4. **Adaptive Features**: Recent studies have shown that NK cells can exhibit adaptive features, such as increased longevity and the ability to expand their subsets in response to specific challenges. This adaptability allows them to respond more effectively to recurrent infections or malignancies.\n\nIn summary, the mechanism of action of natural killer cells involves direct cytotoxicity through the release of perforins and granzymes, a finely tuned balance of activating and inhibitory receptors, and the secretion of cytokines that orchestrate broader immune responses. Their ability to act quickly and effectively makes them a crucial first line of defense against infections and tumors.
