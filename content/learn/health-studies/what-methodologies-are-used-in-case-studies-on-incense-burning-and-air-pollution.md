    What methodologies are used in case studies on incense burning and air pollution?
answer: >-
    In case studies on incense burning and air pollution, various methodologies are employed to assess the impact of incense smoke on indoor air quality and health. Here are some key methodologies based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Field Investigations**: Researchers often conduct field studies in environments where incense is commonly burned, such as pagodas or homes. For example, a study in Vietnam investigated visitor behavior and the air pollution situation related to incense burning. This approach typically involves surveys to understand user habits (e.g., the number of sticks burned) and the associated health effects reported by individuals, such as eye irritation or difficulty breathing.\n\n2. **Air Quality Monitoring**: Many studies utilize air quality monitors to measure particulate matter (PM) concentrations and size distributions in indoor spaces during incense burning. For instance, one study reported monitoring particle emissions and concentration changes for particles ranging from 10 nm to 10 Âµm, revealing significant increases in PM levels during incense burning events.\n\n3. **Laboratory Experiments**: Some research is conducted in controlled laboratory settings to quantify the pollutant reduction effects of burning incense. For example, a study examined the impact of adding calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to incense burning and its effects on reducing particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n\n4. **Correlational Cohort Studies**: These studies investigate the association between the duration of incense exposure and health outcomes, such as lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This methodology often involves recruiting participants and assessing their exposure levels alongside health metrics.\n\n5. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Analysis**: Researchers analyze the emissions of VOCs, particularly benzene, from burning incense in indoor environments. This can involve using experimental clean rooms to measure VOC concentrations and their potential health impacts.\n\n6. **Population-Based Case-Referent Studies**: Some studies focus on specific health outcomes, such as lung cancer risk associated with incense smoke exposure. These studies typically recruit participants and compare those exposed to incense smoke with a control group to identify potential health risks.\n\nThese methodologies collectively contribute to a better understanding of the health implications of incense burning and the mechanisms by which it affects indoor air quality. The findings from such studies are crucial for developing strategies to mitigate air pollution and protect public health.
