    Who are the typical participants in community-based diabetes prevention studies?
answer: >-
    In community-based diabetes prevention studies, the typical participants are often individuals who are at heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those with prediabetes. These studies frequently target populations that are disproportionately affected by diabetes, including economically disadvantaged groups and specific ethnic communities. \n\nFor instance, the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), which has been implemented across various community settings, primarily serves individuals with prediabetes or those identified as at risk for T2D. Participants in these programs usually engage in lifestyle interventions aimed at achieving a minimum of 5% weight loss over the course of a year, which has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes.\n\nResearch indicates that community-based interventions often involve group settings where participants can share experiences and support each other. For example, studies have included participants from clinics and community-based organizations, with some programs specifically designed for populations such as Latinas or economically disadvantaged adults. \n\nOverall, the focus is on engaging individuals who are at risk, providing them with education and resources to make lifestyle changes that can prevent the onset of diabetes.
