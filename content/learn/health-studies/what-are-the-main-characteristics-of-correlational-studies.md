    What are the main characteristics of correlational studies?
answer: >-
    Correlational studies, also known as ecological studies in the context of epidemiology, are a type of non-experimental research that focuses on examining the relationships between two or more variables without manipulating them. Here are the main characteristics of correlational studies:\n\n1. **Observational Nature**: Correlational studies are inherently observational. Researchers do not manipulate the variables; instead, they observe and measure them as they naturally occur. This allows for the assessment of relationships between variables in real-world settings.\n\n2. **Population-Level Data**: These studies often utilize data collected at the group or population level rather than individual-level data. This means that the analysis is based on averages or aggregates, which can sometimes obscure individual variations.\n\n3. **Statistical Relationships**: The primary goal of correlational studies is to identify and quantify the statistical relationship between variables. This is often expressed through a correlation coefficient, which ranges from +1 (perfect positive correlation) to -1 (perfect negative correlation). A correlation indicates that as one variable changes, the other variable tends to change in a predictable manner.\n\n4. **No Causal Inference**: While correlational studies can identify associations between variables, they do not establish causation. This limitation arises because the lack of manipulation means that other confounding factors may influence the observed relationships.\n\n5. **Use of Existing Data**: Correlational studies often rely on existing data sources, which can make them less invasive and more cost-effective. However, this reliance can also introduce issues related to data accuracy and classification.\n\n6. **Exploratory Research**: These studies are particularly useful in exploratory research contexts, where the goal is to identify potential relationships between variables before conducting more controlled experimental studies.\n\n7. **Ethical Considerations**: Correlational studies are often employed when it is impractical or unethical to manipulate variables. For example, studying the effects of smoking on health outcomes would be unethical to conduct as an experiment.\n\n8. **Limitations**: Correlational studies can be affected by extraneous factors that researchers cannot control, leading to potential biases. Additionally, the ecological fallacy is a risk, where conclusions drawn about individuals based on group data may not hold true.\n\nIn summary, correlational studies are valuable tools in epidemiology and other fields for identifying relationships between variables, but they come with limitations regarding causation and potential confounding factors.
