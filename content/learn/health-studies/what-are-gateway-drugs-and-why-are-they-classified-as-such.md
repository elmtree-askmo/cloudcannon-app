    What are gateway drugs and why are they classified as such?
answer: >-
    Gateway drugs are substances that are often considered to be introductory or milder forms of drug use, which can lead individuals to experiment with more harmful and addictive drugs. Common examples of gateway drugs include alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. These substances are typically legal, easily accessible, and socially accepted, making them more likely to be used, especially by adolescents.\n\nThe classification of these substances as gateway drugs is based on the theory that their use can lower inhibitions and increase the likelihood of trying other, more dangerous drugs. This concept is sometimes referred to as the escalation hypothesis or the stepping-stone theory. Research indicates that individuals who use gateway drugs may become more accustomed to altering their state of mind, which can make them more open to experimenting with harder substances.\n\nFor instance, studies have shown that individuals who begin using alcohol or marijuana at a young age are significantly more likely to develop substance use disorders later in life. Specifically, teens who use alcohol before the age of 15 are six times more likely to become alcohol dependent compared to those who start drinking at age 21. Similarly, those who use marijuana by age 17 are two to five times more likely to experience substance abuse issues later on.\n\nThe neurobiological aspect of gateway drugs also plays a role; these substances can impact the brain's reward system, making individuals more susceptible to seeking out other drugs to achieve similar or heightened effects. This progression from gateway drugs to more serious substance abuse is a significant concern in public health discussions regarding drug use and prevention strategies.\n\nIn summary, gateway drugs are classified as such due to their potential to lead to the use of more harmful substances, particularly among young users, and the social and legal factors that contribute to their accessibility.
