    What efforts are being made globally to eradicate Hepatitis B?
answer: >-
    Global efforts to eradicate Hepatitis B are primarily guided by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis, which was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2016. This strategy aims to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, with specific targets including a 90% reduction in new chronic hepatitis B infections and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015 levels.\n\nKey components of the global eradication efforts include:\n\n1. **Vaccination**: The WHO emphasizes the importance of hepatitis B vaccination as a primary prevention strategy. Ensuring that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth is crucial for reducing the incidence of the virus.\n\n2. **Improved Testing and Treatment**: The WHO has set goals to increase the number of people diagnosed and treated for hepatitis B. As of 2019, approximately 30.4 million people living with hepatitis B were aware of their infection status, and 6.6 million were receiving treatment, showing progress from previous years.\n\n3. **Guidance and Support**: The WHO has released the first-ever global guidance for countries seeking to validate the elimination of hepatitis B and C as public health problems. This guidance encourages all countries to work towards the common goal of viral hepatitis elimination by 2030, regardless of their current burden of hepatitis-related diseases.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: The strategy includes monitoring progress towards the elimination goals, with specific targets for reducing new infections and mortality rates. The WHO aims for a 30% reduction in new infections by 2020 and a 90% reduction by 2030.\n\n5. **Addressing Barriers**: The WHO and various stakeholders are working to overcome barriers to access for hepatitis B testing and treatment, ensuring that guidelines reflect the needs and preferences of affected populations.\n\n6. **Global Collaboration**: Efforts are being made to coordinate actions among countries, health systems, and non-governmental organizations to enhance the effectiveness of hepatitis elimination projects.\n\nIn summary, the global eradication efforts for Hepatitis B are multifaceted, focusing on vaccination, improved access to testing and treatment, and international collaboration, all aimed at achieving the ambitious targets set for 2030.
