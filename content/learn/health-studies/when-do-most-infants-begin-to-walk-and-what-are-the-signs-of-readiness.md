    When do most infants begin to walk, and what are the signs of readiness?
answer: >-
    Most infants begin to walk between 12 and 18 months of age, although some may start as early as 9 months or as late as 18 months, and both ends of this spectrum are considered normal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies walking as a developmental milestone expected by 18 months, with the ability to take a few steps noted as a milestone by 15 months.\n\nSigns of readiness for walking typically include:\n\n1. **Pulling Up to Stand**: Infants often start pulling themselves up to a standing position while holding onto furniture, which indicates they are preparing to walk.\n2. **Cruising**: This involves sidestepping along furniture for support, showing that they are gaining confidence in their ability to balance.\n3. **Balancing**: Babies may begin to balance on their legs when held in a standing position, which is another sign they are getting ready to take their first steps.\n\nOther indicators that a baby is close to walking include the ability to stand when supported by someone and showing interest in moving around independently. If a child is unable to stand when supported by 12 months, cannot take steps on their own by 15 months, or does not walk steadily by 2 years, it is advisable to consult a pediatrician for further evaluation.
