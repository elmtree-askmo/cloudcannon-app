    What are the symptoms and causes of subacute thyroiditis?
answer: >-
    Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an uncommon inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland, often triggered by a viral infection. Here are the key symptoms and causes associated with subacute thyroiditis:\n\n### Symptoms\n1. **Neck Pain**: The most prominent symptom is pain in the neck, which may radiate to the jaw or ears. This pain is due to the swelling and inflammation of the thyroid gland.\n2. **Thyroid Tenderness**: The thyroid gland may be tender to touch, and gentle pressure can elicit discomfort.\n3. **Fever**: Patients often experience fever as part of the systemic inflammatory response.\n4. **Muscle Pain**: Generalized muscle pain may also occur.\n5. **Hyperthyroidism**: Initially, subacute thyroiditis can lead to hyperthyroidism, characterized by symptoms such as weight loss, increased heart rate, and anxiety.\n6. **Transient Hypothyroidism**: Following the hyperthyroid phase, some patients may experience a temporary period of hypothyroidism, which can include symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.\n\n### Causes\nSubacute thyroiditis is primarily thought to be caused by viral infections, often occurring after an upper respiratory tract infection. Specific viruses that have been implicated include:\n- **Mumps Virus**\n- **Influenza Virus**\n- Other respiratory viruses\n\nThe condition typically arises a few weeks after the initial viral infection, leading to inflammation of the thyroid gland. The inflammation results in the release of excessive thyroid hormones, which can cause the initial hyperthyroid symptoms, followed by a phase of hypothyroidism before returning to normal thyroid function.\n\n### Summary\nSubacute thyroiditis is characterized by a triphasic clinical course involving hyperthyroidism, transient hypothyroidism, and eventual normalization of thyroid function. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by thyroid function tests, and treatment often involves high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage pain and inflammation.
