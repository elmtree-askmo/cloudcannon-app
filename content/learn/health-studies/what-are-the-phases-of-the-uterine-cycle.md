    The uterine cycle consists of three phases: the menstrual phase where the endometrial lining sheds, the proliferative phase where the endometrium thickens, and the secretory phase where the lining prepares for implantation.

    What are the phases of the uterine cycle?
answer: >-
    The uterine cycle, which is part of the menstrual cycle, consists of three distinct phases:\n\n1. **Menstrual Phase**: This phase marks the beginning of the uterine cycle and is characterized by the shedding of the endometrial lining, resulting in menstrual bleeding. It typically starts on the first day of the menstrual cycle when progesterone levels drop, leading to the breakdown of the uterine lining.\n\n2. **Proliferative Phase**: Following menstruation, the proliferative phase occurs, during which the endometrium begins to thicken and regenerate in response to rising estrogen levels. This phase prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg.\n\n3. **Secretory Phase**: This phase begins after ovulation and is driven by progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum. During the secretory phase, the endometrial glands secrete glycogen-rich fluid, further preparing the uterine lining for implantation. If fertilization does not occur, progesterone levels will eventually decline, leading back to the menstrual phase.\n\nThese phases are regulated by hormonal changes that occur in conjunction with the ovarian cycle, which includes the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. Understanding these phases is crucial for comprehending the overall reproductive cycle and its implications for fertility and menstrual health.
