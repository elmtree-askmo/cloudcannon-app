    What are indigenous conceptions of health?
answer: >-
    Indigenous conceptions of health are characterized by a holistic understanding that encompasses multiple dimensions of well-being, including spiritual, environmental, cultural, social, physical, and mental health. This perspective is rooted in the belief that health is not merely the absence of disease but a state of overall well-being that is interconnected with the community and the natural environment.\n\nFor instance, the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (NAHS) defines health as "not just the physical well-being of the individual but the social, emotional, and cultural well-being of the whole community." This definition emphasizes the importance of collective health and the role of community in individual well-being. Indigenous Peoples view health as both an individual and a collective right, with strong ties to their land and cultural practices.\n\nThe World Health Organization's 1999 Declaration on the Health and Survival of Indigenous Peoples further supports this holistic view, stating that Indigenous health encompasses a continuum that integrates individual and collective aspects across generations. This perspective highlights the significance of cultural connection, sense of belonging, and intergenerational knowledge in promoting health.\n\nHowever, Indigenous conceptions of health often face challenges within non-Indigenous health systems, which may overlook or disregard these holistic approaches. The lack of recognition of Indigenous cultural assets and the imposition of colonial legacies can create barriers to accessing appropriate health care.\n\nIn summary, Indigenous conceptions of health are deeply rooted in a holistic framework that integrates various dimensions of well-being, emphasizing the importance of community, culture, and the environment in achieving health. This understanding calls for an intercultural approach to health care that respects and incorporates Indigenous perspectives and practices.
