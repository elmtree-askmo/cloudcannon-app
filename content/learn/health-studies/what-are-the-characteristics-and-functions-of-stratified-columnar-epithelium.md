    What are the characteristics and functions of stratified columnar epithelium?
answer: >-
    Stratified columnar epithelium is a type of stratified epithelium characterized by multiple layers of cells, with the apical layer consisting of columnar cells. The deeper layers can be composed of either cuboidal or columnar cells, which may vary in shape and size. This epithelial type is relatively rare compared to other forms of epithelial tissue.\n\n### Characteristics:\n1. **Layering**: Stratified columnar epithelium consists of several layers of cells, providing a robust structure.\n2. **Cell Shape**: The topmost layer is made up of columnar cells, while the underlying layers may include cuboidal or columnar cells.\n3. **Location**: It is primarily found in specific areas of the human body, including:\n   - Conjunctiva of the eye\n   - Male urethra\n   - Anus\n   - Pharynx\n   - Lobar ducts of certain glands (e.g., salivary glands)\n\n### Functions:\n1. **Protection**: The primary function of stratified columnar epithelium is to protect underlying tissues from physical and microbial damage. The multiple layers of cells act as a barrier against various stresses.\n2. **Secretion**: Depending on its location, stratified columnar epithelium may also have a limited role in secretion, contributing to the production of mucus and other substances.\n\nIn summary, stratified columnar epithelium serves crucial protective and secretory functions in specific regions of the body, making it an important component of the epithelial tissue family.
