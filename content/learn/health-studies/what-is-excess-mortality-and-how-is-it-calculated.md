    What is excess mortality and how is it calculated?
answer: >-
    Excess mortality is a critical measure in epidemiology and public health that quantifies the number of deaths from all causes during a specific period that exceed what would be expected under normal conditions. This metric is particularly useful for assessing the impact of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as it captures not only confirmed deaths from the disease but also those indirectly related to the pandemic, such as deaths from other health conditions due to overwhelmed healthcare systems.\n\n### Calculation of Excess Mortality\n\nExcess mortality is calculated by comparing the observed number of deaths during a specific time frame to the expected number of deaths for that same period. The expected number of deaths can be estimated using various models, with one commonly referenced model being the one developed by Karlinsky and Kobak. This model accounts for year-to-year trends in mortality, which helps to provide a more accurate baseline than simply using the average number of deaths over previous years (e.g., 2015-2019).\n\nThe calculation can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Observed Mortality**: This is the total number of deaths recorded during the specified period.\n2. **Expected Mortality**: This is the number of deaths that would have been expected in the absence of the crisis, estimated using statistical models that consider historical data and trends.\n3. **Excess Mortality**: The difference between observed and expected mortality is calculated as:\n   $$\n   \text{Excess Mortality} = \text{Observed Mortality} - \text{Expected Mortality}\n   $$\n\n### Methodological Considerations\n\n- **Data Sources**: There is no single source for excess mortality data; it often requires compiling information from various health organizations and statistical agencies.\n- **Indirect Deaths**: Excess mortality includes deaths that may not be directly attributed to COVID-19 but are related to the pandemic's broader impacts, such as disruptions in healthcare access.\n- **Statistical Models**: Different statistical methods can be employed to estimate expected mortality, including linear extrapolation of past death figures or more complex forecasting models.\n\n### Importance of Excess Mortality\n\nExcess mortality provides a more comprehensive view of the health burden during a crisis than confirmed death counts alone. It helps to highlight the broader impacts of events like the COVID-19 pandemic, including the strain on healthcare systems and the indirect consequences on public health.\n\nIn summary, excess mortality serves as a vital tool for understanding the full impact of health crises and guiding public health strategies.
