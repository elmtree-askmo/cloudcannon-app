    Name the major organ systems in the human body and describe their primary functions.
answer: >-
    The human body consists of 11 major organ systems, each with specific functions that are essential for maintaining homeostasis and overall health. Here is a detailed overview of these organ systems and their primary functions:\n\n1. **Integumentary System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Protects the body from external damage, regulates temperature, and provides sensory information.\n   - **Major Organs**: Skin, hair, nails, and associated glands.\n\n2. **Skeletal System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Provides structure and support, protects internal organs, facilitates movement, and stores minerals.\n   - **Major Organs**: Bones, cartilage, ligaments, and joints.\n\n3. **Muscular System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Enables movement of the body and maintains posture; also generates heat.\n   - **Major Organs**: Skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscle.\n\n4. **Nervous System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Controls and coordinates body activities by transmitting signals between different parts of the body.\n   - **Major Organs**: Brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.\n\n5. **Endocrine System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Regulates bodily functions through hormones, influencing growth, metabolism, and mood.\n   - **Major Organs**: Glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas.\n\n6. **Cardiovascular System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Transports blood, nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body.\n   - **Major Organs**: Heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries).\n\n7. **Lymphatic System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Supports immune function and returns excess tissue fluid to the bloodstream.\n   - **Major Organs**: Lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, spleen, and thymus.\n\n8. **Respiratory System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Facilitates gas exchange, allowing oxygen to enter the body and carbon dioxide to be expelled.\n   - **Major Organs**: Lungs, trachea, bronchi, and diaphragm.\n\n9. **Digestive System**: \n   - **Primary Function**: Breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and eliminates waste.\n   - **Major Organs**: Mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.\n\n10. **Urinary System**: \n    - **Primary Function**: Eliminates waste products from the body and regulates water and electrolyte balance.\n    - **Major Organs**: Kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.\n\n11. **Reproductive System**: \n    - **Primary Function**: Produces gametes (sperm and eggs) and hormones; facilitates reproduction.\n    - **Major Organs**: In males: testes, prostate, and penis; in females: ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.\n\nUnderstanding these organ systems is crucial for studying human physiology and medicine, as they work together to maintain the body's overall function and health.
