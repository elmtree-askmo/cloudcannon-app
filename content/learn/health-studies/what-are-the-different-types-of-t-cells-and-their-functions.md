    What are the different types of T cells and their functions?
answer: >-
    T cells, or T lymphocytes, are a vital component of the adaptive immune system, playing diverse roles in defending the body against infections and diseases. The main types of T cells include:\n\n1. **Helper T Cells (CD4+ T Cells)**: These cells are crucial for orchestrating the immune response. They assist other immune cells by releasing cytokines, which stimulate the maturation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells, activate cytotoxic T cells, and enhance the activity of macrophages. Helper T cells can further differentiate into various subtypes, including:\n   - **Th1 Cells**: Primarily involved in the response against intracellular pathogens and activating macrophages.\n   - **Th2 Cells**: Play a role in combating extracellular parasites and are involved in allergic responses.\n   - **Th17 Cells**: Important for defense against fungal infections and in autoimmune diseases.\n   - **Follicular Helper T Cells (Tfh)**: Assist in the activation of B cells and the formation of germinal centers in lymph nodes.\n\n2. **Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+ T Cells)**: These cells are primarily responsible for killing infected or cancerous cells. They recognize and destroy cells that present specific antigens, particularly those infected with viruses or harboring intracellular bacteria. Cytotoxic T cells release perforins and granzymes, which induce apoptosis in target cells.\n\n3. **Regulatory T Cells (Tregs)**: These cells play a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses. They help modulate the immune response by suppressing the activation and proliferation of other immune cells.\n\n4. **Memory T Cells**: After an infection has been cleared, some T cells differentiate into memory T cells, which persist long-term in the body. These cells enable a faster and more effective response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.\n\nEach type of T cell has distinct functions and contributes to the overall immune response, ensuring that the body can effectively combat a wide range of pathogens while maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. The balance and interaction between these T cell subsets are essential for a healthy immune system.
