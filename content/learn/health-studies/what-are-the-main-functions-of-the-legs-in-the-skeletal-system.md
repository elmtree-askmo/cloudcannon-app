    What are the main functions of the legs in the skeletal system?
answer: >-
    The legs play several crucial functions in the skeletal system, primarily related to support, mobility, and stability. Here are the main functions of the legs:\n\n1. **Support and Stability**: The legs provide a strong foundation for the body, supporting its weight and maintaining balance. The femur, tibia, and fibula work together to bear the load of the upper body, allowing for upright posture.\n\n2. **Mobility**: The legs enable movement through various activities such as walking, running, and jumping. The joints in the legs, including the hip, knee, and ankle joints, allow for a wide range of motion, facilitating locomotion.\n\n3. **Shock Absorption**: The bones of the legs are designed to absorb impact forces during activities like walking or running. For instance, the tibia and fibula can withstand forces that are 2-3 times the body's weight, which is essential for preventing injuries during physical activities.\n\n4. **Articulation**: The legs articulate with the pelvis and the foot, allowing for complex movements. The pelvic girdle connects the legs to the axial skeleton, while the joints in the legs enable various movements necessary for daily activities.\n\n5. **Muscle Attachment**: The legs serve as attachment points for numerous muscles, tendons, and ligaments. These muscles work in conjunction with the skeletal structure to produce movement and maintain stability.\n\nOverall, the legs are integral to the skeletal system, contributing to the body's overall functionality and mobility.
