    To reduce ambient noise during hearing tests using Hearing Screening Smartphone Applications (HSSAs), several strategies can be employed based on the gathered information:\n\n1. **Quiet Environment Recommendation**: It is essential to instruct users to perform the hearing test in a quiet environment. This recommendation is supported by ANSI standards, which specify that audiometric test rooms should have ambient noise levels that produce negligible masking (less than or equal to 2 dB) of a pure tone. However, what constitutes a "quiet" environment can be subjective and may vary from person to person.\n\n2. **Active Ambient Noise Monitoring**: Incorporating active ambient noise level monitoring via the smartphoneâ€™s microphone can help ensure that the testing environment is sufficiently quiet. This feature allows the application to measure ambient noise levels and provide feedback to the user, prompting them to move to a quieter location if necessary.\n\n3. **User Instructions**: Applications can provide clear instructions to users about the importance of minimizing background noise. This can include advising users to turn off any devices that may produce noise, such as fans or computers, and to choose a location that is inherently quieter, like a bedroom.\n\n4. **Ambient Noise Reduction Features**: According to Irace et al. (2021), 64% of HSSAs include some form of ambient noise reduction strategy. These strategies can either measure ambient noise levels or simply instruct users to find a quieter environment. Implementing such features can significantly enhance the accuracy of the hearing tests.\n\n5. **Testing in Controlled Environments**: Whenever possible, conducting tests in controlled environments, such as sound booths that meet ANSI standards, can provide the most accurate results. Studies have shown that tests performed in sound booths yield more reliable audiometric thresholds compared to those conducted in less controlled settings.\n\n6. **User Education on Impact of Noise**: Educating users about how ambient noise can affect test results is crucial. Users should understand that noise can mask the test signals, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments of their hearing ability.\n\nBy employing these strategies, HSSAs can improve the accuracy of hearing tests and ensure that users receive reliable assessments of their hearing health.
