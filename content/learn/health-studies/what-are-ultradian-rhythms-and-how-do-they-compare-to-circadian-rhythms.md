    What are ultradian rhythms and how do they compare to circadian rhythms?
answer: >-
    Ultradian rhythms are biological rhythms that have a cycle duration of less than 24 hours. They can range from minutes to several hours and are characterized by repeated patterns of physiological or behavioral changes. Common examples of ultradian rhythms include the cycles of sleep stages during a nightâ€™s sleep, the fluctuations in hormone levels throughout the day, and the intervals of hunger and satiety.\n\nIn contrast, circadian rhythms are biological rhythms that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle. These rhythms are primarily regulated by an internal biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain. Circadian rhythms influence various physiological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle, hormone release (such as melatonin), and metabolism. They are synchronized with environmental cues, known as zeitgebers, such as light and temperature.\n\nTo summarize the key differences:\n\n- **Duration**: \n  - Ultradian rhythms: Less than 24 hours (e.g., sleep cycles, hormonal fluctuations).\n  - Circadian rhythms: Approximately 24 hours (e.g., sleep-wake cycle, daily hormone release).\n\n- **Regulation**: \n  - Ultradian rhythms: Can be influenced by various internal and external factors but do not rely on a central clock like circadian rhythms.\n  - Circadian rhythms: Primarily regulated by the SCN and synchronized with environmental cues.\n\nUnderstanding these rhythms is crucial for recognizing how they impact overall health and behavior, as well as their implications in various fields such as chronobiology and sleep medicine.
