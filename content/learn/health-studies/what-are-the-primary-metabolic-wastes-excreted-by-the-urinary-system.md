    What are the primary metabolic wastes excreted by the urinary system?
answer: >-
    The primary metabolic wastes excreted by the urinary system include:\n\n1. **Urea**: This is a product of protein catabolism. Urea is formed in the liver from ammonia, which is a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism. The kidneys filter urea from the blood and excrete it in urine.\n\n2. **Uric Acid**: This waste product results from the breakdown of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Uric acid is produced in the liver and is also filtered out by the kidneys, where it is excreted in urine.\n\n3. **Creatinine**: This is a waste product generated from muscle metabolism, specifically from the breakdown of creatine phosphate, which is involved in energy production in muscles. Like urea and uric acid, creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine.\n\nThese metabolic wastes are crucial for the body's homeostasis, as their accumulation can lead to toxicity. The kidneys play a vital role in filtering these substances from the bloodstream and maintaining the body's overall balance of fluids and electrolytes.
