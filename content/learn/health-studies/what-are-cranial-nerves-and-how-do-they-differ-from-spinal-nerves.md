    What are cranial nerves and how do they differ from spinal nerves?
answer: >-
    Cranial nerves and spinal nerves are both essential components of the peripheral nervous system, but they differ significantly in their origin, structure, and function.\n\n### Cranial Nerves\nCranial nerves originate directly from the brain, specifically from the brainstem, and there are a total of 12 pairs of cranial nerves in humans. Each cranial nerve is numbered (I to XII) and named based on its function or the area it innervates. These nerves primarily serve the head and neck regions, and they are involved in various functions, including:\n\n- **Sensory Functions**: Some cranial nerves are responsible for special senses such as vision (optic nerve II), hearing (vestibulocochlear nerve VIII), taste (facial nerve VII), and smell (olfactory nerve I).\n- **Motor Functions**: Other cranial nerves control the movement of muscles in the head and neck, such as the oculomotor nerve (III), which controls eye movements.\n\n### Spinal Nerves\nIn contrast, spinal nerves arise from the spinal cord and are grouped into 31 pairs, which include cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and one coccygeal pair. Each spinal nerve is attached to the spinal cord by two roots: the dorsal sensory root and the ventral motor root. Spinal nerves serve a broader area of the body, innervating the trunk and limbs. Their functions include:\n\n- **Mixed Functions**: Each spinal nerve contains both sensory and motor fibers, allowing them to transmit sensory information (such as touch, pain, and temperature) from the body to the central nervous system (CNS) and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.\n- **Reflex Actions**: Spinal nerves are also involved in reflex actions, which are involuntary responses to stimuli.\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Origin**: Cranial nerves arise from the brain, while spinal nerves arise from the spinal cord.\n2. **Number**: There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves.\n3. **Function**: Cranial nerves primarily serve the head and neck, often related to special senses and motor functions, whereas spinal nerves innervate the rest of the body, providing both sensory and motor functions.\n\nIn summary, cranial nerves are specialized for functions related to the head and neck, while spinal nerves have a more extensive role in connecting the CNS to the rest of the body.
