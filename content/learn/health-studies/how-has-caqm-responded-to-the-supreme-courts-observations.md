    How has CAQM responded to the Supreme Court's observations?
answer: >-
    The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has responded to the Supreme Court's observations by issuing new guidelines and reconsidering its previous decisions regarding pollution management in the National Capital Region (NCR). Following the Supreme Court's directives, the CAQM has taken several actions:\n\n1. **New Guidelines on Construction Activities**: In light of the Supreme Court's recent directives, the CAQM has issued new guidelines under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage construction activities. These guidelines aim to curb pollution during peak smog seasons while allowing essential projects to continue.\n\n2. **Reevaluation of School Closures**: The Supreme Court directed the CAQM to reconsider its decision to close schools, particularly for classes 10 to 12, emphasizing the importance of mid-day meals for students and the limitations of online education. The CAQM has been tasked with evaluating the possibility of reopening physical classes in schools and educational institutions affected by the pollution crisis.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Accountability**: The Supreme Court has mandated that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state pollution control bodies must tag the CAQM in their responses to complaints on social media. This measure is intended to enhance the CAQM's ability to monitor the effectiveness of pollution control measures and ensure accountability.\n\n4. **Continuation of Emergency Measures**: The Supreme Court has decided that emergency measures under Stage IV of the GRAP will continue in Delhi until there is a consistent downward trend in air quality index (AQI) levels. The CAQM is responsible for determining when it is appropriate to relax these measures.\n\nOverall, the CAQM's response reflects an effort to balance public health concerns, particularly regarding education and student welfare, with the need to address air pollution effectively.
