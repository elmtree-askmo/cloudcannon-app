    How has Odisha integrated into the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme?
answer: >-
    Odisha has made significant strides in integrating the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme, specifically the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), with its own health initiative, the Gopabandhu Jan Arogya Yojana (G-JAY). This integration is aimed at enhancing healthcare access and coverage for the state's population.\n\n1. **Implementation Timeline**: The Odisha government plans to implement the AB-PMJAY by the end of the current financial year, with a target completion date set for March 2025. This timeline reflects the state's commitment to ensuring that the benefits of the scheme reach its citizens promptly.\n\n2. **Coverage Expansion**: The integration of AB-PMJAY with G-JAY is expected to provide health coverage for nearly one crore families in Odisha. This merger will allow approximately 3.5 crore individuals to benefit from the combined health insurance schemes, which offer cashless treatment for various medical procedures across 27 specialties.\n\n3. **Financial Protection**: Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, families are entitled to health coverage of up to â‚¹5 lakh per year for secondary and tertiary care. This financial protection is particularly crucial for low-income families, as it acts as a lifeline during medical emergencies.\n\n4. **Single Card System**: A notable feature of this integration is the introduction of a single card for beneficiaries, which will streamline access to health services. This initiative is expected to simplify the process for individuals seeking medical care under both schemes.\n\n5. **Focus on Senior Citizens**: The Odisha government is prioritizing the identification of beneficiaries aged 70 and above, ensuring that this vulnerable group receives the necessary health coverage under the integrated scheme.\n\nOverall, the integration of the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme with Odisha's G-JAY represents a significant milestone in the state's healthcare journey, aiming to improve health outcomes and accessibility for its residents.
