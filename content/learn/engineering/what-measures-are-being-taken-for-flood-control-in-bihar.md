    What measures are being taken for flood control in Bihar?
answer: >-
    In the Union Budget 2024-25, significant measures have been announced for flood control in Bihar, reflecting the state's ongoing challenges with flooding, particularly from rivers such as the Kosi, Gandak, and Ganga. The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has allocated â‚¹11,500 crore specifically for flood mitigation efforts in the state. This allocation is seen as a crucial step, especially given the state's geographic vulnerability and the historical impact of floods, which are often exacerbated by heavy rainfall in upstream regions like Nepal.\n\nKey initiatives include:\n\n1. **Flood Management Information System (FMIS)**: This project aims to enhance the technical and institutional capacity of the state for effective flood management. It includes improved flood forecasting capabilities, which are essential for timely warnings and better preparedness.\n\n2. **Kosi Flood Forecasting and Early Warning System (Kosi-FFEWS)**: This system is being implemented to provide accurate and timely flood forecasts, helping to mitigate the impact of floods on communities and infrastructure.\n\n3. **Strengthening Flood Management Capacity**: The Water Resources Department of the Government of Bihar is tasked with implementing various components of flood management projects, which include fortifying embankments and spurs along critical rivers.\n\n4. **World Bank Support**: The Bihar Kosi Basin Development project, supported by the World Bank, has been instrumental in transforming flood management in the region. This project focuses on strategic infrastructure improvements to protect communities from flooding.\n\nOverall, the Union Budget's emphasis on flood control measures is part of a broader strategy to address the vulnerabilities faced by Bihar and to enhance the resilience of its infrastructure and communities against natural disasters.
