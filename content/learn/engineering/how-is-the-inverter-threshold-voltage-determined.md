    How is the inverter threshold voltage determined?
answer: >-
    The inverter threshold voltage, often referred to as the switching threshold voltage ($V_M$), is determined by the point on the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) curve where the output voltage ($V_{out}$) equals the input voltage ($V_{in}$). This point is also known as the midpoint voltage and is critical for characterizing the inverter's performance.\n\nTo calculate the threshold voltage, the following steps are typically followed:\n\n1. **Identify the VTC**: The VTC is a plot of $V_{out}$ versus $V_{in}$ for the inverter. The threshold voltage is the point where this curve intersects the line defined by $V_{out} = V_{in}$.\n\n2. **Equate Drain Currents**: In a CMOS inverter, at the threshold voltage, the drain current of the n-channel MOSFET ($I_{Dn}$) is equal to the drain current of the p-channel MOSFET ($I_{Dp}$). This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$ I_{Dn} = I_{Dp} $$\n\n3. **Saturation Region Analysis**: The threshold voltage can be derived from the equations governing the MOSFETs in saturation. For an n-channel MOSFET, the drain current can be expressed as:\n   $$ I_{D} = \frac{1}{2} k_n (V_{GS} - V_{tn})^2 $$\n   where $k_n$ is the process transconductance parameter and $V_{tn}$ is the threshold voltage of the n-channel MOSFET. A similar equation applies for the p-channel MOSFET.\n\n4. **Solve for $V_M$**: By substituting the expressions for $I_{Dn}$ and $I_{Dp}$ into the equation and solving for $V_M$, you can express it in terms of the device parameters and supply voltage ($V_{dd}$).\n\n5. **Consider Noise Margins**: The threshold voltage is also influenced by the noise margins of the inverter, which are defined as the difference between the input and output levels at which the inverter reliably switches states.\n\nIn summary, the inverter threshold voltage is a crucial parameter that can be determined by analyzing the VTC and equating the drain currents of the n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs at the point where $V_{out} = V_{in}$. This voltage is typically around half of the supply voltage ($V_{dd}/2$) in symmetric designs, but can vary based on the specific characteristics of the transistors used.
