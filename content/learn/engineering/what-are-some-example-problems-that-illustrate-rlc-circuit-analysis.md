    What are some example problems that illustrate RLC circuit analysis?
answer: >-
    Here are some example problems that illustrate RLC circuit analysis, focusing on both series and parallel configurations:\n\n### Series RLC Circuit Example Problems\n\n1. **Example Problem 1:**\n   A series RLC circuit consists of a resistor (R) of 12Ω, an inductor (L) of 0.15H, and a capacitor (C) of 100μF connected across a 100V, 50Hz supply. \n   - **Tasks:**\n     - Calculate the total circuit impedance (Z).\n     - Determine the circuit's current (I).\n     - Find the power factor (PF).\n     - Draw the voltage phasor diagram.\n\n   **Solution Steps:**\n   - Calculate the inductive reactance ($X_L = 2\pi f L$) and capacitive reactance ($X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}$).\n   - Use the formula for total impedance: \n     $$ Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2} $$\n   - Calculate the current using Ohm's law: \n     $$ I = \frac{V}{Z} $$\n   - Determine the power factor: \n     $$ PF = \cos(\phi) = \frac{R}{Z} $$\n\n2. **Example Problem 2:**\n   Given a series RLC circuit with parameters: L = 1.0 µH, C = 10.0 nF, R = 100Ω, and a source voltage of 220 V.\n   - **Tasks:**\n     - Determine the resonant frequency ($f_0$) of the circuit.\n     - Calculate the amplitude of the current at resonance.\n\n   **Solution Steps:**\n   - Calculate the resonant frequency using the formula: \n     $$ f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} $$\n   - At resonance, the impedance is purely resistive, so the current can be calculated as: \n     $$ I_{resonance} = \frac{V}{R} $$\n\n### Parallel RLC Circuit Example Problems\n\n1. **Example Problem 3:**\n   In a parallel RLC circuit, the total current is 150 mA, and the current through the inductor is 100 mA. \n   - **Tasks:**\n     - Determine the applied voltage (V).\n     - Given that the frequency is 50 Hz, find the value of L.\n\n   **Solution Steps:**\n   - Use Kirchhoff's current law to find the current through the resistor and capacitor: \n     $$ I_R + I_C = I_{total} - I_L $$\n   - Calculate the voltage across the inductor using: \n     $$ V = I_L \cdot X_L $$\n   - Rearranging gives: \n     $$ L = \frac{V}{2\pi f I_L} $$\n\nThese example problems cover fundamental concepts in RLC circuit analysis, including impedance calculations, resonant frequency, and current relationships in both series and parallel configurations. They can serve as practice for students preparing for exams or homework assignments in electrical engineering.
