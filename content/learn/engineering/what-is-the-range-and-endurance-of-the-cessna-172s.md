    What is the range and endurance of the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The Cessna 172S Skyhawk has an operational range of approximately 660 nautical miles (NM) when flying with one passenger and a pilot. This range allows for non-stop flights between major cities, such as from Denver to Indianapolis or from Houston to Minneapolis. \n\nIn terms of endurance, the Cessna 172S can remain airborne for about 4 to 5 hours, depending on factors such as weight, fuel consumption, and flight conditions. The endurance is influenced by the aircraft's fuel capacity, which is 56 U.S. gallons, with 53 gallons being usable for flight. \n\nThese specifications highlight the Cessna 172S's versatility and efficiency, making it a popular choice for both training and personal flying.
