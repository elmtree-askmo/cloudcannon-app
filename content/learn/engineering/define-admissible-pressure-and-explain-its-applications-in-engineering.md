answer: >-
    Admissible pressure, also known as allowable pressure, refers to the maximum pressure that a material or component can withstand without experiencing failure. This value is critical in engineering design and analysis, as it ensures that structures and mechanical components operate safely under expected loads.\n\n### Definition and Importance\n\nThe admissible pressure is determined through material testing and is typically provided in material property tables. It is essential for ensuring that the materials used in construction or manufacturing can handle the pressures they will encounter during operation. The relationship between the acting pressure and the admissible pressure can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\np_{atuante} \leq p_{admissível}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ p_{atuante} $ is the acting pressure (the pressure that the component will experience during operation),\n- $ p_{admissível} $ is the admissible pressure (the maximum pressure the material can safely withstand).\n\n### Applications in Engineering\n\n1. **Design of Mechanical Components**: Engineers must ensure that the materials and geometries selected for components, such as keys, couplings, and other assemblies, can withstand the expected pressures without failing. This involves referencing tables or standards that provide the admissible pressures for different materials and configurations.\n\n2. **Safety Assessments**: Admissible pressure is crucial for safety assessments in various engineering applications. By ensuring that the acting pressure does not exceed the admissible pressure, engineers can prevent catastrophic failures that could lead to accidents or structural collapses.\n\n3. **Material Selection**: When selecting materials for construction or manufacturing, understanding the admissible pressure helps engineers choose materials that are not only strong enough but also appropriate for the specific application, considering factors like weight, cost, and environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Failure Analysis**: In the event of a failure, understanding the admissible pressure can help engineers analyze the cause of the failure and improve future designs to prevent similar issues.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, admissible pressure is a fundamental concept in engineering that ensures the safety and reliability of materials and components under pressure. By adhering to the criteria set by admissible pressure, engineers can design safer and more effective systems across various applications.
