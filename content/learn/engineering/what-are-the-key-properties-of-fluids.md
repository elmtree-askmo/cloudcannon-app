    What are the key properties of fluids?
answer: >-
    The key properties of fluids can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Fluid Definition**: Fluids are substances that cannot sustain a tangential or shearing force when at rest and will continuously change shape when subjected to such stress. This includes both liquids and gases.\n\n2. **Viscosity**: Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. It describes how much a fluid resists the movement of one layer over another. For example, water has low viscosity, while molasses has high viscosity. Fluids can be classified as Newtonian (constant viscosity) or non-Newtonian (viscosity varies with shear rate or time).\n\n3. **Density**: Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a fluid. It is a crucial property that influences whether an object will sink or float in a fluid.\n\n4. **Pressure**: Pressure in a fluid is defined as the normal force exerted per unit area. It acts perpendicular to any surface in contact with the fluid and is uniform in all directions at a given point within the fluid.\n\n5. **Surface Tension**: This property arises from cohesive forces between molecules at the surface of a liquid, causing it to behave like a stretched membrane. Water, for instance, has a high surface tension due to strong hydrogen bonding.\n\n6. **Steady vs. Unsteady Fluids**: A steady fluid maintains constant density at every point during flow, while an unsteady fluid has varying velocity and density at different points.\n\n7. **Compressibility**: Fluids can be classified as compressible or incompressible based on their response to pressure changes. Incompressible fluids have a Mach number less than 0.3, meaning their density remains relatively constant under pressure changes.\n\n8. **Buoyancy**: This property relates to the upward force exerted by a fluid on an object submerged in it, which is explained by Archimedes' Principle. It states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\n9. **Fluid Dynamics**: This area studies the behavior of fluids in motion, governed by principles such as the continuity equation, which states that the mass of a fluid remains constant as it flows.\n\nThese properties are fundamental in understanding fluid mechanics and have numerous applications in engineering, natural phenomena, and various industries.
