    What is the role of visible lines in orthographic projection?
answer: >-
    In orthographic projection, visible lines play a crucial role in accurately representing the shape and form of an object. These lines are typically thick, solid lines that outline the edges and boundaries of the object as seen from a particular view. Their primary functions include:\n\n1. **Clarity and Communication**: Visible lines help convey the essential features of the object, ensuring that anyone reading the drawing can easily understand what is being depicted. They are drawn darker than other types of lines, which enhances their visibility and importance in the drawing.\n\n2. **Defining Shape and Structure**: Visible lines outline the object's contours, allowing for a clear representation of its dimensions and geometry. This is particularly important in technical drawings, where precise communication of design intent is necessary.\n\n3. **Hierarchy of Line Types**: In cases where multiple edges project to the same line on the drawing, visible lines take precedence over hidden lines and center lines. This means that if a visible edge and a hidden edge overlap, the visible line will be represented as a solid line, ensuring that the most critical information is communicated first.\n\n4. **Distinction from Other Lines**: Visible lines are differentiated from hidden lines (which are represented by dashed lines to indicate features not visible in the current view) and center lines (which denote the centers of symmetrical features). This distinction is vital for accurately interpreting the drawing.\n\nOverall, visible lines are fundamental in orthographic projection as they provide a clear and accurate depiction of the object's visible features, facilitating effective communication in engineering and design contexts.
