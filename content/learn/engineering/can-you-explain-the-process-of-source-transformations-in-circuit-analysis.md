answer: >-
    Source transformation is a fundamental technique in circuit analysis that simplifies the analysis of electrical circuits by converting between equivalent voltage and current sources. This process is based on Ohm's Law and the principles outlined in Thévenin's and Norton's theorems.\n\n### Definition\nSource transformation involves replacing a voltage source ($V_s$) in series with a resistor ($R_s$) by an equivalent current source ($I_s$) in parallel with the same resistor ($R_p$), or vice versa. This means that you can convert a Thévenin equivalent circuit into a Norton equivalent circuit and vice-versa.\n\n### Process of Source Transformation\n1. **Voltage to Current Conversion**: \n   - If you have a voltage source $V_s$ in series with a resistor $R_s$, the equivalent current source $I_s$ can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   I_s = \frac{V_s}{R_s}\n   $$\n   The resistor $R_s$ remains in parallel with the current source.\n\n2. **Current to Voltage Conversion**: \n   - Conversely, if you have a current source $I_s$ in parallel with a resistor $R_p$, the equivalent voltage source $V_s$ can be calculated as:\n   $$\n   V_s = I_s \cdot R_p\n   $$\n   The resistor $R_p$ remains in series with the voltage source.\n\n### Example\nConsider a circuit with a voltage source of 30 V in series with a 3 Ω resistor. The equivalent current source would be:\n$$\nI_s = \frac{30 \, \text{V}}{3 \, \Omega} = 10 \, \text{A}\n$$\nThis current source would then be in parallel with a 3 Ω resistor.\n\n### Limitations\nThere are certain situations where source transformation cannot be applied:\n- When the voltage source has zero resistance, the current source would theoretically become infinite, which is not practical.\n- When dealing with dependent sources, care must be taken to ensure that the transformation does not alter the behavior of the dependent elements.\n\n### Conclusion\nSource transformation is a powerful tool in circuit analysis that allows for the simplification of complex circuits by converting between voltage and current sources while maintaining the same circuit behavior. This technique is particularly useful in solving circuits with multiple sources and resistors, making it easier to analyze and understand the overall circuit dynamics.
