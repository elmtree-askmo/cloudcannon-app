    How are brazing techniques classified and what are the related processes?
answer: >-
    Brazing techniques are classified based on several criteria, primarily focusing on the heating method used to achieve the necessary temperature for the filler metal to flow into the joint. Here are the main classifications and related processes:\n\n### Classification of Brazing Techniques\n\n1. **By Heating Method**:\n   - **Localized Heating Techniques**: These methods heat only the joint area. An example is **Torch Brazing**, which is one of the most commonly used methods. It involves using a flame torch to melt the filler metal and join the components.\n   - **Diffuse Heating Techniques**: These methods heat the entire assembly, such as in **Furnace Brazing**, where the entire assembly is placed in a furnace to reach the brazing temperature.\n\n2. **By Temperature**:\n   - **High-Temperature Brazing**: Conducted above 800°C.\n   - **Medium-Temperature Brazing**: Conducted between 550°C and 800°C.\n   - **Low-Temperature Brazing**: Conducted below 500°C.\n\n3. **By Heat Source Type**:\n   - **Flame Brazing**: Utilizes a gas torch.\n   - **Induction Brazing**: Uses electromagnetic induction to heat the metal.\n   - **Resistance Brazing**: Involves passing an electric current through the joint to generate heat.\n   - **Furnace Brazing**: The assembly is heated in a furnace.\n   - **Soldering Iron Brazing**: Uses a soldering iron as the heat source.\n\n### Related Processes\n\n- **Joint Design**: The design of brazed joints is crucial for ensuring strength and dimensional accuracy. Common joint forms include plate brazing, T-shape and bevel brazing, tube or bar and plate, wire contact brazing, and pipe brazing.\n- **Filler Metals**: The choice of filler metal is essential, with common types including copper-based alloys and silver-based alloys. Silver brazing, also known as "hard soldering," is a low-temperature process that uses silver-based filler metals with melting points ranging from 618°C to 899°C.\n- **Fluxes**: Fluxes are often used in brazing to prevent oxidation and improve the flow of the filler metal.\n\n### Applications of Brazing\n\nBrazing is widely used in various industries for joining metals, including applications in automotive, aerospace, and electronics, where maintaining the mechanical properties of the base metals is critical.\n\nIn summary, brazing techniques are classified based on heating methods, temperature ranges, and heat sources, with various related processes that enhance the effectiveness and application of brazing in metal joining.
