    How is model preparation conducted in manual molding processes?
answer: >-
    In manual molding processes, model preparation is a critical step that involves creating a master model from which the mold will be formed. This process typically includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Selection of Material for the Model**: The master model can be made from various materials, including modeling clay, plasticine, wood, or wax. The choice of material often depends on the complexity of the design and the required precision.\n\n2. **Model Creation**: The model is crafted to reflect the desired shape and dimensions of the final casting. This requires artistic or technical skills, as the model must accurately represent the features of the intended product.\n\n3. **Preparation of the Molding Area**: Once the model is ready, the molding area is prepared. This involves setting up a molding frame and applying a release agent to the model to ensure that the mold can be easily removed after it has cured.\n\n4. **Mold Formation**: The next step is to create the mold itself. In manual molding, sand mixed with binders is packed around the model. This is done using simple manual tools to tamp the sand firmly, ensuring that it takes the shape of the model.\n\n5. **Curing**: After the sand is packed around the model, it is allowed to cure. This step is crucial as it solidifies the mold, making it ready for the casting process.\n\n6. **Mold Assembly**: If a two-part mold is required, the two halves are carefully assembled to form the complete mold cavity. Proper alignment is essential to ensure the quality and accuracy of the final casting.\n\n7. **Final Checks**: Before proceeding to the casting phase, the mold is inspected for any defects or misalignments that could affect the casting quality.\n\nOverall, manual molding processes are characterized by their flexibility and the ability to produce small series of castings, making them suitable for custom or low-volume production runs.
