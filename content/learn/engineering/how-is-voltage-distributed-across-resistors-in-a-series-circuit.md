    How is voltage distributed across resistors in a series circuit?
answer: >-
    In a series circuit, the voltage is distributed across the resistors according to their resistances. This distribution can be understood through Ohm's Law and the concept of voltage drops.\n\n### Key Points on Voltage Distribution in Series Circuits:\n\n1. **Same Current Through All Resistors**: In a series circuit, the same current flows through each resistor. This is a fundamental characteristic of series circuits.\n\n2. **Voltage Division**: The total voltage supplied by the source is divided among the resistors. The voltage drop across each resistor can be calculated using Ohm's Law, which states:\n   $$\n   V = IR\n   $$\n   where $ V $ is the voltage drop across the resistor, $ I $ is the current flowing through it, and $ R $ is the resistance of that resistor.\n\n3. **Total Voltage**: The sum of the voltage drops across all resistors in the series circuit equals the total voltage supplied by the source. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \ldots + V_n\n   $$\n   where $ V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n $ are the voltage drops across each resistor.\n\n4. **Calculating Voltage Drops**: If you have multiple resistors in series, the voltage drop across each resistor can be calculated as follows:\n   - For a circuit with two resistors $ R_1 $ and $ R_2 $ connected in series to a voltage source $ V_{total} $:\n     - The total resistance $ R_{total} $ is:\n     $$\n     R_{total} = R_1 + R_2\n     $$\n     - The current $ I $ through the circuit is:\n     $$\n     I = \frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}\n     $$\n     - The voltage drop across $ R_1 $ is:\n     $$\n     V_1 = I \cdot R_1\n     $$\n     - The voltage drop across $ R_2 $ is:\n     $$\n     V_2 = I \cdot R_2\n     $$\n\n### Example Calculation:\nSuppose you have a series circuit with a 30-volt battery and two resistors: $ R_1 = 4 \, \Omega $ and $ R_2 = 6 \, \Omega $.\n\n1. Calculate the total resistance:\n   $$\n   R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \, \Omega\n   $$\n\n2. Calculate the current using Ohm's Law:\n   $$\n   I = \frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}} = \frac{30 \, V}{10 \, \Omega} = 3 \, A\n   $$\n\n3. Calculate the voltage drop across each resistor:\n   - For $ R_1 $:\n   $$\n   V_1 = I \cdot R_1 = 3 \, A \cdot 4 \, \Omega = 12 \, V\n   $$\n   - For $ R_2 $:\n   $$\n   V_2 = I \cdot R_2 = 3 \, A \cdot 6 \, \Omega = 18 \, V\n   $$\n\n4. Verify the total voltage:\n   $$\n   V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 = 12 \, V + 18 \, V = 30 \, V\n   $$\n\nThis example illustrates how voltage is distributed across resistors in a series circuit, confirming that the total voltage is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops.
