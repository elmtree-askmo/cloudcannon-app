    What are the primary raw materials used in the production of gypsum?
answer: >-
    The primary raw material used in the production of gypsum is gypsum rock, which is chemically known as calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO₄·2H₂O). This naturally occurring mineral is abundant worldwide and is formed through geological processes, particularly the evaporation of seawater. Gypsum rock is typically found in beds that can range in thickness from a few centimeters to several tens of meters.\n\nIn addition to natural gypsum rock, gypsum can also be produced as a byproduct of the flue-gas desulfurization process at electric power plants. This method provides an economical and environmentally friendly source of gypsum for manufacturing high-quality gypsum products, such as gypsum boards.\n\nOverall, the main raw materials for gypsum production include:\n1. Gypsum rock (calcium sulfate dihydrate).\n2. Byproduct gypsum from flue-gas desulfurization processes.\n\nThese materials are essential for the manufacturing of various gypsum-based products, including wallboard, plasters, and other construction materials.
