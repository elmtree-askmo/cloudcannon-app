    What are the common test input signals used in performance measures of control systems?
answer: >-
    In control systems, common test input signals used to evaluate performance measures include:\n\n1. **Impulse Signal**: This signal is characterized by a sudden spike at a single point in time, typically represented mathematically as a Dirac delta function, $\delta(t)$. It is useful for determining the impulse response of a system, which provides insights into the system's stability and dynamic characteristics.\n\n2. **Step Signal**: The step function represents an instantaneous change in the input, transitioning from zero to a constant value. This is often used to analyze how a system responds to a sudden change in input, allowing for the assessment of transient and steady-state behaviors.\n\n3. **Ramp Signal**: A ramp input increases linearly over time, which helps in evaluating the system's response to a continuously changing input. This signal is particularly useful for assessing the system's ability to track changes over time.\n\n4. **Parabolic Signal**: This input increases quadratically over time and is used to test the system's response to accelerating inputs. It helps in understanding how well the system can handle inputs that change at an increasing rate.\n\nThese standard test signals are essential for analyzing and designing control systems, as they allow engineers to define performance measures such as rise time, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error. By applying these inputs, one can evaluate the time response of the system and gain insights into its overall performance.
