    What are the typical power consumption values for household devices?
answer: >-
    Typical power consumption values for household devices can vary significantly based on the type of appliance and its usage. Here are some common household appliances along with their estimated wattage:\n\n1. **Light Bulb (Common)**: 75 W\n2. **Space Heater**: 1,800 W\n3. **Ceiling Fan**: 60-70 W\n4. **Dehumidifier**: 240 W\n5. **Electric Stove**: 2,000 W\n6. **Electric Heater Fan**: 2,000-3,000 W\n7. **Refrigerator**: 100-800 W (actual consumption may be lower due to compressor cycling)\n8. **Air Conditioner**: 1,000-4,000 W (actual consumption may be 40%-50% of calculated value due to compressor operation)\n9. **Electric Boiler**: 4,000-14,000 W\n10. **Electric Mower**: 1,500 W\n11. **Electric Shaver**: 15-20 W\n12. **Electric Blanket**: 200 W\n13. **Crock-Pot/Slow Cooker**: 100-300 W\n14. **Food Processor**: 300-800 W\n15. **Electric Grill**: 1,200-1,800 W\n\nIt's important to note that the actual power consumption of these appliances can differ based on various factors, including usage patterns, efficiency ratings, and specific models. For instance, appliances with compressors, like refrigerators and air conditioners, may only draw their maximum power for a fraction of the time they are in operation, leading to lower average consumption. \n\nUnderstanding these values can help homeowners manage their energy usage and costs effectively.
