    What is the solubility of gypsum in water?
answer: >-
    The solubility of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO₄·2H₂O) in water at 25°C is estimated to range from approximately 0.0147 to 0.0182 M. This variation is influenced by experimental conditions and the ability of gypsum to form supersaturated solutions. In terms of mass, gypsum is moderately soluble in water, with solubility values around 2.0 to 2.5 g/L at the same temperature. Notably, gypsum exhibits retrograde solubility, meaning it becomes less soluble as the temperature increases. This unique property is important in various applications, including its use in construction and agriculture.
