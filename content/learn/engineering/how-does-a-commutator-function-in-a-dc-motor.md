    How does a commutator function in a DC motor?
answer: >-
    A commutator is a crucial component in DC motors, functioning as a rotary electrical switch that reverses the direction of current flow in the motor's windings. This mechanism is essential for the continuous rotation of the motor.\n\nIn a DC motor, the commutator is connected to the armature, which rotates within a magnetic field. As the armature turns, the commutator segments periodically change their connection to the brushes, which are fixed contacts that supply current. This switching occurs every half turn of the armature, ensuring that the current direction in the windings is reversed. This reversal is vital because it maintains a unidirectional torque, allowing the motor to rotate smoothly and continuously.\n\nThe commutator essentially acts as a mechanical rectifier, converting the alternating current generated in the armature into direct current for the external circuit. Without the commutator, the motor would not be able to sustain its rotational motion, as the torque would alternate and potentially cause the motor to stop.\n\nIn summary, the commutator's primary functions in a DC motor include:\n1. Reversing the direction of current flow in the armature windings every half turn.\n2. Ensuring continuous and smooth rotation by maintaining unidirectional torque.\n3. Acting as a mechanical rectifier to convert AC voltage generated in the armature into DC voltage for the external circuit.\n\nThis mechanism is fundamental to the operation of DC motors, making the commutator an integral part of their design and functionality.
