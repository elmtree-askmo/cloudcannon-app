    What is the vector representation of displacement in three-dimensional space?
answer: >-
    In three-dimensional space, the vector representation of displacement is defined as the difference between the position vectors of two points. If we denote the initial position vector as \(\vec{r}(t_1)\) and the final position vector as \(\vec{r}(t_2)\), the displacement vector $\Delta \vec{r}$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}(t_2) - \vec{r}(t_1)\n$$\n\nThis vector $\Delta \vec{r}$ represents the shortest distance and direction from the initial point to the final point in three-dimensional space. \n\nFor example, if point A has coordinates \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and point B has coordinates \((x_2, y_2, z_2)\), the displacement vector from A to B can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\Delta \vec{r} = (x_2 - x_1) \hat{i} + (y_2 - y_1) \hat{j} + (z_2 - z_1) \hat{k}\n$$\n\nHere, $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ are the unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. This representation captures both the magnitude and direction of the displacement in three-dimensional space.\n\nIn summary, the displacement vector is a crucial concept in kinematics and dynamics, as it provides a clear representation of how far and in what direction an object has moved from one point to another in three-dimensional space.
