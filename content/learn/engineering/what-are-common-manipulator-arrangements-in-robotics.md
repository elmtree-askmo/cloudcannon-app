    What are common manipulator arrangements in robotics?
answer: >-
    Common manipulator arrangements in robotics refer to the specific configurations of joints and links that allow robotic systems to perform various tasks. The most prevalent types of robotic manipulators include:\n\n1. **Cartesian Manipulators**: These manipulators operate along three linear axes (X, Y, and Z) and are known for their straightforward geometry. They excel in tasks requiring high precision, such as placing electronic components on circuit boards.\n\n2. **Cylindrical Manipulators**: Featuring a combination of rotary and linear movements, cylindrical manipulators are less complex to program compared to articulated systems. They are often used in applications where vertical and horizontal movements are required.\n\n3. **SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm)**: SCARA manipulators are designed for fast, precise horizontal movements and operate best within a specific plane. They are commonly used in assembly tasks where speed and accuracy are critical.\n\n4. **Articulated Manipulators**: These are the most widely recognized type of robotic manipulators, characterized by multiple revolute joints that allow for a wide range of motion. They are versatile and can perform complex tasks in manufacturing environments.\n\n5. **Delta Manipulators**: Known for their parallel kinematic structure, delta manipulators are designed for high-speed operations and are often used in pick-and-place applications.\n\n6. **Polar Manipulators**: These manipulators utilize a combination of rotary and linear movements, allowing them to operate in a spherical workspace. They are suitable for tasks that require a wide range of motion.\n\nEach of these manipulator types has its unique advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the task at hand, such as precision, speed, and the complexity of movements needed. Understanding these arrangements is crucial for designing effective robotic systems that can efficiently perform desired operations.
