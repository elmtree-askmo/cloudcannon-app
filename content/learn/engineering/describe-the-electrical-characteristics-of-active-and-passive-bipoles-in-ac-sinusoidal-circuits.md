    In alternating current (AC) sinusoidal circuits, the electrical characteristics of active and passive bipoles are fundamentally different, reflecting their roles in the circuit.\n\n### Active Bipoles\nActive bipoles, such as generators or power sources, are characterized by their ability to supply energy to the circuit. Their key electrical characteristics include:\n\n1. **Voltage Source Behavior**: Active bipoles maintain a constant voltage across their terminals, regardless of the current drawn by the load. This is crucial for providing a stable power supply.\n\n2. **Power Generation**: They convert other forms of energy (mechanical, chemical, etc.) into electrical energy. In AC circuits, they produce sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms.\n\n3. **Phase Relationship**: In ideal conditions, the voltage and current produced by active bipoles are in phase. However, in real-world applications, there may be some phase shift due to internal impedance.\n\n4. **Power Factor**: Active bipoles can influence the power factor of the circuit, which is the ratio of active power (real power) to apparent power. A higher power factor indicates more efficient energy usage.\n\n### Passive Bipoles\nPassive bipoles, which include resistors, inductors, and capacitors, do not generate energy but rather consume it. Their electrical characteristics are as follows:\n\n1. **Energy Consumption**: Passive bipoles absorb energy from the circuit. Resistors convert electrical energy into heat, while inductors and capacitors store energy temporarily in magnetic and electric fields, respectively.\n\n2. **Impedance**: Each type of passive bipole has a specific impedance that affects how they respond to AC signals:\n   - **Resistors (R)**: Have a constant impedance, independent of frequency, and dissipate power as heat.\n   - **Inductors (L)**: Impedance increases with frequency, leading to a lagging current relative to voltage. They store energy in a magnetic field.\n   - **Capacitors (C)**: Impedance decreases with frequency, causing the current to lead the voltage. They store energy in an electric field.\n\n3. **Phase Shift**: Passive bipoles introduce phase shifts in the current relative to the voltage:\n   - Resistors have no phase shift (0 degrees).\n   - Inductors cause the current to lag the voltage by 90 degrees.\n   - Capacitors cause the current to lead the voltage by 90 degrees.\n\n4. **Power Factor**: Passive bipoles can also affect the power factor of the circuit, particularly inductors and capacitors, which can introduce reactive power (non-working power) into the system.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, active bipoles are energy sources that supply power and maintain voltage, while passive bipoles are energy consumers that affect the circuit's impedance and phase relationships. Understanding these characteristics is essential for analyzing and designing AC circuits effectively, particularly in terms of power factor correction and overall circuit efficiency.
