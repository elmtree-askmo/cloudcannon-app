    What are the standard testing methods for assessing the granulometry of aggregates?
answer: >-
    The standard testing methods for assessing the granulometry of aggregates primarily include sieve analysis, which is essential for determining the particle size distribution (gradation) of both fine and coarse aggregates. The following are key methods and standards used in this process:\n\n1. **AASHTO T27**: This is a standard test method used to determine the particle size distribution of aggregates. It involves passing the aggregate sample through a series of sieves with different openings and measuring the weight retained on each sieve. The results are crucial for quality control in asphalt and concrete mixtures.\n\n2. **ASTM C136**: This standard outlines the procedure for sieve analysis, which is critical for maintaining building material standards. The test involves the same methodology as AASHTO T27, where the aggregate sample is sieved, and the weight retained on each sieve is recorded to create a gradation curve.\n\n3. **Test Method C117**: This method is often used in conjunction with sieve analysis to determine the amount of material finer than the 75-Âµm (No. 200) sieve. It is particularly important for aggregates with a nominal maximum size of 12.5 mm (1/2 in.) or less.\n\n4. **European Standard EN 933**: This standard sets mandatory testing procedures for the determination of physical properties of aggregates, including sieve analysis as a key method for assessing granulometry.\n\nThe sieve analysis procedure involves the following steps:\n- The aggregate sample is dried and then passed through a series of sieves with progressively smaller mesh sizes.\n- The amount of material retained on each sieve is weighed.\n- The percentage of aggregate retained on each sieve is calculated and plotted to obtain a gradation curve, which visually represents the relative proportions of different sizes.\n\nThese testing methods are essential for ensuring compliance with specification requirements and for controlling the production of various aggregate products and mixtures used in construction.
