    What are the main components of an electric battery?
answer: >-
    An electric battery is an energy storage device that consists of one or more electrochemical cells. The main components of an electric battery include:\n\n1. **Anode**: This is the negative terminal of the battery where oxidation occurs, releasing electrons into the external circuit.\n\n2. **Cathode**: This is the positive terminal of the battery where reduction occurs, accepting electrons from the external circuit.\n\n3. **Electrolyte**: A chemical medium that allows the flow of ions between the anode and cathode. In many modern batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte is often a lithium salt solution.\n\n4. **Separator**: A micro-permeable barrier that keeps the anode and cathode apart to prevent short-circuiting while allowing ionic movement.\n\n5. **Current Collectors**: These components facilitate the transfer of electrons to and from the external circuit.\n\n6. **Battery Casing**: The outer shell that houses all the internal components and protects them from environmental factors.\n\n7. **Terminal Connectors**: The points of connection for the battery to external circuits, allowing it to deliver electrical energy to devices.\n\nThese components work together to convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy, enabling the battery to power various electrical devices. Understanding these components is crucial for grasping how batteries function, especially in applications like electric vehicles and portable electronics.
