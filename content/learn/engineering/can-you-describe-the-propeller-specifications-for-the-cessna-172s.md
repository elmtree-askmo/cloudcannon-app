    Can you describe the propeller specifications for the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The Cessna 172S is equipped with a McCauley propeller, which has the following specifications:\n\n- **Manufacturer**: McCauley Propeller Systems\n- **Number of Blades**: 2\n- **Propeller Diameter**: 76 inches\n- **Propeller Type**: Fixed pitch\n\nThese specifications are essential for understanding the performance characteristics of the aircraft, as the propeller plays a crucial role in its thrust and efficiency during flight. The fixed-pitch design means that the angle of the blades is set and cannot be adjusted in flight, which is typical for many general aviation aircraft like the Cessna 172S.
