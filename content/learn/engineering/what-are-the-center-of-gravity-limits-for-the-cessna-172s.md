    What are the center of gravity limits for the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The center of gravity (CG) limits for the Cessna 172S are as follows:\n\n- **Forward Limit**: 35.0 inches aft of the datum at a maximum weight of 1,950 pounds or less.\n- **Aft Limit**: The CG limit varies linearly to 41.0 inches aft of the datum at a maximum weight of 2,550 pounds.\n\nThis means that as the weight of the aircraft increases from 1,950 pounds to 2,550 pounds, the allowable center of gravity moves from 35.0 inches to 41.0 inches aft of the datum. It is crucial for pilots to ensure that the aircraft's loading complies with these limits to maintain safe flight characteristics. Always refer to the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for the specific aircraft being operated for the most accurate and detailed information.
