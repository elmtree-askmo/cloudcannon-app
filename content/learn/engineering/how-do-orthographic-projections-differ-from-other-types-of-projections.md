    How do orthographic projections differ from other types of projections?
answer: >-
    Orthographic projections differ from other types of projections primarily in how they represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Parallel vs. Perspective**: Orthographic projection is a type of parallel projection where the projection lines are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the projection plane. This means that the size and shape of the objects are preserved without distortion. In contrast, perspective projection involves projecting lines that converge at a point (the viewer's eye), which results in a representation that mimics human visual perception, causing objects to appear smaller as they are further away.\n\n2. **Preservation of Dimensions**: In orthographic projection, the true dimensions of the object are maintained. This is particularly useful in technical drawings, as it allows for accurate measurements to be taken directly from the drawing. On the other hand, perspective projection does not preserve true dimensions; objects may appear foreshortened or distorted based on their distance from the viewer.\n\n3. **Types of Views**: Orthographic projection typically includes multiple views (such as front, top, and side views) that are arranged to provide a comprehensive understanding of the object's geometry. Each view is projected onto a plane that is perpendicular to the principal axes of the object. In contrast, perspective projection usually presents a single view that captures the object as it would appear to the human eye, often including depth cues.\n\n4. **Applications**: Orthographic projections are widely used in engineering, architecture, and CAD (Computer-Aided Design) because they provide clear and accurate representations of objects. They are essential for creating detailed technical drawings. Perspective projections, while useful for visualizations and artistic representations, are less practical for precise measurements and technical specifications.\n\nIn summary, the main differences between orthographic and other types of projections, particularly perspective projection, lie in the preservation of dimensions, the nature of the projection lines, and the types of views presented. Orthographic projection is essential for technical applications where accuracy is paramount, while perspective projection is more suited for visual representation.
