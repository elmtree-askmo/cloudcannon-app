    What is an offset section and when is it used?
answer: >-
    An **offset section** is a type of sectional view used in engineering graphics to illustrate features of an object that do not lie in the same plane. This is achieved by bending the cutting plane, allowing the section view to include multiple features that are offset from one another. \n\n### When is it Used?\nOffset sections are particularly useful when:\n- The features of interest are not aligned along a straight line, making it difficult to represent them accurately in a standard section view.\n- It is necessary to show internal details that are spaced apart, such as bolt holes or other components that are not in a direct line with each other.\n\nFor example, if a cutting plane is drawn to pass through two bolt holes that are not aligned, an offset section would be employed to ensure both holes are visible in the sectional view. This technique enhances the clarity of the drawing by allowing the viewer to see multiple relevant features in a single view, rather than requiring separate sections for each feature.\n\n### Visual Representation\nWhen creating an offset section, the cutting plane line is drawn with bends to indicate the path it takes through the object. This line can be represented in either horizontal or vertical segments, depending on the orientation of the features being depicted. The resulting section view is then placed appropriately in relation to the standard views of the object, often accompanied by hatching to indicate the cut surfaces.\n\nIn summary, offset sections are a valuable tool in engineering graphics for effectively communicating complex internal features of an object in a clear and concise manner.
