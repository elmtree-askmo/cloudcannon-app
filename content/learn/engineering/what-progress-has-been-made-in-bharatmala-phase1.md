    What progress has been made in Bharatmala Phase-1?
answer: >-
    Bharatmala Phase-I is a significant highway development initiative approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in October 2017, aimed at enhancing the road infrastructure across India. The project originally planned for the development of 34,800 km of National Highways (NH) at an estimated cost of ₹5.35 lakh crore.\n\nAs of December 2023, substantial progress has been made in the implementation of Bharatmala Phase-I:\n\n1. **Project Awards and Completion**: Approximately 26,418 km (76% of the planned length) have been awarded for construction, with about 15,549 km completed. This indicates a significant advancement in the project, although it still has a considerable amount of work left to be done.\n\n2. **Financial Aspects**: The estimated cost of the project has seen a dramatic increase, now approaching nearly ₹11 trillion, which reflects over a 100% rise from the initial estimates. This increase has been attributed to various factors, including rising costs and financial constraints.\n\n3. **Revised Deadlines**: The government has extended the deadline for the completion of Bharatmala Phase-I to 2027-28. This extension is a response to the slower-than-expected implementation pace and the increased financial requirements.\n\n4. **Audit and Monitoring**: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) released an audit report on August 10, 2023, assessing the planning, financial management, and implementation of 66 sampled projects under Phase-I. The audit covered the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21, highlighting the need for improved monitoring and management practices.\n\n5. **Future Projections**: The remaining projects under Bharatmala Phase-I are targeted for award by the financial year 2024-25, with ongoing efforts to mobilize resources and streamline project execution.\n\nOverall, while significant progress has been made in terms of project awards and construction, challenges related to cost escalation and implementation timelines remain critical issues that the government is addressing as it moves forward with Bharatmala Phase-I.
