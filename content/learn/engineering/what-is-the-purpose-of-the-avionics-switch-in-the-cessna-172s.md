    What is the purpose of the avionics switch in the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The purpose of the avionics switch in the Cessna 172S is to control the power supply to the avionics systems, specifically the avionics buses. The avionics switch allows pilots to turn on or off the electrical power to these systems, which include navigation, communication, and other essential flight instruments.\n\nDuring the engine start procedure, it is recommended to turn off the avionics buses (AVIONICS BUS 1 and AVIONICS BUS 2) to protect the avionics from potential electrical transients that can occur when the engine is cranked. This helps prevent damage to sensitive electronic equipment. After the engine is started, the avionics switch can be turned on to power the avionics systems for normal operation.\n\nIn summary, the avionics switch is crucial for managing the electrical power to the avionics systems, ensuring their protection during engine start, and facilitating their operation during flight.
