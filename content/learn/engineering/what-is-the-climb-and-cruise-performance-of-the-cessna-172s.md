    What is the climb and cruise performance of the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The Cessna 172S Skyhawk is known for its reliable performance, particularly in climb and cruise phases. Here are the key specifications regarding its climb and cruise performance:\n\n### Climb Performance\n- **Rate of Climb**: The Cessna 172S has a maximum rate of climb of approximately 730 feet per minute (FPM) at sea level under standard conditions.\n- **Best Angle of Climb Speed (Vx)**: The best angle of climb speed is 62 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) with flaps up.\n- **Climb Ceiling**: The maximum service ceiling for the Cessna 172S is around 14,000 feet.\n\n### Cruise Performance\n- **Cruise Speed**: At 75% power, the Cessna 172S can achieve a true airspeed (TAS) of approximately 123 knots at sea level.\n- **Fuel Flow**: The fuel flow during cruise at this power setting is about 10.2 gallons per hour (GPH).\n- **Cruise Altitude**: The aircraft is typically flown at altitudes up to 10,000 feet for optimal performance, although it can reach up to 14,000 feet.\n\n### Additional Performance Metrics\n- **Takeoff Distance**: The takeoff distance required for the Cessna 172S is approximately 960 feet under standard conditions with a 50-foot obstacle.\n- **Landing Distance**: The landing distance is about 575 feet.\n\nThese performance metrics make the Cessna 172S a popular choice for flight training and general aviation due to its efficiency and reliability.
