    What is the primary function of a water hammer arrestor in a plumbing system?
answer: >-
    The primary function of a water hammer arrestor in a plumbing system is to absorb shock waves caused by sudden changes in water flow, such as when a valve closes quickly. This phenomenon, known as water hammer, can lead to loud banging noises and potential damage to pipes and fixtures. \n\nWater hammer arrestors are typically installed near fixtures that are prone to experiencing water hammer, such as washing machines, dishwashers, and toilets. They consist of a sealed chamber filled with air or gas, which compresses when a shock wave travels through the plumbing system. This compression acts as a cushion, reducing the intensity of the pressure spike and thereby preventing damage to the plumbing infrastructure.\n\nIn summary, water hammer arrestors are essential components that help maintain the integrity of plumbing systems by mitigating the adverse effects of pressure surges, reducing noise, and enhancing the longevity and reliability of the system. Regular maintenance checks are recommended to ensure they are functioning correctly, as the air or gas within the arrestor can dissipate over time, diminishing its effectiveness.
