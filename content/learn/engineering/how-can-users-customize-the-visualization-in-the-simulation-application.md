    How can users customize the visualization in the simulation application?
answer: >-
    Users can customize the visualization in the gear simulation application in several ways, enhancing their experience and understanding of gear systems. Here are the key customization options available:\n\n1. **Background Customization**: Users can change the background color of the simulation environment. This feature allows for better visibility and can be adjusted according to personal preferences or to improve contrast with the gears being visualized.\n\n2. **Grid Visibility**: The application provides an option to display a grid within the simulation. This grid can assist users in aligning gears accurately and helps in visualizing the spatial relationships between different components.\n\n3. **Labeling of Gears**: Users have the ability to display names or numbers on the gears. This labeling feature aids in easier identification of each gear, especially in complex systems where multiple gears are present.\n\n4. **Modifiable Gear Properties**: Users can adjust various properties of the gears, such as the number of teeth and the pressure angle. These modifications not only affect the functionality of the gears but also how they are visually represented in the simulation.\n\n5. **Creating and Modifying Gears**: The application allows users to add new gears and modify existing ones. This includes setting specific teeth counts and other characteristics, which can be visually represented in the simulation.\n\n6. **Simulation Controls**: While not strictly a visualization feature, the ability to pause and rewind animations allows users to focus on specific moments in the simulation, enhancing their understanding of gear interactions.\n\nThese customization options enable users to tailor the simulation environment to their needs, making it easier to analyze and understand the dynamics of gear systems.
