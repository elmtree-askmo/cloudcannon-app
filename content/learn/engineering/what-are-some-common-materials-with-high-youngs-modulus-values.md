    What are some common materials with high Young's Modulus values?
answer: >-
    Young's Modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material, indicating how much it will deform under stress. Common materials with high Young's Modulus values include:\n\n1. **Metals**:\n   - **Steel**: Approximately 200 GPa\n   - **Titanium**: Around 116 GPa\n   - **Aluminum**: About 70 GPa\n   - **Copper**: Approximately 110 GPa\n\n2. **Ceramics**:\n   - **Alumina (Al2O3)**: Typically around 300 GPa\n   - **Silicon Carbide (SiC)**: Approximately 400 GPa\n\n3. **Composites**:\n   - **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)**: Can range from 70 GPa to over 200 GPa depending on the specific formulation.\n\n4. **Other Materials**:\n   - **Glass**: Generally around 70-90 GPa\n   - **Concrete**: Approximately 30 GPa\n\nThese values can vary based on the specific type of material and its treatment or processing. For example, different grades of steel or aluminum alloys may exhibit different Young's Modulus values. \n\nIn summary, materials like metals and ceramics typically exhibit high Young's Modulus values, making them suitable for applications requiring rigidity and strength.
