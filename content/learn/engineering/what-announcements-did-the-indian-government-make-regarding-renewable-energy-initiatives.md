    What announcements did the Indian government make regarding renewable energy initiatives?
answer: >-
    The Indian government has made several significant announcements regarding renewable energy initiatives aimed at accelerating the transition to a green energy economy. Here are the key initiatives and measures:\n\n1. **Green Energy Corridor Scheme**: The government is laying new transmission lines and creating additional sub-station capacity under this scheme to facilitate the evacuation of renewable power. This is crucial for integrating renewable energy sources into the national grid.\n\n2. **Green Term Ahead Market**: A new market has been launched to facilitate the sale of renewable energy through exchanges, enhancing the trading of renewable energy and providing more options for consumers.\n\n3. **Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO)**: The government has notified RPO targets for designated consumers, which will progressively increase the minimum share of renewable energy in the energy mix. By 2024-25, it is mandated that 29.91% of total energy must come from renewable sources.\n\n4. **Financial Support for Renewable Projects**: The government has set a target of achieving 500 GW of installed capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Financial institutions have pledged to provide $386 billion in funding for renewable projects by 2030.\n\n5. **Subsidies and Incentives**: In FY 2023, the government ramped up subsidies for renewable energy to INR 14,843 crore (approximately USD 1.8 billion), marking an 8% increase from the previous year. This is part of a broader strategy to support the energy transition through targeted policies and incentives.\n\n6. **International Solar Alliance**: The Indian government is providing INR 100 crore per year to the International Solar Alliance for the financial years 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 to promote renewable energy globally, particularly in developing economies.\n\n7. **PM Surya Ghar Yojana**: This initiative aims to install rooftop solar plants in one crore households with a total financial outlay of ₹75,021 crore, to be implemented until FY27.\n\n8. **Ambitious Solar Capacity Goals**: The government has allocated ₹6,900.68 crores to achieve a target of producing 280 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, which includes both grid-interactive and off-grid projects.\n\nThese initiatives reflect India's commitment to enhancing its renewable energy capacity and transitioning towards a more sustainable energy future.
