    What is the primary function of rectangular keys in mechanical assemblies?
answer: >-
    The primary function of rectangular keys in mechanical assemblies is to securely connect rotating shafts to other machine elements, ensuring the effective transmission of power while preventing relative motion between the components. Rectangular keys, which have a rectangular cross-section, are specifically designed to fit into keyways and keyseats on both the shaft and the hub of the connected component.\n\nHere are some key points regarding rectangular keys:\n\n1. **Power Transmission**: Rectangular keys are known for their high power transmission capacity compared to other types of keys, such as saddle keys. This makes them suitable for applications where significant torque is involved.\n\n2. **Keyway and Keyseat**: For a rectangular key to function properly, both the shaft and the hub must have corresponding keyways (longitudinal slots) and keyseats (pockets) where the key fits tightly. This tight fit is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the connection under operational loads.\n\n3. **Types of Keys**: Rectangular keys are one of several types of sunk keys, which also include square sunk keys, parallel sunk keys, gib head keys, feather keys, and Woodruff keys. Each type has its specific applications and advantages.\n\n4. **Cost Consideration**: While rectangular keys provide high power transmission capabilities, the requirement for machining keyways in both the shaft and the hub can increase manufacturing costs.\n\n5. **Protection Against Motion**: By securing the hub to the shaft, rectangular keys help protect components from unwanted movement, which can lead to mechanical failure or inefficiencies in power transmission.\n\nIn summary, rectangular keys are essential components in mechanical assemblies, facilitating the reliable transfer of torque and ensuring that connected parts operate cohesively without slipping or misalignment.
