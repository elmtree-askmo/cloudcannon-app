    How does Newton's First Law of Motion describe the concept of inertia?
answer: >-
    Newton's First Law of Motion, often referred to as the law of inertia, describes the concept of inertia as the tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. This principle can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Inertia Defined:** Inertia is the property of matter that causes it to resist changes in its state of motion. An object with greater mass has greater inertia, meaning it requires a larger force to change its motion compared to an object with less mass.\n\n- **First Law Statement:** The law states that:\n  - An object at rest will remain at rest.\n  - An object in motion will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed.\n  - Both scenarios will only change if an external force is applied.\n\nThis law emphasizes that motion is not inherently linked to the presence of forces; rather, forces are necessary to change the motion of an object. For example, a book lying on a table will not move unless someone applies a force to push it. Similarly, a hockey puck sliding on ice will continue to slide in a straight line until friction or another force stops it.\n\nIn summary, Newton's First Law of Motion encapsulates the concept of inertia by illustrating that objects resist changes to their motion, highlighting the fundamental relationship between force and motion in mechanics.
