    What are the main components of a circuito elétrico?
answer: >-
    The main components of a circuito elétrico (electric circuit) include:\n\n1. **Bipole**: A two-terminal electrical component that can be either active (like generators) or passive (like loads). Examples include resistors, capacitors, and light bulbs.\n\n2. **Electric Circuit**: A closed loop that allows electric current to flow. It is formed by connecting various electrical components together.\n\n3. **Branch**: A part of a circuit that connects two or more components. Each branch can carry a portion of the total current.\n\n4. **Node**: A point in a circuit where two or more components are connected. Nodes are crucial for analyzing circuit behavior.\n\n5. **Loop**: A closed path in a circuit that can be traversed without crossing any branch more than once. Loops are important for applying Kirchhoff's laws.\n\n6. **Mesh**: A loop that does not contain any other loops within it. Mesh analysis is a method used to solve circuit problems.\n\n7. **Voltage Source**: A component, such as a battery or power supply, that provides electrical energy to the circuit.\n\n8. **Conductors**: Wires or traces that allow current to flow through the circuit, connecting various components.\n\n9. **Electrical Components**: Devices that perform specific functions in a circuit, such as resistors (which limit current), capacitors (which store energy), and inductors (which store energy in a magnetic field).\n\n10. **Electric Current**: The flow of electric charge through the circuit, which is essential for powering devices.\n\n11. **Electric Power**: The rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit, calculated using the formula $P = VI$, where $P$ is power, $V$ is voltage, and $I$ is current.\n\nThese components work together to create a functioning electric circuit, allowing for the flow of current and the operation of electrical devices. Understanding these components is fundamental for designing and troubleshooting circuits.
