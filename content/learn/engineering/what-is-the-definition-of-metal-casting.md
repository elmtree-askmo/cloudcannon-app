    What is the definition of metal casting?
answer: >-
    Metal casting is defined as a manufacturing process in which molten metal is poured into a mold that contains a hollow cavity of a desired geometrical shape. Once the molten metal is introduced into the mold, it is allowed to cool and solidify, forming a solidified part. This process has been utilized for over 6000 years and is particularly valued for its ability to create complex and large parts that may be difficult or impossible to produce using other metalworking methods.\n\nThe term 'casting' not only refers to the process itself but also to the final product that results from this process. Metal casting is a versatile technique widely used in various industries, including manufacturing and fine arts, to produce a range of components and artistic pieces. The method is known for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, allowing manufacturers to save significantly on production costs compared to other methods such as welding and machining.
