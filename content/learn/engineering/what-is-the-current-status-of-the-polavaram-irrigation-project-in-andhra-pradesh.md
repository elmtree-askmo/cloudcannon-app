    What is the current status of the Polavaram Irrigation Project in Andhra Pradesh?
answer: >-
    The Polavaram Irrigation Project is currently under construction on the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh, specifically in the Eluru and East Godavari Districts. It has been designated as a National project by the Central Government of India. As of October 2024, the project has experienced significant delays, with a time overrun of 72 months and a cost overrun of approximately 447.22%. \n\nThe project aims to create a gross irrigation potential of 436,825 hectares, generate 960 MW of hydropower, and provide drinking water to a population of approximately 2.85 million across 611 villages. Recent reports indicate that critical works related to the project are ongoing, including the construction of a new diaphragm wall and depletion channel works for dewatering the main dam area.\n\nThe Andhra Pradesh government has committed to completing the project by March 2028, emphasizing its importance as a "lifeline" for the state. A white paper detailing the project's status and any irregularities is expected to be released soon, reflecting ongoing scrutiny and public interest in the project's progress. \n\nOverall, while the Polavaram Irrigation Project is a significant initiative for irrigation and water supply in Andhra Pradesh, it continues to face challenges related to delays and cost overruns.
