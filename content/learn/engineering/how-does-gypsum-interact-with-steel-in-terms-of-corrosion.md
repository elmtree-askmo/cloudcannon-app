    How does gypsum interact with steel in terms of corrosion?
answer: >-
    Gypsum, when in contact with steel, can lead to significant corrosion, particularly due to its pH value, which is close to neutral (around 7). This characteristic can create an environment conducive to corrosion, especially for bare and galvanized steel. Studies have shown that the corrosion rates of these types of steel in gypsum are notably higher than those observed in mortar, with differences reaching up to two orders of magnitude. \n\nThe presence of humidity further exacerbates the corrosion process; as humidity increases, so does the corrosion rate, regardless of the water-to-gypsum ratio. This indicates that moisture plays a critical role in the interaction between gypsum and steel, leading to accelerated deterioration of the metal.\n\nIn summary, gypsum can significantly affect steel by promoting corrosion, particularly under humid conditions, and this effect is more pronounced compared to other materials like mortar. This information is crucial for applications where gypsum is used in conjunction with steel, as it highlights the need for protective measures to mitigate corrosion risks.
