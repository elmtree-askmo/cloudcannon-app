    How do electric cell and battery symbols differ in circuit diagrams?
answer: >-
    In circuit diagrams, the symbols for electric cells and batteries differ primarily in their representation and the number of cells they depict.\n\n1. **Cell Symbol**: The symbol for a single cell is typically represented by a long line (positive terminal) and a short line (negative terminal). This symbol indicates a single unit that converts chemical energy into electrical energy, usually with a voltage of around 0.5V.\n\n2. **Battery Symbol**: The battery symbol, on the other hand, is represented by two or more cell symbols connected in series. This indicates that a battery consists of multiple cells working together to provide a higher voltage. The battery symbol is often depicted with alternating long and short lines, where each pair of lines represents an individual cell.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that the cell symbol represents a single unit, while the battery symbol represents a collection of cells. This distinction is crucial for accurately interpreting circuit diagrams and understanding the power sources used in electrical circuits.
