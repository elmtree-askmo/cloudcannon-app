    How do harmful substances in aggregates impact the durability of concrete?
answer: >-
    Harmful substances in aggregates can significantly impact the durability of concrete through various mechanisms. These substances may react chemically with Portland cement, leading to several detrimental effects:\n\n1. **Volume Change**: Certain deleterious materials can cause significant volume changes in the cement paste or aggregates. This can lead to cracking and structural failure over time, as the expansion or contraction may create internal stresses that the concrete cannot withstand.\n\n2. **Interference with Hydration**: Some harmful substances can interfere with the normal hydration process of cement. This disruption can result in incomplete hydration, leading to a weaker concrete matrix that is more susceptible to environmental damage.\n\n3. **Production of Hazardous Byproducts**: The reaction of harmful substances with cement can produce additional byproducts that may be detrimental to the concrete's integrity. For example, alkali-silica reactions can occur when reactive silica in aggregates interacts with alkalis in cement, leading to expansion and cracking.\n\n4. **Unsound Particles**: The presence of unsound particles, such as mica, in large quantities (over 2 to 5% of the aggregate mass) can adversely affect the strength of concrete. Mica, for instance, has been shown to reduce concrete strength significantly, with studies indicating a 15% reduction in compressive strength when 5% mica is present.\n\n5. **Chemical Attack**: Harmful chemicals, such as chlorides and sulfates, can penetrate concrete and lead to corrosion of reinforcing steel, which compromises the structural integrity of the concrete. Deicing salts, commonly used in cold climates, can exacerbate this issue by increasing the permeability of concrete, allowing these harmful chemicals to infiltrate more easily.\n\n6. **Water Quality**: The quality of water used in the concrete mix is also crucial. Poor water quality can introduce harmful substances that adversely affect the concrete's long-term performance, leading to issues such as corrosion and reduced durability.\n\nIn summary, the presence of harmful substances in aggregates can lead to various issues that compromise the durability and longevity of concrete structures. It is essential to conduct thorough testing and quality control measures to minimize the presence of these deleterious materials in concrete aggregates.
