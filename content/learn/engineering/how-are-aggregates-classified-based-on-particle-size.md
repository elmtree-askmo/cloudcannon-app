    How are aggregates classified based on particle size?
answer: >-
    Aggregates are classified based on particle size into three main categories: fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, and filler materials. \n\n1. **Fine Aggregates**: These are aggregates that pass through a 4.75 mm sieve. Common examples include sand and silt. Fine aggregates are essential for filling the voids between coarse aggregates and contribute to the workability of concrete and mortar.\n\n2. **Coarse Aggregates**: These aggregates have a nominal size greater than 4.75 mm. They can be further classified based on their nominal size, such as 40 mm, 20 mm, 16 mm, and 12.5 mm. Coarse aggregates include materials like gravel, crushed stone, and blast furnace slag. The classification of coarse aggregates is often based on their grading, which refers to the distribution of particle sizes within the aggregate.\n\n3. **Filler Materials**: These are very fine aggregates that are used to fill voids in the concrete mix, typically consisting of particles smaller than 0.075 mm.\n\nThe classification of aggregates based on size is crucial because it influences the performance of construction materials, including their strength, durability, and workability. Proper gradation, which is the distribution of particle sizes, is essential for achieving high packing density and uniformity in concrete, thereby preventing segregation of particles.\n\nIn summary, aggregates are primarily classified into fine and coarse categories based on their particle size, with specific nominal sizes defining the coarse aggregates. This classification plays a significant role in the applications of aggregates in civil construction.
