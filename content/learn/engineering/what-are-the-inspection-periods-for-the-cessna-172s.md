    What are the inspection periods for the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The inspection periods for the Cessna 172S include both annual inspections and 100-hour inspections, which are critical for maintaining the aircraft's airworthiness.\n\n1. **Annual Inspection**: This is a comprehensive inspection that must be performed every 12 calendar months. It covers a wide range of components and systems to ensure the aircraft is safe and compliant with regulatory standards.\n\n2. **100-Hour Inspection**: This inspection is required for aircraft that are used for hire or flight instruction. It must be conducted every 100 flight hours and is similar in scope to the annual inspection but may be less comprehensive depending on the specific operational use of the aircraft.\n\nIn addition to these periodic inspections, routine maintenance tasks such as oil changes and spark plug servicing are typically performed every 50 hours of operation, regardless of the inspection schedule. This helps ensure the aircraft remains in good working condition between the more extensive inspections.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific requirements and procedures for inspections can vary based on the aircraft's operational history and any applicable Airworthiness Directives (ADs). Therefore, it is advisable for owners and operators to refer to the Cessna 172S maintenance manual and consult with a certified A&P mechanic for detailed guidance on inspection schedules and requirements.
