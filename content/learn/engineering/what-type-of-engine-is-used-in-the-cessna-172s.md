    What type of engine is used in the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    The Cessna 172S is powered by a Textron Lycoming IO-360-L2A engine. This engine is a normally aspirated, direct drive, air-cooled, horizontally opposed, fuel-injected, four-cylinder engine with a displacement of 360 cubic inches (approximately 5.9 liters). It produces 120 kW (160 hp) and drives a two-blade fixed-pitch McCauley propeller. This configuration contributes to the aircraft's performance and reliability, making it a popular choice for flight training and general aviation.
