    How do you calculate the total resistance in a parallel circuit?
answer: >-
    To calculate the total resistance in a parallel circuit, you can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n}\n$$\n\nWhere $ R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n $ are the resistances of the individual resistors connected in parallel.\n\nFor example, if you have three resistors with resistances of $ R_1 = 10 \, \Omega $, $ R_2 = 15 \, \Omega $, and $ R_3 = 20 \, \Omega $, you would calculate the total resistance as follows:\n\n1. Find the reciprocals of each resistance:\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667 $\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 $\n\n2. Sum the reciprocals:\n   - $ 0.1 + 0.0667 + 0.05 \approx 0.2167 $\n\n3. Take the reciprocal of the sum to find $ R_{\text{total}} $:\n   - $ R_{\text{total}} \approx \frac{1}{0.2167} \approx 4.62 \, \Omega $\n\nThis method can be applied to any number of resistors in parallel. If you have only two resistors, the formula simplifies to:\n\n$$\nR_{\text{total}} = \frac{R_1 \times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\n$$\n\nThis approach allows you to effectively calculate the total resistance in a parallel circuit, which is always less than the smallest individual resistor in the circuit.
