    How does current flow differ between series and parallel circuits?
answer: >-
    The flow of current in series and parallel circuits differs significantly due to their distinct configurations and characteristics.\n\n### Series Circuits\n1. **Current Flow**: In a series circuit, there is only one path for the current to flow. This means that the same current flows through each component connected in the circuit. If you have multiple resistors (or any components) in series, the current remains constant throughout the entire circuit.\n   \n2. **Voltage Distribution**: The total voltage supplied by the power source is divided among the components. The voltage drop across each component can be calculated using Ohm's Law ($V = IR$), where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance of the component.\n\n3. **Total Resistance**: The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances:\n   $$\n   R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots\n   $$\n   This increase in total resistance results in a decrease in the overall current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's Law.\n\n### Parallel Circuits\n1. **Current Flow**: In a parallel circuit, there are multiple paths for the current to flow. Each component is connected across the same two points, allowing the current to divide among the branches. The total current flowing from the power source is the sum of the currents through each parallel branch:\n   $$\n   I_{\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \ldots\n   $$\n\n2. **Voltage Distribution**: The voltage across each component in a parallel circuit is the same and equal to the voltage of the power source. This means that each component experiences the same voltage, regardless of its resistance.\n\n3. **Total Resistance**: The total resistance in a parallel circuit is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots\n   $$\n   Adding more branches decreases the total resistance, which in turn increases the total current drawn from the power source.\n\n### Summary\n- **In Series Circuits**: Current is constant, voltage is divided, and total resistance increases with more components.\n- **In Parallel Circuits**: Voltage is constant across components, current is divided among branches, and total resistance decreases with more branches.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for circuit analysis and design, as they affect how electrical energy is distributed and utilized in various applications.
