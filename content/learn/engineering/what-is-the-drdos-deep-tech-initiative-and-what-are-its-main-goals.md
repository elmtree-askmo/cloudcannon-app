    The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has launched the Deep Tech Initiative, which aims to advance emerging military technologies and promote the indigenization of defense products in India. This initiative is backed by a substantial corpus of ₹1 lakh crore, which is intended to support transformative research in various high-tech areas.\n\nThe main goals of the DRDO's Deep Tech Initiative include:\n\n1. **Indigenization of Defense Products**: The initiative seeks to reduce India's reliance on imported defense technologies by fostering the development of indigenous solutions.\n\n2. **Funding High-Value Projects**: DRDO plans to fund five deep-tech projects, with each project receiving up to ₹50 crore. This funding is aimed at encouraging innovation and research in critical areas.\n\n3. **Focus on Emerging Technologies**: The initiative emphasizes the development of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, robotics, cyber security, unmanned systems, and advanced materials. These technologies are expected to significantly enhance India's defense capabilities.\n\n4. **Collaboration with Industry and Academia**: DRDO is collaborating with private sector industries, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and academic institutions to leverage their expertise and resources in the development of deep tech solutions.\n\n5. **Strengthening National Security**: By promoting the development of cutting-edge technologies, the initiative aims to bolster India's national security and military readiness.\n\nOverall, the DRDO's Deep Tech Initiative represents a strategic effort to position India as a leader in defense technology innovation while ensuring self-reliance in military capabilities.
