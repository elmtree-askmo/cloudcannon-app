answer: >-
    In machining environments, the basic and mandatory personal protective equipment (PPE) required to ensure safety includes:\n\n1. **Safety Glasses**: Protective eyewear is essential to shield the eyes from flying debris, chips, and other hazards that may occur during machining operations.\n\n2. **Closed-Toe Shoes**: Footwear that covers the toes is crucial to protect the feet from falling objects and other potential hazards present in the workshop.\n\n3. **Short-Sleeved Lab Coats**: These are recommended to provide a layer of protection while allowing for ease of movement. Long-sleeved shirts are generally prohibited due to the risk of entanglement in machinery.\n\n4. **Long Pants**: Wearing long pants is important to protect the legs from sharp objects and other workshop hazards.\n\n5. **Prohibited Attire**: Certain clothing items are not allowed in the workshop for safety reasons, including sandals, high heels, and shorts, as they do not provide adequate protection.\n\nThese PPE items are critical for minimizing exposure to hazards in machining environments and ensuring the safety of personnel working with machinery.
