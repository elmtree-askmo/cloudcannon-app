    What is the process of grinding by crushing in gypsum production?
answer: >-
    The process of grinding by crushing in gypsum production is a critical step in the overall manufacturing process of gypsum powder. Here’s a detailed overview of this process:\n\n1. **Gypsum Mining**: The process begins with the extraction of gypsum from the ground. Gypsum is typically mined using surface mining techniques, where large deposits are accessed.\n\n2. **Crushing**: Once the gypsum is extracted, it undergoes crushing to break down large rocks into smaller, manageable pieces. This is done using a crusher, which reduces the size of the gypsum chunks significantly. The size of the crushed gypsum is crucial as it affects the efficiency of the subsequent grinding process.\n\n3. **Grinding**: After crushing, the smaller gypsum pieces are fed into a grinding mill. In this stage, the crushed material is finely ground into a powder. The grinding process further reduces the size of the gypsum particles, ensuring that they meet the required fineness for the next steps in the production line.\n\n4. **Calcination**: Following grinding, the gypsum powder is subjected to calcination, where it is heated in a kiln at temperatures between 150-180°C. This process removes moisture and converts the gypsum into calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO₄·½H₂O), commonly known as plaster of Paris.\n\n5. **Cooling and Final Grinding**: After calcination, the gypsum is cooled and may undergo additional grinding to achieve the desired particle size and consistency before being stored or packaged for use in various applications.\n\nThis multi-step process ensures that the gypsum is adequately prepared for its various applications, including the production of gesso, plaster, and drywall. Each stage, from crushing to grinding, plays a vital role in determining the quality and usability of the final gypsum product.
