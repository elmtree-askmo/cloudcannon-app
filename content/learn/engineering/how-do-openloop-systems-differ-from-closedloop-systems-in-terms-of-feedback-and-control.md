    How do open-loop systems differ from closed-loop systems in terms of feedback and control?
answer: >-
    Open-loop and closed-loop systems are two fundamental types of control systems that differ primarily in their use of feedback.\n\n1. **Feedback Mechanism**:\n   - **Open-Loop Systems**: These systems do not utilize feedback. The control actions are independent of the output produced. This means that once the input is set, the system operates without adjusting based on the output. For example, a simple electric toaster operates on a timer; it does not adjust its heating based on the actual toast color.\n   - **Closed-Loop Systems**: In contrast, closed-loop systems incorporate feedback to adjust their control actions based on the output. This means that the system continuously monitors its output and makes necessary adjustments to the input control to maintain the desired output level. For instance, a thermostat-controlled heating system adjusts the heating based on the temperature reading from the environment.\n\n2. **Dependence on Output**:\n   - In an open-loop system, the desired output does not depend on the control action. The system operates solely based on the initial input, and any variations in output are not corrected. \n   - Conversely, in a closed-loop system, the control action is dependent on the output. The feedback mechanism allows the system to correct any deviations from the desired output, enhancing accuracy and stability.\n\n3. **Complexity**:\n   - Open-loop systems are generally simpler in construction and operation since they do not require additional components for feedback. \n   - Closed-loop systems are more complex as they require components such as sensors, controllers, and feedback paths to function effectively.\n\n4. **Performance and Accuracy**:\n   - Open-loop systems may be less accurate, especially in the presence of disturbances or changes in system dynamics, as they cannot adjust to these variations.\n   - Closed-loop systems tend to be more accurate and reliable because they can adapt to changes and minimize errors through feedback.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between open-loop and closed-loop systems lies in the presence of feedback, which allows closed-loop systems to adjust their control actions based on the output, leading to improved performance and accuracy.
