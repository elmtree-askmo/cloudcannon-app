    What are the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy resources?
answer: >-
    The key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy resources can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Replenishment**:\n   - **Renewable Energy**: These resources can replenish naturally over time. Examples include solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal energy. They are sustainable when used responsibly, meaning they do not lead to depletion.\n   - **Non-Renewable Energy**: These resources are finite and cannot be replaced once depleted. Examples include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as nuclear energy sources like uranium and plutonium.\n\n2. **Environmental Impact**:\n   - **Renewable Energy**: Generally, renewable energy sources have a lower environmental impact. They contribute less to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, making them more favorable in the context of climate change and environmental sustainability.\n   - **Non-Renewable Energy**: The extraction and use of non-renewable energy sources often lead to significant environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, habitat destruction, and increased carbon emissions, which contribute to global warming.\n\n3. **Energy Generation Capacity**:\n   - **Renewable Energy**: While renewable sources are becoming increasingly efficient, they typically generate less energy per unit of space compared to non-renewable sources. Their output can also be variable, depending on environmental conditions (e.g., sunlight, wind).\n   - **Non-Renewable Energy**: These sources are more concentrated and can generate a larger amount of energy per unit of resource, making them currently more reliable for meeting high energy demands.\n\n4. **Health Impacts**:\n   - **Renewable Energy**: Generally considered to be less harmful to human health, as they do not produce harmful emissions during operation.\n   - **Non-Renewable Energy**: The combustion of fossil fuels releases pollutants that can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues in the population.\n\n5. **Long-term Viability**:\n   - **Renewable Energy**: With advancements in technology and increasing investment, renewable energy is seen as a long-term solution to meet global energy needs sustainably.\n   - **Non-Renewable Energy**: As these resources are finite, their long-term viability is limited, and reliance on them poses risks of energy shortages and price volatility as they become scarcer.\n\nIn summary, renewable energy sources offer sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives to non-renewable sources, which are finite and have significant negative impacts on health and the environment. The transition towards renewable energy is essential for addressing climate change and ensuring a sustainable energy future.
