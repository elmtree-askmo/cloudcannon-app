    How does the number of teeth on a gear affect its speed and torque?
answer: >-
    The number of teeth on a gear significantly affects both its speed and torque due to the principles of gear ratios and mechanical advantage.\n\n### Speed\nThe speed of a gear is inversely related to the number of teeth it has. When two gears are meshed together, the relationship between their rotational speeds can be expressed using the gear ratio, which is defined as:\n\n$$\n\text{Gear Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of Teeth on Larger Gear}}{\text{Number of Teeth on Smaller Gear}}\n$$\n\nFor example, if you have a pinion gear (smaller gear) with 25 teeth and a crown gear (larger gear) with 50 teeth, the gear ratio would be:\n\n$$\n\text{Gear Ratio} = \frac{50}{25} = 2\n$$\n\nThis means that for every complete rotation of the pinion, the crown gear will only complete half a rotation. Therefore, the pinion gear rotates faster than the crown gear, demonstrating that a gear with fewer teeth will rotate more quickly than a gear with more teeth.\n\n### Torque\nTorque, on the other hand, is directly related to the gear ratio. The torque relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nT_{\text{output}} = T_{\text{input}} \times \text{Gear Ratio}\n$$\n\nThis means that as the speed of the output gear decreases (due to a higher number of teeth), the torque increases. For instance, if the input torque on the pinion is 10 Nm, and the gear ratio is 2, the output torque on the crown gear would be:\n\n$$\nT_{\text{output}} = 10 \, \text{Nm} \times 2 = 20 \, \text{Nm}\n$$\n\nThus, while the pinion gear rotates faster, it produces less torque compared to the crown gear, which rotates slower but produces more torque.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, increasing the number of teeth on a gear results in a decrease in its rotational speed while increasing its torque. This inverse relationship between speed and torque is a fundamental principle in gear mechanics, allowing for the design of systems that can either prioritize speed or torque based on the application requirements.
