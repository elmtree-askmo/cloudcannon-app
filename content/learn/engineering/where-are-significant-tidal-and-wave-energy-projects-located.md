    Where are significant tidal and wave energy projects located?
answer: >-
    Significant tidal and wave energy projects are located in various regions around the world, showcasing the potential of these renewable energy sources. Here are some notable projects:\n\n### Tidal Energy Projects\n\n1. **MeyGen Project, Scotland, UK**: \n   - Location: Pentland Firth\n   - Capacity: 398 MW\n   - Description: Currently under construction, it is expected to power up to 175,000 homes and will be the largest tidal power facility in the world upon completion.\n\n2. **Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, United Kingdom**:\n   - Capacity: 240 MW\n   - Description: This project, once completed, will be one of the largest tidal power projects globally. The planning application was approved in March 2013.\n\n3. **Bay of Fundy, Canada**:\n   - Operational since: 2018\n   - Planned capacity: 0.28 MW\n   - Description: Known for having the largest tidal range in the world, the Bay of Fundy has potential for significant tidal energy generation, although large-scale projects have yet to be realized.\n\n4. **Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station, South Korea**:\n   - Description: An engineering marvel that has been operational and is a notable facility in Asia for tidal power technology.\n\n5. **Eastport Project, Maine, USA**:\n   - Description: This project is part of the United States' exploration of tidal energy opportunities.\n\n### Wave Energy Projects\n\n1. **Lysekil Project, Sweden**:\n   - Location: West coast, south of Lysekil\n   - Description: An ongoing wave energy research project with multiple wave energy converters (WECs) deployed since 2006.\n\n2. **Billia Croo, Orkney, Scotland**:\n   - Description: This site has some of the highest wave energy potentials in Europe, with test berths for wave energy projects.\n\n3. **Wave Energy Quest, Australia**:\n   - Description: Australia is making significant strides in wave energy technology, leveraging its vast coastline and ocean currents.\n\n4. **Mossel Bay, South Africa**:\n   - Description: The robust wave activity around the Cape Peninsula is being explored for wave energy extraction, positioning South Africa as a significant player in this domain.\n\n5. **Taiwan**:\n   - Description: I-Ke has identified locations for pilot wave energy stations on the east coast, with plans for additional sites.\n\nThese projects illustrate the global interest and investment in tidal and wave energy as viable renewable energy sources, each contributing to the transition towards sustainable energy solutions.
