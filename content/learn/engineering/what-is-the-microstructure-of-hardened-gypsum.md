    What is the microstructure of hardened gypsum?
answer: >-
    The microstructure of hardened gypsum is characterized by a porous structure that significantly influences its mechanical properties. Key aspects of this microstructure include:\n\n1. **Pore Structure**: Hardened gypsum paste exhibits a complex pore structure, which is crucial for understanding its strength and durability. The pore size distribution is an essential parameter, with an increase in the size of macro-pores (greater than 1Î¼m) being observed, which can lead to a reduction in strength. This deterioration in pore structure is often exacerbated by the presence of additives such as retarders and accelerators, which can alter the hydration kinetics and water distribution within the gypsum matrix.\n\n2. **Water Distribution**: Studies utilizing proton NMR relaxation have shown that the water confined within the porous structure of hardened gypsum varies with different water-to-plaster ratios. This water distribution is vital for the hydration process and affects the overall microstructure and mechanical properties of the hardened gypsum.\n\n3. **Comparison to Portland Cement**: The microstructure of hardened gypsum shares similarities with that of hardened Portland cement pastes. This comparison highlights the importance of understanding the microstructural changes that occur during the setting and hardening processes, which can inform better practices in construction and material science.\n\n4. **Mechanical Properties**: The mechanical strength of hardened gypsum develops during the setting process, influenced by the microstructural characteristics. The presence of high void fractions indicates that the hardened gypsum is not a compact solid, which can impact its load-bearing capacity.\n\nIn summary, the microstructure of hardened gypsum is defined by its porous nature, the distribution of water within its structure, and the effects of various additives, all of which play a critical role in determining its mechanical properties and suitability for various applications.
