answer: >-
    The Pirpainti Thermal Power Project in Bihar is a significant initiative approved by the Bihar government, which involves the establishment of a 2,400 MW coal-fired thermal power plant located in the Bhagalpur district. Initially, the project was planned for a capacity of 1,320 MW but was shelved before being revived by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.\n\nKey details about the project include:\n\n1. **Capacity and Structure**: The project will consist of two units, each with a capacity of 660 MW, totaling 2,400 MW. The equity proportion for the project is set at 74% by NHPC (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) and 26% by BSPGCL (Bihar State Power Generation Company Limited).\n\n2. **Land Acquisition**: The total land required for the project is approximately 1,179.08 acres, out of which 1,001.405 acres have already been acquired.\n\n3. **Financial Investment**: The Union Budget 2024 has allocated â‚¹21,400 crore for the development of this power plant. This investment is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy, particularly benefiting industries related to highway construction and cement production due to increased demand.\n\n4. **Current Status**: As of now, the project is awaiting approval from the Union Coal Ministry, which is a necessary step before construction can commence.\n\n5. **Broader Context**: The announcement of the power plant is part of a larger development package for Bihar, which includes various infrastructure projects aimed at boosting the state's economic growth.\n\nThis project is anticipated to play a crucial role in enhancing the power supply in Bihar, contributing to the state's overall development and energy security.
