answer: >-
    To calculate the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\frac{1}{R_e} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n}\n$$\n\n### Example Calculation\n\nLet's consider an example where three resistors with the following values are connected in parallel:\n- $ R_1 = 4 \, \Omega $\n- $ R_2 = 6 \, \Omega $\n- $ R_3 = 8 \, \Omega $\n\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the equivalent resistance $ R_e $:\n\n1. Calculate the reciprocal of each resistor:\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667 $\n   - $ \frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 $\n\n2. Sum the reciprocals:\n   $$\n   \frac{1}{R_e} = 0.25 + 0.1667 + 0.125 = 0.5417\n   $$\n\n3. Take the reciprocal of the sum to find $ R_e $:\n   $$\n   R_e = \frac{1}{0.5417} \approx 1.846 \, \Omega\n   $$\n\nThus, the equivalent resistance of the three resistors connected in parallel is approximately $ 1.846 \, \Omega $. \n\nThis method can be applied to any number of resistors connected in parallel, and the equivalent resistance will always be less than the smallest individual resistor in the group.
