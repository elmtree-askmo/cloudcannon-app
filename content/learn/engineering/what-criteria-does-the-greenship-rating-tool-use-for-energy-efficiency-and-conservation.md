    What criteria does the GREENSHIP rating tool use for energy efficiency and conservation?
answer: >-
    The GREENSHIP rating tool, developed by the Green Building Council Indonesia (GBCI), evaluates the sustainability of buildings through a comprehensive set of criteria, particularly focusing on energy efficiency and conservation (EEC). Here are the key criteria used in the EEC category:\n\n1. **Prerequisite Criteria**:\n   - **Electrical Submetering**: This criterion requires the installation of submetering systems to monitor and manage electrical consumption effectively.\n   - **OTTV Calculation**: The Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) calculation assesses the thermal performance of the building envelope, ensuring that it meets specific energy efficiency standards.\n\n2. **Bonus Criteria**:\n   - **On-Site Renewable Energy**: This criterion encourages the integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy and enhance the building's sustainability profile.\n\n3. **Credit Criteria**:\n   - The EEC category includes four credit criteria, which collectively offer a maximum of 26 points. These criteria focus on various energy efficiency measures that can be implemented in the building design and operation. Specific measures may include:\n     - Energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems.\n     - Use of high-performance insulation materials.\n     - Implementation of energy management systems.\n\nThe emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation is crucial, as the building sector is responsible for a significant portion of global energy-related carbon emissions. By adhering to these criteria, buildings can achieve higher ratings within the GREENSHIP system, contributing to overall sustainability goals.\n\nIn summary, the GREENSHIP rating tool's criteria for energy efficiency and conservation are designed to promote effective energy management, reduce environmental impact, and encourage the use of renewable energy sources in building design and operation.
