    What is the difference between power absorbed and power delivered in resistors?
answer: >-
    The difference between power absorbed and power delivered in resistors is fundamentally tied to the principles of energy conservation in electrical circuits.\n\n1. **Power Delivered**: This refers to the total power supplied by the source (like a battery) to the circuit. It can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$ \n   P_{\text{delivered}} = V \cdot I \n   $$\n   where $ V $ is the voltage of the source and $ I $ is the total current flowing from the source.\n\n2. **Power Absorbed**: This is the power consumed by the resistors in the circuit. Each resistor absorbs power based on the current flowing through it and its resistance, calculated using:\n   $$ \n   P_{\text{absorbed}} = I^2 R \n   $$\n   or alternatively,\n   $$ \n   P_{\text{absorbed}} = \frac{V^2}{R} \n   $$\n   where $ R $ is the resistance of the resistor.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Energy Conservation**: According to the principle of energy conservation, the total power delivered by the source must equal the total power absorbed by all the resistors in the circuit. This can be expressed as:\n  $$\n  P_{\text{delivered}} = \sum P_{\text{absorbed}}\n  $$\n  This means that the power supplied by the battery is equal to the sum of the power consumed by each resistor.\n\n- **Kirchhoff’s Laws**: Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law supports this concept by stating that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero, ensuring that energy is conserved throughout the circuit.\n\nIn summary, power delivered is the total energy supplied by the source, while power absorbed is the energy consumed by the resistors. The two are equal in a closed circuit, reflecting the conservation of energy.
