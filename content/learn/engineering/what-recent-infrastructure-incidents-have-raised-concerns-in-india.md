    What recent infrastructure incidents have raised concerns in India?
answer: >-
    Recent infrastructure incidents in India have raised significant concerns, particularly regarding safety and the adequacy of urban planning. Notably, a roof collapse at New Delhi's main airport has highlighted the challenges faced by the government in its efforts to establish India as a global aviation hub. This incident raises questions about the rapid pace of infrastructure development and the potential risks associated with it.\n\nAdditionally, the country has experienced severe infrastructure challenges due to natural disasters. For instance, parts of Tamil Nadu faced a flood-like situation following incessant rainfall, which underscores the vulnerability of urban infrastructure to extreme weather events. Such incidents are indicative of the broader issues within India's urban infrastructure, which is at a critical juncture as the urban population is expected to double in the coming decades.\n\nMoreover, the India Infrastructure Report 2023 emphasizes the need for substantial investment in urban infrastructure, estimating that India will require $840 billion over the next 15 years to meet the demands of its growing urban population. This report highlights the legal, fiscal, regulatory, and technological challenges that need to be addressed to ensure sustainable urban development.\n\nOverall, these incidents and reports reflect the urgent need for improved infrastructure planning and management in India to prevent future accidents and to accommodate the rapid urbanization the country is experiencing.
