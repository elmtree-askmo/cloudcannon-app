    What does Kirchhoff's Voltage Law state about the sum of voltages in a closed loop?
answer: >-
    Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the sum of the electrical potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in a circuit must equal zero. This means that the total amount of voltage supplied by sources in the loop is equal to the total amount of voltage dropped across the components within that loop. \n\nIn mathematical terms, if you consider a closed loop in a circuit, the law can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\sum V = 0\n$$\n\nThis implies that if you traverse the loop and add up all the voltages (taking into account the polarity of each voltage), the result will be zero. This law is fundamental in circuit analysis as it helps in understanding how voltage is distributed in electrical circuits and is essential for applying techniques such as mesh analysis.\n\nIn summary, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law ensures that energy is conserved in electrical circuits, as all energy supplied by sources is consumed by the components in the loop.
