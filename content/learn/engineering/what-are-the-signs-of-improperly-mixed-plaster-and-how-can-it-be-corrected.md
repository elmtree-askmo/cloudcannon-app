answer: >-
    Improperly mixed plaster can exhibit several signs that indicate issues with its composition or application. Here are some common signs of improperly mixed plaster and how they can be corrected:\n\n### Signs of Improperly Mixed Plaster\n\n1. **Crumbling or Flaking**: If the plaster breaks down into fine sand upon touch, it indicates that there was an inadequate amount of cementing compound used in the mix. This can lead to deterioration over time.\n\n2. **Popping**: This occurs when particles within the plaster expand upon setting, creating conical holes known as "blows" or "pops" on the surface. \n\n3. **Uneven Surface**: An uneven plaster surface often results from poor workmanship during the application process, which can be exacerbated by improper mixing.\n\n4. **Cracking**: Larger, randomly spaced cracks can appear due to incorrect mix proportions, insufficient surface preparation, or excessive drying.\n\n5. **Efflorescence**: This is the formation of hard spots on the surface, which can indicate issues with the plaster mix or the presence of moisture.\n\n### Corrections for Improperly Mixed Plaster\n\n1. **Surface Cleaning**: Before applying plaster, ensure that the surface is free of dust, grease, and moisture. This helps improve adhesion and overall finish.\n\n2. **Adjusting the Mix**: For crumbling plaster, consider using better quality plaster sand or reducing the amount of cement in the mix. A proper mix ratio is crucial; typically, a 50/50 ratio of water to plaster is recommended, mixed until thick and smooth.\n\n3. **Repairing Popping**: To remedy popping, remove the affected area, fill the holes, and reapply plaster. Ensure that the mix is free of particles that could expand.\n\n4. **Addressing Uneven Surfaces**: If the surface is uneven, it may require reapplication. Ensure that the plaster is applied evenly and that the layers adhere properly.\n\n5. **Preventing Cracking**: To minimize cracking, use a less cement-rich mix and high-quality sand. Limit the plaster thickness to about 15mm per coat and ensure proper curing.\n\n6. **Moisture Management**: In humid areas, use moisture-resistant plaster mixes and paints to prevent degradation over time.\n\nBy addressing these signs and implementing corrective measures, the quality and durability of plaster applications can be significantly improved.
