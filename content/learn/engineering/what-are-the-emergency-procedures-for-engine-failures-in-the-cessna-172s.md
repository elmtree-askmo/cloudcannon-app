answer: >-
    In the event of an engine failure in the Cessna 172S, the emergency procedures are critical for ensuring the safety of the aircraft and its occupants. Here are the key steps to follow based on the gathered information:\n\n### Engine Failure During Flight\n1. **Airspeed**: Maintain a best glide speed of 68 KIAS.\n2. **Fuel Shutoff Valve**: Ensure the fuel shutoff valve is ON (push it fully in).\n3. **Fuel Selector Valve**: Set to BOTH.\n4. **Fuel Pump Switch**: Turn ON the fuel pump.\n5. **Mixture Control**: Set to RICH if the engine has not restarted.\n\n### Engine Failure Immediately After Takeoff\n1. **Throttle**: Pull to IDLE (full out).\n2. **Brakes**: Apply brakes to stop the aircraft.\n3. **Wing Flaps**: Retract flaps.\n4. **Mixture**: Set to Idle Cutoff (pull out).\n\n### Forced Landing\n- If a restart is not possible, prepare for a forced landing by selecting a suitable landing area and following the appropriate landing procedures.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- If the engine restarts during the glide, turn off the electric fuel pump and monitor fuel flow.\n- Always refer to the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) for complete procedures and checklists specific to the Cessna 172S.\n\nThese procedures are designed to maximize the chances of a safe outcome in the event of an engine failure. It is essential for pilots to be familiar with these steps and to practice them regularly in training scenarios.
