    What is the formula for calculating electrical power in a circuit, and what are its units?
answer: >-
    The formula for calculating electrical power in a circuit is given by:\n\n$$\nP = VI\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $ P $ is the power in Watts (W),\n- $ V $ is the voltage in Volts (V),\n- $ I $ is the current in Amperes (A).\n\nElectrical power can also be expressed in alternative forms derived from Ohm's law, which are:\n\n$$\nP = I^2R\n$$\n\nand \n\n$$\nP = \frac{V^2}{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $ R $ is the resistance in Ohms (Î©).\n\nThe unit of electrical power is the Watt (W), where one Watt is equivalent to one Joule per second. For example, if a device operates at 120 volts and draws 2 Amps of current, the power consumed by the device can be calculated as:\n\n$$\nP = 120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ Watts}\n$$\n\nThis illustrates how power is a measure of the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted in a circuit.
