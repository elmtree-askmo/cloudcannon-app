    What are the acoustic absorption and insulation properties of gypsum?
answer: >-
    Gypsum exhibits notable acoustic absorption and insulation properties, making it a valuable material in construction and architectural acoustics. \n\n1. **Acoustic Absorption**: Gypsum has a high capacity for sound absorption, which is influenced by its microstructure. Sound-absorbing gypsum typically features a porous microstructure with interconnected pores, contributing to high airflow resistivity, porosity, and tortuosity. The sound absorption properties of gypsum can be classified according to EN ISO 11654, with various configurations of gypsum boards evaluated across a frequency range from 125 Hz to 4,000 Hz. For instance, standard gypsum board (12 mm thick) has an absorption coefficient ranging from 0.04 to 0.07, indicating relatively low absorption compared to other materials like mineral wool, which has a much higher absorption coefficient of 0.65.\n\n2. **Acoustic Insulation**: While gypsum is commonly used in construction, recent research suggests that gypsum wallboard may have less sound absorption than previously assumed when used in certain assemblies. However, gypsum blocks, which are lightweight and easy to install, provide excellent sound insulation properties, making them suitable for constructing load-bearing walls in interior spaces.\n\n3. **Thermal Insulation**: In addition to its acoustic properties, gypsum also offers good thermal insulation, helping to regulate temperature and reduce heat transfer. Gypsum-based products, such as plasterboard and insulation boards, are often used in interior wall and ceiling applications to enhance energy efficiency in buildings.\n\nOverall, gypsum's combination of acoustic absorption, insulation properties, and thermal performance makes it a versatile material in the construction industry, contributing to improved energy efficiency and comfort in buildings.
