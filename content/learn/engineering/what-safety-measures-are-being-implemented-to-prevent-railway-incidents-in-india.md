    What safety measures are being implemented to prevent railway incidents in India?
answer: >-
    In recent years, Indian Railways has implemented a comprehensive set of safety measures aimed at preventing railway incidents and enhancing the overall safety of train operations. Here are some key initiatives and strategies that have been adopted:\n\n1. **Railway Safety Act 2023**: This legislative framework is designed to enhance the safety and security of railway operations in India. It addresses various safety concerns, streamlines safety protocols, and aims to improve overall safety standards.\n\n2. **Interlocking Systems**: As of October 2023, Indian Railways has installed electrical/electronic interlocking systems with centralized operation of points and signals at 6,498 stations. This technology helps in preventing accidents by ensuring that signals and track switches are correctly set before a train can proceed.\n\n3. **Level Crossing Safety**: Interlocking of level crossing gates has been implemented at 11,093 level crossing gates to enhance safety. Additionally, several level crossing gates have been closed to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n4. **Technological Upgrades**: Indian Railways has adopted various technologies to prevent accidents, including:\n   - **Kavach System**: A train collision avoidance system that has undergone multiple upgrades, with version 4.0 approved in July 2024.\n   - **Fog Pass Devices**: These portable devices are provided to locomotive pilots operating in fog-prone areas to enhance visibility and safety during adverse weather conditions.\n   - **Modern Signaling Systems**: The modernization of signaling systems includes the implementation of automatic signaling and electronic interlocking, which improve the safety and efficiency of train operations.\n\n5. **Accident Prevention Projects**: Initiatives like the "Connecting Safety on the Railway Tracks" project focus on employing innovative technologies and strategic interventions to mitigate the risk of accidents.\n\n6. **Safety Expenditure**: The expenditure on safety-related activities has significantly increased, reflecting the priority given to safety in train operations. This investment has contributed to a notable reduction in consequential train accidents, from 135 in 2014-15 to 40 in 2023-24.\n\n7. **Recruitment and Training**: Indian Railways has prioritized the recruitment of personnel dedicated to safety, with over 488,724 recruits from April 2014 to June 2023, ensuring that there are enough trained staff to maintain safety standards.\n\n8. **Cybersecurity Measures**: Recognizing the importance of cybersecurity in railway operations, a dedicated Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence has been established to address potential threats and enhance the safety of digital systems.\n\nThese measures collectively reflect Indian Railways' commitment to improving safety standards and reducing the incidence of railway accidents, thereby ensuring safer travel for passengers.
