    What safety considerations are important when working with electric power?
answer: >-
    When working with electric power, safety considerations are paramount to prevent accidents and injuries. Here are some essential safety precautions to keep in mind:\n\n1. **De-energize Circuits**: Always de-energize electrical circuits before performing any work. This is crucial to prevent accidental electrocution.\n\n2. **Use Lockout Devices**: Implement lockout/tagout procedures to ensure that circuits cannot be re-energized while work is being performed. This adds an extra layer of safety.\n\n3. **Verify Power is Off**: Use an AC voltage tester to confirm that the electrical power is indeed off before starting any work. This step is vital to ensure that no live current is present.\n\n4. **Insulated Tools and PPE**: When working with live electricity, use insulated tools and personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize the risk of electrical shock.\n\n5. **Keep Equipment Dry**: Maintain a safe distance between electrical equipment and water. It is recommended to keep liquids at least 5 feet away from electrical sources to prevent accidental contact.\n\n6. **Avoid Wet Hands**: Never handle electrical equipment with wet hands or while standing on wet surfaces, as this significantly increases the risk of electric shock.\n\n7. **Use Non-conductive Ladders**: When working near power lines or electrical installations, use ladders made of non-conductive materials, such as fiberglass, to prevent electrical conduction.\n\n8. **Conduct Regular Training**: Regular electrical safety training sessions should be conducted to ensure that all personnel are aware of the risks and safety practices associated with working with electricity.\n\n9. **Perform Safety Assessments**: Conduct electrical safety assessments to identify potential hazards and implement preventive measures. This proactive approach can help mitigate risks.\n\n10. **Stay Informed About Hazards**: Be aware of the specific electrical hazards present in your workplace and follow established safety protocols tailored to those risks.\n\nBy adhering to these safety considerations, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of electrical accidents and ensure a safer working environment when dealing with electric power.
