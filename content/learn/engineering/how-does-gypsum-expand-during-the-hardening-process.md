    How does gypsum expand during the hardening process?
answer: >-
    During the hardening process of gypsum, which is primarily composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate ($CaSO_4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}H_2O$), a hydration reaction occurs that transforms it into calcium sulfate dihydrate ($CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O$). This process is characterized by a slight bulk expansion. \n\nWhen powdered plaster is mixed with water, the reverse reaction takes place rapidly, leading to the formation of a hardened mass of gypsum. The hydration process generates heat, which contributes to the volume increase or expansion. This expansion is typically slight, but it can be significantly enhanced by the addition of certain additives, such as calcium acetate, which can lead to a more pronounced volume increase.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of sodium sulfate or gypsum can provide sulfate ions that promote the formation of ettringite, a compound that compensates for volume shrinkage during hardening. The overall structure of the hardened gypsum undergoes continuous changes, with the formation of various hydrate phases that exhibit different crystalline structures, such as needles, fibers, prisms, and plates. This structural transformation introduces a degree of instability and disorder, which can also contribute to the expansion observed during the hardening process.\n\nIn summary, gypsum expands during hardening primarily due to the hydration reaction that converts hemihydrate to dihydrate, along with the influence of additives that can enhance this expansion.
