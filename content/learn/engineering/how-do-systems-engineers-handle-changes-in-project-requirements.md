answer: >-
    Systems engineers handle changes in project requirements through a structured process known as Requirements Change Management. This process is essential for maintaining project integrity and ensuring that stakeholder expectations are met as systems evolve and new needs arise. Here are the key aspects of how systems engineers manage changes in project requirements:\n\n1. **Identification of Change Needs**: The first step in the change management process is to identify the need for a change. This could arise from stakeholder feedback, technological advancements, or shifts in project scope.\n\n2. **Analysis of Changes**: Once a change is identified, systems engineers analyze its implications. This involves assessing how the change will affect the overall project, including its schedule, costs, and quality of deliverables.\n\n3. **Documentation**: A critical component of change management is thorough documentation. All changes must be recorded systematically to ensure traceability and to maintain a clear history of modifications. This documentation helps in understanding the rationale behind changes and their impacts.\n\n4. **Approval Process**: Changes must go through an approval process where stakeholders review and agree on the proposed modifications. This step is crucial to ensure that all parties are aligned and that the changes are justified.\n\n5. **Implementation**: After approval, the changes are implemented. This may involve updating design documents, modifying system components, or adjusting project plans.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: Post-implementation, the effects of the changes are evaluated to ensure that they have been successfully integrated into the project and that they meet the intended goals.\n\n7. **Managing Requirements Volatility**: Systems engineers must also be aware of requirements volatility, which can increase the functional size of the project and lead to rework. The impact of changes tends to grow as the project progresses through its life cycle, making early identification and management of changes critical.\n\n8. **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**: The adoption of MBSE practices can enhance change management processes by providing tools and frameworks that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managing changes.\n\nBy following these structured steps, systems engineers can minimize the negative impacts of changes on project schedules and costs, while ensuring that the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and expectations. Effective management of requirements and artifacts is vital for navigating the complexities of modern engineering projects.
