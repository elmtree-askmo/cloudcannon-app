    How are principal planes or normal planes defined in the context of orthographic projections?
answer: >-
    In the context of orthographic projections, principal planes or normal planes are defined as the three primary planes used to create different views of a three-dimensional object. These planes are:\n\n1. **Frontal Plane**: This plane is used to depict the front and rear details of the object. It is oriented such that it provides a view of the object from the front.\n\n2. **Horizontal Plane**: This plane allows for the representation of the top and bottom details of the object. It is positioned horizontally relative to the object.\n\n3. **Profile Plane**: This plane is used to show the side details of the object, either from the left or right side.\n\nA **normal surface** is defined as a surface that is perpendicular to two of the principal planes and parallel to the third. This concept is crucial in orthographic projection as it helps in accurately representing the dimensions and relationships of the object being depicted. \n\nIn orthographic projection, the principal planes are aligned with the projection plane, allowing for clear and accurate representations of the object's dimensions without distortion. If the principal planes or axes of an object are not parallel to the projection plane, the resulting depiction is referred to as axonometric or auxiliary views, which can complicate the visualization of the object's true dimensions.\n\nOverall, the use of these principal planes in orthographic projection is essential for creating accurate and detailed engineering drawings, which communicate three-dimensional information in a two-dimensional format.
