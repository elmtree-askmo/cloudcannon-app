    How are V_IL, V_IH, and V_th estimated for CMOS inverters?
answer: >-
    In estimating the input voltage levels for a CMOS inverter, specifically the values of $V_{IL}$ (input low voltage), $V_{IH}$ (input high voltage), and $V_{th}$ (threshold voltage), several key relationships and characteristics are considered.\n\n1. **Threshold Voltage ($V_{th}$)**: For a symmetric CMOS inverter, the threshold voltage is typically defined as:\n   $$\n   V_{th} = \frac{V_{DD}}{2}\n   $$\n   This means that the inverter switches from a low output to a high output when the input voltage reaches half of the supply voltage ($V_{DD}$).\n\n2. **Input Low Voltage ($V_{IL}$)**: This is the maximum input voltage at which the output is guaranteed to be low (logic '0'). It can be estimated based on the characteristics of the NMOS transistor in the inverter. For a symmetric inverter, it is often approximated as:\n   $$\n   V_{IL} \approx V_{th} - V_{T0n}\n   $$\n   where $V_{T0n}$ is the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistor.\n\n3. **Input High Voltage ($V_{IH}$)**: This is the minimum input voltage at which the output is guaranteed to be high (logic '1'). It can be estimated similarly, considering the PMOS transistor:\n   $$\n   V_{IH} \approx V_{th} + V_{T0p}\n   $$\n   where $V_{T0p}$ is the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor.\n\n4. **Noise Margins**: The noise margins can also be derived from these values. The noise margin for low ($NM_L$) and high ($NM_H$) states can be calculated as:\n   - $NM_L = V_{IL} - V_{OL}$\n   - $NM_H = V_{OH} - V_{IH}$\n   where $V_{OL}$ and $V_{OH}$ are the output low and high voltages, respectively.\n\n5. **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)**: The VTC of the CMOS inverter is a crucial aspect that illustrates how the output voltage changes with varying input voltage. The transition region, where the output switches from low to high, is particularly important for determining $V_{IL}$ and $V_{IH}$.\n\nIn summary, $V_{IL}$, $V_{IH}$, and $V_{th}$ can be estimated using the relationships between the threshold voltages of the NMOS and PMOS transistors, along with the supply voltage $V_{DD}$. These parameters are essential for understanding the performance and reliability of CMOS inverters in digital circuits.
