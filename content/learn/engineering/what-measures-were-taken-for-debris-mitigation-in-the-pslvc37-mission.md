    What measures were taken for debris mitigation in the PSLV-C37 mission?
answer: >-
    The PSLV-C37 mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on February 15, 2017, made significant strides in debris mitigation. The mission was notable for deploying a record 104 satellites in a single launch, and it has been recognized for its commitment to responsible space practices.\n\nOne of the key measures taken for debris mitigation in the PSLV-C37 mission was the planned re-entry of the upper stage of the rocket. This upper stage successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on October 6, 2024, which was fully compliant with international debris mitigation guidelines, particularly those set by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). The re-entry occurred within eight years of the launch, aligning with global efforts to minimize space debris.\n\nISRO has implemented a comprehensive debris mitigation strategy that includes monitoring space debris and ensuring compliance with established guidelines. The agency is also working towards reducing the post-mission orbital lifetime of PSLV upper stages to less than five years, with plans for controlled re-entries in future missions. This initiative is part of ISRO's broader goal to achieve "Debris Free Space Missions" (DFSM) by 2030, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices in space operations.\n\nOverall, the PSLV-C37 mission exemplifies ISRO's proactive approach to managing space debris and its commitment to maintaining a cleaner space environment for future missions.
