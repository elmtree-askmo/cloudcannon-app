    What are the key differences between series and parallel circuits in terms of current pathways?
answer: >-
    The key differences between series and parallel circuits in terms of current pathways are as follows:\n\n### Series Circuits\n1. **Single Path for Current Flow**: In a series circuit, all components are connected end-to-end, creating a single pathway for the current to flow. This means that the same current flows through each component in the circuit.\n\n2. **Current Characteristics**: Since there is only one path, the current remains constant throughout the entire circuit. If one component fails (e.g., a resistor burns out), the entire circuit is interrupted, and current stops flowing.\n\n3. **Voltage Distribution**: The total voltage supplied by the power source is divided among the components. The voltage drop across each component can be calculated using Ohm's Law ($V = IR$), where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance of the component.\n\n### Parallel Circuits\n1. **Multiple Paths for Current Flow**: In a parallel circuit, components are connected across the same two points, providing multiple pathways for current to flow. This configuration allows the current to split among the different branches.\n\n2. **Current Characteristics**: The total current flowing from the power source is the sum of the currents through each branch. If one branch fails, current can still flow through the other branches, allowing the circuit to remain operational.\n\n3. **Voltage Consistency**: The voltage across each component in a parallel circuit is the same and equal to the voltage of the power source. This means that each component experiences the same voltage, while the current through each component can vary depending on its resistance.\n\n### Summary\n- **Series Circuit**: Single pathway, constant current, voltage divided among components.\n- **Parallel Circuit**: Multiple pathways, current divided among branches, constant voltage across components.\n\nThese differences significantly affect how electrical circuits are designed and how they function in practical applications.
