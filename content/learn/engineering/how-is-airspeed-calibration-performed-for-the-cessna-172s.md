    How is airspeed calibration performed for the Cessna 172S?
answer: >-
    Airspeed calibration for the Cessna 172S involves ensuring that the airspeed indicator accurately reflects the aircraft's true airspeed under various conditions. The calibration process typically includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Static Source Calibration**: The airspeed indicator is connected to the Pitot-static system, which measures the difference between dynamic pressure (from the Pitot tube) and static pressure (from the static port). Calibration is performed under normal static source conditions, where the aircraft is flown at various speeds to establish a baseline for accurate readings.\n\n2. **Power-Off Airspeed Calibration**: This calibration is often conducted during power-off maneuvers. The aircraft is flown at different airspeeds, and the readings from the airspeed indicator are compared to the actual airspeed to identify any discrepancies.\n\n3. **Use of Alternate Static Source**: If the alternate static source is utilized, it is important to refer to the specific airspeed calibration variations between the normal and alternate static sources. The Cessna 172S manual provides an Alternate Static Source Airspeed Calibration table that outlines these variations, which can include a maximum airspeed and altimeter variation of 4 knots and 30 feet, respectively, when the windows are closed.\n\n4. **Adjustment for Temperature**: The airspeed indicator may also have a True Airspeed (TAS) adjustment feature, which allows pilots to align the pressure altitude with outside air temperature (OAT) to read TAS accurately.\n\n5. **Documentation and Reference**: Pilots should refer to the Cessna 172S performance manual for detailed tables and figures that provide the necessary calibration data for different configurations, such as flap settings and weight conditions.\n\nBy following these procedures, pilots can ensure that the airspeed readings are accurate, which is crucial for safe flight operations.
