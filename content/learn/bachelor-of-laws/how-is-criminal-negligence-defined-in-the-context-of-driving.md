    How is criminal negligence defined in the context of driving?
answer: >-
    Criminal negligence in the context of driving is defined as a failure to exercise reasonable care that results in harm or injury to another person. It is characterized by a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in similar circumstances. This legal concept implies that the driver's actions create a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm.\n\nFor instance, a driver who is texting while driving and subsequently causes a fatal accident may be charged with criminal negligence. Similarly, a driver who recklessly speeds through a crowded area, leading to injuries, could also face charges of criminal negligence. In both cases, the actions of the driver demonstrate a significant disregard for the safety of others, which is a key element in establishing criminal negligence.\n\nIn summary, criminal negligence in driving involves actions that not only fail to meet the expected standard of care but also pose a serious risk to the safety of others, potentially leading to severe consequences such as injury or death.
