    Define investigative detention and its legal standards.
answer: >-
    Investigative detention is a legal concept that refers to the temporary detention of an individual by law enforcement officers for the purpose of investigating a potential crime. This type of detention is distinct from an arrest in that it does not require a warrant and is based on a lower standard of proof known as "reasonable suspicion."\n\n### Legal Standards for Investigative Detention\n\n1. **Reasonable Suspicion**: The primary legal standard for investigative detention is that law enforcement must have reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in criminal activity. This suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts, rather than a mere hunch or unparticular intuition. For example, if a police officer observes someone behaving suspiciously near a crime scene, this may constitute reasonable suspicion.\n\n2. **Duration and Scope**: Investigative detentions are intended to be brief and limited in scope. The duration should be no longer than necessary to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicion. Officers are allowed to ask questions and may conduct a limited pat-down for weapons if they have reason to believe the individual may be armed.\n\n3. **No Arrest**: It is important to note that investigative detention is not the same as an arrest. An arrest typically requires probable cause, which is a higher standard than reasonable suspicion. During an investigative detention, the individual is not formally charged with a crime and is free to leave once the officer has completed their inquiries, provided that the officer does not have probable cause to make an arrest.\n\n4. **Legal Protections**: Individuals subjected to investigative detention retain certain rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal representation. Law enforcement must also respect the individual's privacy rights during the detention.\n\n5. **Judicial Oversight**: While investigative detentions do not require a warrant, they are subject to judicial review. If a detention is challenged in court, the judge will assess whether the officer had reasonable suspicion at the time of the detention and whether the detention was conducted in a lawful manner.\n\nIn summary, investigative detention is a critical tool for law enforcement that allows for the temporary detention of individuals based on reasonable suspicion, enabling officers to investigate potential criminal activity while balancing the rights of individuals.
