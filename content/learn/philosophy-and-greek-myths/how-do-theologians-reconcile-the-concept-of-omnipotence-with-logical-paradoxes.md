    How do theologians reconcile the concept of omnipotence with logical paradoxes?
answer: >-
    The reconciliation of divine omnipotence with logical paradoxes is a significant topic in theological and philosophical discourse. The most notable paradox is the "stone paradox," which poses the question: Can God create a stone so heavy that He cannot lift it? This paradox is intended to challenge the coherence of the concept of omnipotence by suggesting that if God can create such a stone, then there is something He cannot do (lift it), and if He cannot create it, then there is also something He cannot do (create it).\n\nTheologians, particularly those influenced by the work of Thomas Aquinas, argue that omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are logically possible. Aquinas posits that anything that implies a contradiction is not included in the realm of divine omnipotence. For instance, he states that "whatever implies contradiction is not included under divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the nature of possibility." This perspective allows theologians to assert that God's omnipotence does not extend to performing logically contradictory actions, such as creating a stone so heavy that He cannot lift it.\n\nFurthermore, rational theology seeks to analyze the concept of omnipotence in a way that resolves these paradoxes. It emphasizes that if the notion of omnipotence were found to be unintelligible or incompatible with moral perfection, it would undermine traditional Western theism. Thus, theologians maintain that divine omnipotence is compatible with other divine attributes, such as moral perfection and immutability, which further shapes the understanding of God's nature.\n\nIn summary, theologians reconcile the concept of omnipotence with logical paradoxes by framing omnipotence within logical constraints, asserting that it encompasses only those actions that do not entail contradictions. This approach allows for a coherent understanding of divine power that aligns with traditional theological beliefs.
