answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien was a significant and transformative relationship that profoundly impacted Lewis's spiritual perspective and literary output. Their bond began in 1926 when they met at a reading group founded by Tolkien called the "Coalbiters." This group fostered a shared love for mythology, storytelling, and the marvelous, which became a cornerstone of their friendship.\n\nBoth authors were members of the Inklings, a literary group that met regularly to discuss their works and ideas. This environment of intellectual exchange allowed them to influence each other's writing and beliefs. For instance, Lewis dedicated his book *The Screwtape Letters* to Tolkien, while Tolkien dedicated *The Lord of the Rings* to the Inklings, highlighting the mutual respect and admiration they had for one another.\n\nTolkien played a crucial role in Lewis's return to Christianity. Their discussions often revolved around Christian theology, and Tolkien's insights helped Lewis reconnect with the faith of his youth. In turn, Lewis encouraged Tolkien to pursue his writing, particularly in bringing his expansive fantasy world to life. This reciprocal encouragement was vital for both authors, as it spurred them to create some of the most beloved literary works of the 20th century.\n\nDespite their close friendship, they also experienced disagreements, particularly regarding theological matters. These debates, however, did not diminish their bond; rather, they enriched it, allowing both men to explore and articulate their beliefs more deeply. Lewis later reflected on the importance of their friendship in his book *The Four Loves*, where he honored the profound impact that Tolkien and their shared experiences had on his life.\n\nIn summary, the friendship between C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien was characterized by mutual inspiration, intellectual engagement, and spiritual growth, leaving a lasting legacy on both their works and the broader landscape of literature and faith.
