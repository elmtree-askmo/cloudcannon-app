    What is Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures?
answer: >-
    John Stuart Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures is a fundamental aspect of his utilitarian philosophy, which he elaborates in his work *Utilitarianism*. Mill argues that not all pleasures are of equal value; rather, they can be categorized into two types: higher pleasures and lower pleasures.\n\nHigher pleasures are primarily associated with intellectual and moral faculties, often described as 'mental' pleasures. These include activities such as engaging in philosophical thought, appreciating art, or experiencing deep emotional connections. Mill posits that these pleasures are inherently more valuable than lower pleasures, which are linked to physical sensations and immediate gratification, such as eating, drinking, or other bodily pleasures.\n\nTo support his distinction, Mill introduces the concept of "competent judges." These are individuals who have experienced both higher and lower pleasures and are therefore best equipped to determine which type of pleasure is superior. Mill asserts that competent judges will consistently prefer higher pleasures over lower ones, even if the latter may provide more immediate satisfaction.\n\nThis qualitative distinction marks a significant departure from the earlier utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, who focused primarily on the quantity of pleasure and pain without considering their quality. Mill's approach emphasizes that the quality of pleasures should be taken into account when making moral decisions, suggesting that higher pleasures contribute more significantly to human flourishing and well-being.\n\nIn summary, Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures is a critical element of his utilitarian framework, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of happiness that values intellectual and moral fulfillment over mere physical satisfaction.
