    What challenge did suitors face when seeking Hippodamia's hand, and what was the outcome for those who failed?
answer: >-
    The challenge that suitors faced when seeking Hippodamia's hand was a deadly chariot race set by her father, Oenomaus, the king of Pisa. Oenomaus, fearing a prophecy that he would be killed by the man who married his daughter, devised this lethal contest as a means to prevent any suitor from winning Hippodamia. \n\nIn this challenge, each suitor was required to take Hippodamia in his chariot and race to the Isthmus of Corinth. Oenomaus would pursue them in full armor, and if he overtook a suitor, he would kill him. This brutal method resulted in the deaths of many suitors—some accounts suggest as many as twelve—whose heads Oenomaus would then display by nailing them to his house as a grim trophy.\n\nThe outcome for those who failed in this challenge was death at the hands of Oenomaus, highlighting the themes of competition, divine retribution, and the lengths to which one might go to protect family interests in Greek mythology. Ultimately, it was Pelops, with the assistance of Myrtilus, who managed to win the race and Hippodamia's hand, leading to Oenomaus's demise and the beginning of Pelops's reign.
