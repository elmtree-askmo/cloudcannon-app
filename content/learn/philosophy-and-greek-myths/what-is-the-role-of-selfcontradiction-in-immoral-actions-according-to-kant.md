    What is the role of self-contradiction in immoral actions according to Kant?
answer: >-
    According to Immanuel Kant, self-contradiction plays a crucial role in determining the morality of actions through the lens of his Categorical Imperative, particularly in the context of maxims. Kant argues that a maxim is impermissible if willing it as a universal law leads to a self-contradiction of the will, which he refers to as a "volitional self-contradiction." This means that if one cannot will a maxim as a universal law without contradicting oneself, then that maxim is deemed immoral.\n\nFor example, consider the maxim of borrowing money with the intention of falsely promising to repay it. If one were to will this maxim as a universal law, it would lead to a contradiction because the very act of making a promise would lose its meaning if everyone acted on the same maxim. Thus, the act of borrowing under false pretenses cannot be willed universally without resulting in a self-contradiction.\n\nKant's approach emphasizes that immoral actions often involve a failure to recognize this self-contradiction. While some maxims may appear harmless or even morally positive, they can still fail the contradiction test if they cannot be universalized without leading to a logical inconsistency. For instance, the maxim of pursuing self-interest in a profession like law or medicine may not seem immoral at first glance, but if it leads to actions that cannot be universally accepted, it would still be considered impermissible.\n\nIn summary, for Kant, the role of self-contradiction in immoral actions is foundational to his moral philosophy. It serves as a litmus test for the permissibility of maxims, ensuring that moral duties are grounded in rationality and the capacity to will actions as universal laws without contradiction.
