    Describe the lifestyle and structure of Pythagorean communities.
answer: >-
    The Pythagorean community, established by the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras in Croton, Italy, was a unique blend of mathematics, philosophy, and mysticism. This community functioned much like a religious order or monastery, where members lived together, shared resources, and engaged in collective study and inquiry.\n\n### Lifestyle and Structure\n\n1. **Communal Living**: Members of the Pythagorean community lived in a communal setting, emphasizing shared knowledge and collective living. This lifestyle fostered a strong sense of unity and purpose among the members.\n\n2. **Focus on Study**: The community was dedicated to the study of mathematics, philosophy, and the mystical properties of numbers. Members engaged in rigorous intellectual pursuits, exploring concepts such as the Pythagorean theorem, which relates to the sides of right-angled triangles, and the mystical significance of numbers.\n\n3. **Philosophical Beliefs**: Central to Pythagorean beliefs was the idea of reincarnation, or the transmigration of souls. They believed that the soul is immortal and undergoes a cycle of rebirths, which influenced their ethical and philosophical outlook on life.\n\n4. **Factions within the Community**: After Pythagoras's death, the community experienced a division into two main factions:\n   - **Akusmaticoi**: This group focused on the mystical and religious aspects of Pythagorean teachings, emphasizing the spiritual significance of numbers and the metaphysical implications of their beliefs.\n   - **Mathematikoi**: This faction was more concerned with mathematical and scientific inquiry, prioritizing empirical study and the pursuit of knowledge through rational means.\n\n5. **Conflict and Discovery**: The community faced internal conflicts, particularly highlighted by the story of Hippasus, a member who discovered irrational numbers. This discovery contradicted the Pythagorean belief that all numbers could be expressed as ratios of whole numbers, leading to significant tension within the community.\n\n6. **Symbolism and Rituals**: The Pythagoreans employed various symbols, such as the tetractys, a triangular figure composed of ten points, which held deep philosophical and mystical significance. They believed that numbers had inherent properties that could explain the universe, and they often engaged in rituals that reflected their beliefs about the harmony of the cosmos.\n\n7. **Influence of Music**: The Pythagorean community also explored the relationship between music and mathematics, discovering that musical harmony could be expressed through mathematical ratios. This connection between music and numbers was a significant aspect of their philosophical framework.\n\n8. **Cultural and Religious Connections**: The Pythagorean community maintained connections with religious institutions and oracles, such as the Oracle of Delphi, which influenced their beliefs and practices.\n\nIn summary, the Pythagorean community was characterized by its communal lifestyle, a strong emphasis on mathematics and philosophy, and a belief in the mystical properties of numbers. The internal divisions and conflicts, particularly regarding the nature of numbers and the soul, reflect the dynamic intellectual environment of this ancient mathematical community.
