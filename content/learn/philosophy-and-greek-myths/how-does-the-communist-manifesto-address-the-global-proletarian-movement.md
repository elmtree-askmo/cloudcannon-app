    How does the Communist Manifesto address the global proletarian movement?
answer: >-
    The Communist Manifesto addresses the global proletarian movement by emphasizing the importance of international unity among the working class. Written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848, the Manifesto serves as a call to action for workers around the world to recognize their shared struggles against capitalism and to unite in their fight for liberation.\n\nOne of the key phrases from the Manifesto is "Workers of the World, Unite!" which encapsulates the idea that the proletariat, as the lowest stratum of society, cannot achieve true emancipation without solidarity across national boundaries. The text argues that the proletarian movement is a self-conscious and independent movement representing the interests of the immense majority. It highlights that the struggles of workers in one country are interconnected with those in others, and that only through collective action can they hope to overcome the oppressive structures of capitalism.\n\nThe Manifesto also critiques the policies of capitalist governments that seek to divide workers by fostering competition and nationalism, warning that such tactics threaten the unity necessary for revolutionary change. Marx and Engels believed that the international working-class unity was crucial for dismantling the capitalist system and achieving a classless society.\n\nFurthermore, the Communist League, which published the Manifesto, was initially a German organization but quickly evolved into an international movement, reflecting the global aspirations of the proletarian struggle. The text's emphasis on internationalism has had a lasting impact, inspiring various socialist and communist movements worldwide and contributing to significant revolutions, such as the Russian Revolution in 1917.\n\nIn summary, the Communist Manifesto articulates a vision of a united global proletariat, advocating for solidarity and collective action as essential components in the fight against capitalism and for the establishment of a communist society.
