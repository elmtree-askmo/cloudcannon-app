    What is the intuition of free will, and how does it relate to the laws of nature and the thesis of determinism?
answer: >-
    The intuition of free will is fundamentally the belief that individuals possess the ability to make choices that are not predetermined by prior events or natural laws. This intuition suggests that in any given situation, a person could have acted differently, implying a sense of agency and control over one's actions. For example, when faced with a decision, such as selecting a university, the common belief is that one has the freedom to choose among various options based on personal preferences and desires.\n\nIn contrast, determinism posits that all events, including human actions, are determined by preceding events and the laws of nature. This philosophical thesis asserts that given the state of the universe at a specific time, only one future is possible. In other words, if we had complete knowledge of all past events and the laws governing them, we could predict with certainty what will happen next. This deterministic view challenges the intuition of free will by suggesting that our choices are merely the result of a chain of prior causes, leaving no room for genuine freedom.\n\nThe relationship between free will and determinism is a central theme in philosophical discussions. The conflict arises because if determinism is true, it seems to undermine the very notion of free will. If every action is predetermined, then the idea that we could have chosen differently becomes problematic. This leads to various philosophical positions, such as incompatibilism, which holds that free will and determinism cannot coexist. If determinism is accurate, then free will must be rejected.\n\nOn the other hand, compatibilism attempts to reconcile these two views. Classical compatibilism, associated with philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and David Hume, suggests that an action can be considered free if it aligns with one's desires and is not constrained by external forces. New compatibilism, introduced by Harry Frankfurt, emphasizes the importance of having the will one wants to have, suggesting that true freedom involves a deeper understanding of one's desires and motivations.\n\nIn summary, the intuition of free will asserts that individuals can make choices independent of prior causes, while determinism argues that all events are the result of preceding events and natural laws, leading to only one possible future. The interplay between these concepts raises significant philosophical questions about moral responsibility, agency, and the nature of human decision-making.
