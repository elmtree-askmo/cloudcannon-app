    What is indirect realism and how does it differ from direct realism?
answer: >-
    Indirect realism and direct realism are two contrasting philosophical positions regarding the nature of perception and how we experience the world around us.\n\n**Direct Realism** (also known as naÃ¯ve realism) posits that we perceive the world directly as it exists. According to this view, objects are as they appear to us, and our perceptions are entirely accurate reflections of the external world. Direct realism asserts that the immediate objects of perception are mind-independent, meaning that physical objects exist independently of our minds and perceptions. This perspective aligns with common sense, suggesting that what we see, hear, and feel corresponds directly to the actual properties of the objects in the environment.\n\n**Indirect Realism**, on the other hand, was notably developed by philosopher John Locke and is also referred to as representationalism or epistemological dualism. This view argues that we do not perceive the world directly; instead, we perceive it through representations or ideas in our minds. Indirect realism suggests that the immediate objects of perception are not the external objects themselves but rather sense data or mental representations that are caused by those objects. This means that our perceptions are mediated by a "veil of perception," which can lead to perceptual phenomena such as illusions or hallucinations that direct realism cannot adequately explain.\n\nOne of the strengths of indirect realism is its ability to account for perceptual anomalies, such as the experience of phantom limbs, where individuals perceive sensations in a limb that is no longer physically present. In contrast, direct realism struggles to explain such phenomena, as it maintains that perceptions are direct reflections of reality.\n\nHowever, indirect realism faces criticism, particularly regarding the problem of perceptual skepticism. If we only perceive representations of reality, it raises questions about the existence of an external world independent of our perceptions. This skepticism is less pronounced in direct realism, which asserts a more straightforward relationship between perception and reality.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between the two theories lies in their understanding of perception: direct realism claims that we perceive objects directly as they exist, while indirect realism posits that our perceptions are mediated by mental representations, leading to a more complex relationship with the external world.
