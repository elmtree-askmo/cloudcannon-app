    What were C.S. Lewis's views on God's intentions during his crisis of faith?
answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's views on God's intentions during his crisis of faith were deeply intertwined with his intellectual journey from atheism to Christianity. Initially, Lewis was a determined atheist who struggled with the existence of evil and suffering in the world. However, he eventually came to see these very issues as arguments not only against atheism but also as compelling reasons to believe in God and Christianity.\n\nDuring his crisis of faith, Lewis grappled with the idea that if God exists, then why does suffering exist? He recognized that the presence of evil could be interpreted as a challenge to the notion of a benevolent deity. Yet, through his exploration of various worldviews and philosophical arguments, he began to understand that the existence of suffering could also point to a greater truth about the human condition and the need for redemption.\n\nLewis's conversion to theism in 1929 marked a significant turning point. He acknowledged that he could not dismiss the rational evidence for Christianity, which he later articulated in works such as "Mere Christianity." He believed that faith could coexist with reason, and that one could hold onto faith even amidst doubt and existential suffering. He famously stated, “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world,” suggesting that human longing points to a divine purpose.\n\nUltimately, Lewis's journey led him to view God's intentions as fundamentally rooted in love and the desire for a relationship with humanity. He described his conversion experience as one of reluctance, famously referring to himself as "the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England." This reflects his internal struggle and the profound impact of his intellectual and spiritual awakening, which he believed was guided by God's hand through various influences, including friendships and literature.\n\nIn summary, C.S. Lewis's views on God's intentions during his crisis of faith evolved from skepticism to a recognition of a loving God who uses suffering and longing to draw individuals toward Him, ultimately leading to his embrace of Christianity.
