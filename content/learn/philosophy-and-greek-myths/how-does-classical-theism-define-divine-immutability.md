    How does classical theism define divine immutability?
answer: >-
    In classical theism, divine immutability is defined as the doctrine that God cannot undergo real or intrinsic change in any respect. This means that God's essence, attributes, and purposes remain constant and unchanging. The concept is rooted in the belief that God is the infinitely perfect being, and any change would imply a deficiency or imperfection, which contradicts the nature of a perfect being.\n\nThe doctrine of divine immutability (DDI) asserts that while God may have extrinsic changes—such as changes in His knowledge of contingent events due to the passage of time—these do not affect His intrinsic nature. For instance, God’s knowledge may appear to change as time progresses, but this is understood as a change in the state of affairs rather than a change in God Himself. Thus, the sheer passage of time accounts for changes in God's contingent knowledge without implying that God is intrinsically mutable.\n\nClassical theism also distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties are those that define God's essence, while extrinsic properties can change without affecting God's fundamental nature. This distinction is crucial in discussions about divine immutability, as it allows for the acknowledgment of God's relational dynamics with creation without compromising His unchanging essence.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians, such as St. Thomas Aquinas, have linked divine immutability to God's simplicity, arguing that since God has no parts or attributes distinct from Himself, He cannot change. This view has been challenged by modern thinkers who argue for a more dynamic understanding of God's relationship with the world, but the classical view remains influential in traditional theological discourse.\n\nIn summary, classical theism defines divine immutability as God's unchanging nature in essence and perfection, while allowing for extrinsic changes in His actions and knowledge in response to the temporal world.
