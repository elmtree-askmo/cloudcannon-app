    How did C.S. Lewis's mother's illness and passing affect his faith and belief in God?
answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's mother's illness and subsequent passing had a profound impact on his faith and belief in God. When Lewis was just nine years old, he experienced the devastating loss of his mother, Florence, who died from cancer. This event marked a significant turning point in his life, leading him to question the existence of a benevolent God. He felt disillusioned and betrayed, believing that God had not intervened to heal her. This disillusionment catalyzed a long journey away from faith, during which Lewis embraced rationalism and atheism.\n\nIn his autobiography, *Surprised by Joy*, Lewis reflects on the deep sense of loss and insecurity that followed his mother's death, stating, "With my mother's death all settled happiness disappeared from my life." He described how this loss stripped away the sense of security he had known, leaving him feeling alienated not only from his family but also from his faith.\n\nDespite this initial turn away from belief, Lewis's journey back to faith was complex and filled with obstacles. He later identified moments of spiritual awakening, such as his encounter with George MacDonald's *Phantastes*, which he described as a time when his imagination was "baptized." This experience, along with the influence of friends like J.R.R. Tolkien, eventually led him to reconsider his views on God and spirituality.\n\nUltimately, Lewis's mother's death was a catalyst for his exploration of faith, leading him through a period of atheism and skepticism before he returned to Christianity. His reflections on this journey highlight the interplay between personal tragedy and spiritual awakening, illustrating how profound loss can lead to a deeper engagement with belief and the search for meaning.
