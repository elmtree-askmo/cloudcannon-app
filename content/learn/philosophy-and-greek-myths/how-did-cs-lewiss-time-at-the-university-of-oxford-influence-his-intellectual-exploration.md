    How did C.S. Lewis's time at the University of Oxford influence his intellectual exploration?
answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's time at the University of Oxford significantly influenced his intellectual exploration and development as a writer and thinker. He arrived at Oxford in 1917, where he initially pursued a scholarship at University College. His academic journey was briefly interrupted by military service during World War I, but he graduated with a double First in Greats (classical philosophy and history) in 1922, followed by a First in English in 1923.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Lewis became a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1925, a position he held until 1954. This role allowed him to engage deeply with literature and philosophy, shaping his views and writings. His academic environment fostered a rich intellectual community, where he interacted with other prominent thinkers and writers, including J.R.R. Tolkien, with whom he formed a close friendship. Together, they were part of the Inklings, a literary group that met regularly to discuss their works and ideas.\n\nLewis's experiences at Oxford also exposed him to the challenges of faith and intellectual discourse. He faced criticism for his beliefs and was sometimes overlooked for promotions, which contributed to his understanding of the complexities of faith and reason. This backdrop of academic rigor and personal struggle informed his later works, where he sought to articulate and defend the Christian faith in a rational manner.\n\nHis time at Oxford not only solidified his literary and theological foundations but also inspired him to write some of his most significant works, including "Mere Christianity" and "The Screwtape Letters." The intellectual environment of Oxford, combined with his personal experiences, played a crucial role in shaping Lewis's journey from atheism to a robust Christian faith, ultimately influencing his legacy as one of the most beloved Christian writers of the 20th century.
