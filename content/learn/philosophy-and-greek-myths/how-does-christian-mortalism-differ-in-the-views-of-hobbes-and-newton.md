    How does Christian mortalism differ in the views of Hobbes and Newton?
answer: >-
    Christian mortalism, which posits that the soul does not exist in an immortal state after death, is interpreted differently by Thomas Hobbes and Isaac Newton, reflecting their distinct philosophical and theological frameworks.\n\n1. **Thomas Hobbes**: Hobbes's view of the soul is fundamentally materialistic. He argues that the soul is corporeal and does not exist independently of the body. In his writings, particularly in "Leviathan," he emphasizes that the soul's existence is tied to the physical body, and once the body dies, the soul ceases to exist. This perspective aligns with his broader materialist philosophy, which rejects the notion of an immaterial soul that survives death. Hobbes's mortalism is thus a rejection of traditional Christian views on the immortality of the soul, positioning him as a radical thinker in the context of early modern philosophy.\n\n2. **Isaac Newton**: Newton's approach to Christian mortalism is more nuanced and arguably more aligned with a theistic framework. While he also rejected the orthodox doctrine of the soul's natural immortality, his views were influenced by his interpretation of biblical texts. Newton believed in a monotheistic God and saw the divine will as central to understanding existence. His mortalism suggests that he viewed the soul's existence as contingent upon God's will, and he entertained the idea of a non-eternal duration of hell-fire torments for the damned, which implies a different understanding of the afterlife compared to Hobbes. Newton's theological explorations led him to a form of mortalism that, while heretical by the standards of his time, still engaged with the complexities of Christian doctrine.\n\nIn summary, while both Hobbes and Newton can be classified as Christian mortalists, Hobbes's materialism leads him to a more definitive denial of the soul's immortality, whereas Newton's views incorporate a theological dimension that allows for a more complex relationship between divine will and the fate of the soul after death. This distinction highlights the broader philosophical implications of their respective positions within the context of early modern thought.
