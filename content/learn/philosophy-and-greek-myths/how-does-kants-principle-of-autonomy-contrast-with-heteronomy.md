    How does Kant's principle of autonomy contrast with heteronomy?
answer: >-
    Kant's principle of autonomy is fundamentally about self-legislation and the capacity of rational agents to create their own moral laws, independent of external influences. In contrast, heteronomy refers to actions that are determined by external factors or desires, rather than by one's own rational will. \n\n1. **Autonomy**: For Kant, autonomy is the ability of the will to act according to laws that it gives to itself. This means that moral agents are capable of determining their own maxims based on rational deliberation. Autonomy is essential for moral responsibility, as it implies that individuals are not merely following external commands or desires but are instead guided by their own rational principles. Kant emphasizes that true moral actions arise from this self-legislation, where individuals act according to maxims that they can will to become universal laws.\n\n2. **Heteronomy**: In contrast, heteronomy occurs when an individual's actions are influenced by external factors, such as desires or societal pressures. When a person acts out of heteronomy, their decisions are not based on rational deliberation but rather on fulfilling external ends or satisfying personal desires. Kant argues that actions resulting from heteronomy cannot be considered truly free or moral, as they do not stem from the individual's rational will.\n\nKant's ethical framework posits that moral duty arises from the autonomy of the will, which is necessary for genuine moral action. He asserts that all moral principles must be derived from rationality and that any deviation into heteronomy undermines the moral worth of an action. Thus, autonomy and heteronomy represent two opposing sources of moral principles, with autonomy being the ideal that Kant advocates for in his moral philosophy.
