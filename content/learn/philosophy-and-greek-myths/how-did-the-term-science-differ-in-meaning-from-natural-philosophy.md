    How did the term 'science' differ in meaning from 'natural philosophy'?
answer: >-
    The term 'science' has evolved significantly over time, particularly in its distinction from 'natural philosophy.' Historically, natural philosophy encompassed a broad range of inquiries into the nature of the universe, including metaphysical questions about existence, knowledge, and ethics. It was an intellectual discipline that sought to understand fundamental truths through reasoning and logical argumentation.\n\nIn contrast, science, derived from the Latin word *scientia* meaning "knowledge," is characterized by a systematic approach to studying the natural world through observation, experimentation, and empirical evidence. The primary goal of science is to uncover the mechanisms and laws governing the physical universe, relying on observable and quantifiable data. This empirical methodology distinguishes science from natural philosophy, which often relied on philosophical arguments and speculative reasoning.\n\nThe shift from natural philosophy to science became more pronounced during the Enlightenment, particularly with the influence of figures like Isaac Newton, whose work emphasized evidence-based methods for acquiring knowledge. As a result, natural philosophy began to be marginalized, and the term 'scientist' emerged in the 19th century to describe those who engaged in scientific inquiry, previously referred to as natural philosophers.\n\nIn summary, while both science and natural philosophy aim to uncover truths about the world, they differ fundamentally in their methods: science relies on empirical data and experimentation, whereas natural philosophy engages in broader philosophical discourse. This distinction marks a significant evolution in the understanding and practice of knowledge acquisition.
