    How did C.S. Lewis's questioning of God's intentions evolve over time?
answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's questioning of God's intentions evolved significantly throughout his life, reflecting a profound intellectual and spiritual journey. Initially, Lewis was a staunch atheist, rejecting the notion of God and viewing Christianity as a myth. His early skepticism was rooted in a belief that the existence of evil and suffering contradicted the idea of a benevolent deity. However, as he grappled with these concepts, he began to see evil and suffering not only as challenges to atheism but also as compelling arguments for the existence of God and the truth of Christianity.\n\nBy 1929, Lewis transitioned from agnosticism to theism, influenced by various factors, including the writings of Christian authors and conversations with friends like J.R.R. Tolkien. This shift marked the beginning of his journey toward Christianity, where he started to reconcile his intellectual pursuits with his emerging faith. He articulated his understanding of the Fall in a way that harmonized with his belief in human evolution, demonstrating a willingness to engage with complex theological issues.\n\nLewis's writings, particularly in works like *Mere Christianity*, reflect his evolving understanding of God's intentions. He emphasized that faith should not be accepted blindly but should be supported by reason and evidence. He famously stated, “I am not asking anyone to accept Christianity if his best reasoning tells him that the weight of evidence is against it.” This approach illustrates his commitment to intellectual honesty and the importance of questioning and understanding one's beliefs.\n\nUltimately, Lewis's journey culminated in a deep and enduring faith, where he recognized God's intentions as fundamentally good and purposeful. His experiences of personal tragedy and loss further shaped his understanding of faith, leading him to articulate a vision of God that embraced both mystery and love. Through his writings and lectures, Lewis became one of the most influential Christian apologists of the 20th century, encouraging others to engage with their beliefs thoughtfully and reflectively.
