    How did John Stuart Mill modify Bentham's utilitarianism?
answer: >-
    John Stuart Mill made several significant modifications to Jeremy Bentham's original formulation of utilitarianism, which primarily focused on the quantitative aspects of pleasure and pain. Here are the key distinctions:\n\n1. **Qualitative Distinction of Pleasures**: One of Mill's most notable contributions was the introduction of the distinction between higher and lower pleasures. While Bentham viewed pleasure as a uniform quantity that could be measured solely by its intensity and duration, Mill argued that not all pleasures are of equal value. He posited that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to mere physical pleasures (lower pleasures). This qualitative approach emphasized that the quality of happiness matters, not just the quantity.\n\n2. **Emphasis on Individual Rights**: Mill expanded Bentham's utilitarian framework to include considerations of individual rights and liberties. He believed that protecting individual rights is essential for promoting overall happiness, which was somewhat neglected in Bentham's more straightforward approach that focused on the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\n3. **Rule Utilitarianism vs. Act Utilitarianism**: While Bentham's utilitarianism is often classified as act utilitarianism—where the principle of utility is applied to individual actions—Mill's approach is more aligned with rule utilitarianism. This means that Mill advocated for following rules that generally promote the greatest happiness, rather than evaluating each action on a case-by-case basis. This shift helps to avoid justifying morally questionable actions if they result in a net increase in happiness.\n\n4. **Moral Motives and Altruism**: Mill also critiqued Bentham's utilitarianism for its lack of attention to moral motives and altruism. He believed that moral considerations and the intentions behind actions should play a role in ethical decision-making, which adds a layer of complexity to the utilitarian calculus.\n\n5. **Focus on Character and Individual Autonomy**: Mill emphasized the importance of individual character and self-realization, arguing that a person's development and autonomy are crucial for achieving true happiness. This perspective diverges from Bentham's more mechanistic view of pleasure and pain.\n\nIn summary, while both philosophers shared a commitment to the principle of utility, Mill's modifications introduced a more nuanced understanding of happiness that incorporates qualitative differences in pleasure, the importance of individual rights, and a broader ethical framework that considers moral motives and character.
