    What are the common obstacles to a strong relationship with God mentioned in the series?
answer: >-
    The "Stronger Than Ever" series highlights several common obstacles that can disrupt a strong relationship with God. These obstacles include:\n\n1. **Feeling of Worthlessness**: Many individuals struggle with believing they are deserving of God's love and belonging. This sense of worthlessness can create a significant barrier to connecting with God.\n\n2. **Anxiety**: Anxiety can distract individuals from focusing on their relationship with God. It often stems from various life pressures and can lead to bitterness, which further complicates one's spiritual connection.\n\n3. **Busyness of Daily Life**: The demands of work, school, and other responsibilities can make it challenging to find time for prayer and Bible reading, which are essential for nurturing a relationship with God.\n\n4. **Bitterness**: Holding onto bitterness from painful or unfair situations can poison one's relationship with God. It is important to seek healing and purpose in these experiences rather than allowing them to create distance from God.\n\n5. **Lack of Intentionality**: A lack of purpose in seeking God can hinder spiritual growth. Individuals must be deliberate in spending time in God's presence to deepen their relationship.\n\nThese obstacles can be overcome through various strategies, such as prioritizing time for spiritual practices, seeking community support, and maintaining a positive mindset. By addressing these challenges, individuals can work towards a more profound and passionate relationship with God.
