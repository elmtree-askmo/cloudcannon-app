    What are John Locke's key contributions to the theory of natural rights and liberal democracy?
answer: >-
    John Locke's contributions to the theory of natural rights and liberal democracy are foundational and have had a lasting impact on political philosophy. Here are the key aspects of his contributions:\n\n1. **Natural Rights**: Locke articulated the concept of natural rights, which are inherent rights that every individual possesses simply by being human. In his seminal work, *Two Treatises of Government*, he identified these rights as life, liberty, and property. Locke argued that these rights are not granted by any government but are inherent and must be protected by the government. This idea significantly influenced modern democratic thought and the development of human rights.\n\n2. **Social Contract Theory**: Locke's formulation of the social contract was a critical departure from the prevailing theories of absolute monarchy and divine right. He posited that legitimate government is based on the consent of the governed. This notion challenged the traditional authority of monarchs and laid the groundwork for modern democratic principles. According to Locke, individuals agree to form a government to protect their natural rights, and if the government fails to do so, citizens have the right to overthrow it.\n\n3. **Individual Rights and Government's Role**: Locke emphasized that the primary role of government is to protect the natural rights of individuals. This emphasis on individual rights was revolutionary and became a cornerstone of Enlightenment thought. His ideas were echoed in significant political documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, where Thomas Jefferson drew heavily on Locke's principles.\n\n4. **Influence on Political Revolutions**: Locke's ideas had a profound influence on both the American and French Revolutions. His advocacy for the protection of individual rights and the idea that government should be accountable to the people inspired revolutionary leaders and helped shape the political landscape of the time.\n\n5. **Foundation for Liberal Democracy**: Locke's theories laid the foundation for modern liberal democracy. His belief in the importance of individual rights, government by consent, and the social contract has been integral to the development of democratic institutions and practices.\n\nIn summary, John Locke's key contributions to the theory of natural rights and liberal democracy include his articulation of natural rights, the social contract theory, the emphasis on the government's role in protecting individual rights, and his influence on revolutionary movements. His ideas continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about human rights and democratic governance.
