answer: >-
    Frankfurt's thought experiment is a significant philosophical scenario that challenges the traditional view of free will, particularly the idea that free will necessitates the ability to choose otherwise. This thought experiment is central to the discussion of new compatibilism, a perspective notably advanced by philosopher Harry Frankfurt.\n\n### Description of Frankfurt's Thought Experiment\n\nIn one of his well-known scenarios, Frankfurt presents a situation involving a character, let's call him "Jones." Imagine that Jones is faced with a decision to perform an action, say, to vote for a particular candidate. Unbeknownst to Jones, there is a mechanism (let's say a device) that can intervene and ensure that he votes for that candidate if he shows any inclination to choose otherwise. However, Jones, acting on his own volition, decides to vote for the candidate without any coercion or influence from the device.\n\nThe crux of the thought experiment lies in the fact that, even though the device exists and could have forced Jones to vote differently, he still made the choice freely. Frankfurt argues that this scenario demonstrates that the ability to choose otherwise is not a necessary condition for moral responsibility or free will. Instead, what matters is that Jones acted according to his own desires and intentions.\n\n### Significance in the Context of New Compatibilism\n\nFrankfurt's thought experiment is significant for new compatibilism because it shifts the focus from the mere ability to choose differently to the structure of one's will and desires. New compatibilism posits that free will is about having the will one wants to have, which involves a deeper level of reflective self-evaluation. This means that individuals can be considered free and morally responsible for their actions as long as their actions align with their first-order desires (the desires to perform certain actions) and second-order desires (the desires about those desires).\n\nFor example, if Jones reflects on his desire to vote for the candidate and endorses that desire, he is exercising free will according to new compatibilism. The harmony between his first-order desire (to vote for the candidate) and his second-order desire (to want to have that desire) is what constitutes his freedom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Frankfurt's thought experiment is a pivotal element in the discussion of new compatibilism, as it effectively illustrates that moral responsibility and free will can exist even in the absence of alternative choices. This perspective emphasizes the importance of reflective self-evaluation and the alignment of desires, thereby providing a robust framework for understanding free will in a deterministic universe.
