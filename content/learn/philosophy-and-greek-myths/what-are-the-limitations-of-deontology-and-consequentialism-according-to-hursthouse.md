    What are the limitations of deontology and consequentialism according to Hursthouse?
answer: >-
    According to Rosalind Hursthouse, the limitations of deontology and consequentialism can be understood through her critique of these ethical theories in relation to virtue ethics. \n\n1. **Deontology**: Hursthouse argues that deontological theories often focus on universal rules or principles that dictate what actions are right or wrong, which can lead to rigid moral frameworks. This approach tends to overlook the importance of moral character and the virtues that contribute to being a good person. Deontologists may fail to consider the complexities of human emotions and relationships, which are essential in moral decision-making. Hursthouse suggests that this focus on rules can result in a lack of attention to the moral wisdom and discernment that come from understanding virtues and vices.\n\n2. **Consequentialism**: Hursthouse critiques consequentialism for its emphasis on the outcomes of actions as the primary measure of their moral worth. This perspective can lead to morally questionable actions being justified if they result in a favorable outcome. Hursthouse points out that consequentialism often neglects the significance of the agent's character and the motivations behind actions. By prioritizing results over the moral qualities of the individual, consequentialism can overlook the deeper ethical considerations that virtue ethics addresses, such as the kind of person one should strive to be.\n\nIn summary, Hursthouse highlights that both deontology and consequentialism can be limited by their focus on rules and outcomes, respectively, while virtue ethics provides a more holistic approach that emphasizes moral character, virtues, and the importance of moral wisdom in ethical decision-making.
