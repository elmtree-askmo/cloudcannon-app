    How does Primoratz justify his stance on retributivism?
answer: >-
    Igor Primoratz justifies his stance on retributivism through several key arguments that emphasize the moral and philosophical foundations of punishment. His approach is primarily rooted in the belief that punishment should be a deserved response to wrongdoing, reflecting a moral obligation to ensure justice.\n\n1. **Moral Theory of Persons**: Primoratz argues that retributivism is grounded in a moral theory that recognizes the importance of autonomous choice. He posits that individuals who commit crimes do so through their own free will, and thus they have a right to be punished. This perspective underscores the idea that punishment is not merely a societal tool for deterrence or rehabilitation, but a necessary response to the moral failing of the offender.\n\n2. **Expressive and Communicative Character of Punishment**: He aligns with the view that punishment serves an expressive function, conveying societal condemnation of the crime. This communicative aspect is essential in reaffirming the values and norms of the community, making it clear that certain behaviors are unacceptable. Primoratz emphasizes that punishment should reflect the severity of the crime, thereby maintaining a moral balance.\n\n3. **Proportionality**: Primoratz defends the principle of proportionality in punishment, arguing that the severity of the punishment should correspond to the gravity of the offense. He contends that there is no punishment equivalent to murder, which justifies the use of capital punishment in cases of murder. This stance is articulated in his work "A Life for A Life," where he argues against utilitarian perspectives that advocate for the abolition of the death penalty.\n\n4. **Critique of Utilitarianism**: Primoratz critiques utilitarian arguments against capital punishment, asserting that they fail to adequately address the moral dimensions of justice. He believes that utilitarianism often overlooks the intrinsic value of retribution and the need for a moral response to crime.\n\n5. **Social Context of Punishment**: He acknowledges that retributivism must consider the social context in which laws and punishments are applied. Drawing on Hegel, Primoratz suggests that the criminal code is a product of its time and reflects the moral judgments of society. This perspective allows for a dynamic understanding of retributivism that adapts to changing societal values while maintaining its core principles.\n\nIn summary, Primoratz's justification for retributivism is built on a framework that emphasizes moral responsibility, the expressive nature of punishment, proportionality, and the social context of legal systems. His arguments present a compelling case for viewing punishment as a necessary and just response to crime, rather than merely a means to an end.
