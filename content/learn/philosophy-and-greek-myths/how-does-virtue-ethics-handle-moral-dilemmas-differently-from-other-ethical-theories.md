    How does virtue ethics handle moral dilemmas differently from other ethical theories?
answer: >-
    Virtue ethics handles moral dilemmas differently from other ethical theories, such as utilitarianism and deontology, by focusing on the character of the moral agent rather than strictly adhering to rules or evaluating the consequences of actions. \n\n1. **Character-Centric Approach**: In virtue ethics, the emphasis is placed on the virtues and moral character of the individual making the decision. A person with good character is believed to possess the moral wisdom necessary to navigate dilemmas effectively. This contrasts with deontological theories, which rely on a set of universal rules to determine the right action, and utilitarianism, which evaluates actions based on their outcomes.\n\n2. **Moral Wisdom and Experience**: Virtue ethics recognizes the importance of moral wisdom, which is developed through experience and reflection. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of moral dilemmas, as it considers the complexities of human emotions and relationships. Rosalind Hursthouse, a prominent figure in contemporary virtue ethics, argues that moral dilemmas should be approached with an understanding of the virtues relevant to the situation, rather than through rigid rules.\n\n3. **Flexibility and Context**: Unlike other ethical theories that may provide a one-size-fits-all solution, virtue ethics allows for flexibility in decision-making. It acknowledges that moral dilemmas often involve competing virtues and that the right course of action may vary depending on the context. This adaptability is a significant strength of virtue ethics, as it aligns with the reality of human moral experience.\n\n4. **Holistic Perspective**: Virtue ethics offers a comprehensive view of ethics as a journey toward becoming a better person. It emphasizes the development of good character traits and the importance of intentions and motivations behind actions. This holistic approach contrasts with the more fragmented views of utilitarianism and deontology, which can sometimes overlook the moral agent's character.\n\nIn summary, virtue ethics addresses moral dilemmas by prioritizing the character and virtues of the individual, emphasizing moral wisdom and experience, allowing for flexibility in decision-making, and adopting a holistic perspective on ethical behavior. This approach provides a rich framework for understanding and resolving moral dilemmas in a way that is deeply connected to the individual's moral character.
