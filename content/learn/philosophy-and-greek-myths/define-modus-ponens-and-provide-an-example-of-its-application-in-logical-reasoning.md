    Modus Ponens is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic that allows one to draw conclusions from conditional statements when the antecedent is true. It is widely applicable in various fields such as mathematics and philosophy.

    Define Modus Ponens and provide an example of its application in logical reasoning.
answer: >-
    Modus Ponens is a fundamental rule of inference in propositional logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement of the form $ P \rightarrow Q $ (if P then Q) and we know that $ P $ is true, we can conclude that $ Q $ must also be true. This rule can be formally expressed as follows:\n\n1. $ P \rightarrow Q $ (If P, then Q)\n2. $ P $ (P is true)\n3. Therefore, $ Q $ (Q is true)\n\n### Example of Modus Ponens in Logical Reasoning\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n1. If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). This can be expressed as $ P \rightarrow Q $.\n2. It is raining (P).\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can conclude:\n\n3. Therefore, the ground is wet (Q).\n\nThis example illustrates how Modus Ponens allows us to derive a conclusion based on the truth of a conditional statement and the affirmation of its antecedent. It is a powerful tool in logical reasoning and is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy to establish valid arguments.
