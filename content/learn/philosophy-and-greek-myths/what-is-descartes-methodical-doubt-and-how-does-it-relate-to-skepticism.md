    What is Descartes' methodical doubt and how does it relate to skepticism?
answer: >-
    Descartes' methodical doubt, also known as Cartesian doubt, is a systematic approach to questioning the certainty of knowledge and beliefs, primarily associated with the philosopher René Descartes. This technique involves doubting all beliefs that can possibly be doubted in order to establish a foundation of indubitable knowledge. Descartes aimed to reach absolute certainty, which he ultimately found in the famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). This assertion became the cornerstone of his philosophy, as it was one belief that he could not doubt.\n\nThe methodical doubt is a form of methodological skepticism, which means it is a deliberate and structured way of questioning the reliability of knowledge claims. Descartes classified statements according to their type and source of knowledge—such as knowledge from tradition, empirical knowledge, and mathematical knowledge—and examined examples from each class to identify any that could be doubted. This process led him to entertain a form of global skepticism, where he considered the possibility that he might not know anything at all to be true or false.\n\nIn relation to skepticism, Descartes' methodical doubt serves as a vehicle to motivate deeper inquiry into the nature of knowledge. While he is not a skeptic in the traditional sense—since he ultimately seeks to establish certain knowledge—his approach embodies the skeptical spirit of questioning and challenging the reliability of any claim or assumption. This method highlights the limitations of human understanding and the need for a solid foundation upon which to build knowledge, thus bridging the gap between skepticism and the pursuit of certainty in philosophical inquiry.
