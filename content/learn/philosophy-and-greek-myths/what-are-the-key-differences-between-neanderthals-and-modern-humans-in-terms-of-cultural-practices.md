    What are the key differences between Neanderthals and modern humans in terms of cultural practices?
answer: >-
    Neanderthals and modern humans (Homo sapiens) exhibited several key differences in their cultural practices, despite sharing a significant amount of genetic material and some behavioral similarities. Here are the main distinctions:\n\n1. **Artistic Expression**: Neanderthals engaged in cultural practices that included the creation of art, such as painted lines and dots found in caves, which predate the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe. This challenges the notion that artistic expression was exclusive to modern humans. However, the extent and complexity of Neanderthal art appear to be less developed compared to the diverse artistic expressions seen in early Homo sapiens, which included more sophisticated forms of art, such as cave paintings and carvings.\n\n2. **Tool Technology**: Neanderthals utilized the Mousterian tool culture, characterized by the production of flake tools, while modern humans developed the Aurignacian tool culture, which included a wider variety of tools and more advanced techniques. Neanderthals made tools for specific tasks, such as hunting and leatherworking, but the diversity and innovation in tool-making seem to have been greater in Homo sapiens.\n\n3. **Social Structures and Burial Practices**: Neanderthals demonstrated complex social behaviors, including burial practices that suggest a level of symbolic thought and possibly spiritual beliefs. They arranged bodies and sometimes included grave goods, indicating a form of ancestor reverence. While modern humans also practiced burial and had complex social structures, the rituals and the symbolic meanings attached to them were likely more elaborate and varied among early Homo sapiens.\n\n4. **Diet and Subsistence Strategies**: Neanderthals had a varied diet that included large game, smaller animals, and plant materials, adapting their hunting strategies based on available resources. While modern humans also had diverse diets, they exhibited greater flexibility and innovation in their subsistence strategies, including the development of agriculture during the Agricultural Revolution, which significantly transformed human societies.\n\n5. **Cognitive and Cultural Flexibility**: Some researchers suggest that Neanderthal behavior may have been more conservative or less adaptable compared to modern humans, potentially leading to differences in cultural evolution. This includes speculations about neophobia (fear of new things) and dogmatism in Neanderthal behavior, which may have limited their cultural development compared to the more innovative and adaptive strategies of Homo sapiens.\n\nIn summary, while Neanderthals exhibited a rich cultural life with social intelligence and some artistic expression, the overall complexity, diversity, and adaptability of cultural practices in modern humans were likely more advanced, contributing to the eventual dominance of Homo sapiens over Neanderthals.
