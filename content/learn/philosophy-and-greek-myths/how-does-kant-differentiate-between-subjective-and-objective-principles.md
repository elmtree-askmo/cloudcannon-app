    How does Kant differentiate between subjective and objective principles?
answer: >-
    Immanuel Kant differentiates between subjective and objective principles primarily through the concepts of maxims and practical laws. In his moral philosophy, particularly in the "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals," Kant defines a maxim as the subjective principle of volition. This means that a maxim is a personal rule or guideline that an individual adopts for their actions, shaped by their own desires and circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the objective principle is what Kant refers to as the practical law. This principle is not merely subjective; it is a rule that would be valid for all rational beings if reason were fully in control of their desires. The practical law embodies a form of universality, which is essential for it to be considered a law in the moral sense. It is through the Categorical Imperative that Kant articulates this objective principle, stating that one should act only according to that maxim which one can will to become a universal law.\n\nIn summary, the key distinctions are as follows:\n- **Subjective Principle (Maxim)**: A personal rule for action that reflects individual desires and conditions.\n- **Objective Principle (Practical Law)**: A universal rule that applies to all rational beings, independent of individual inclinations, and is capable of being a law.\n\nKant emphasizes that for moral actions to be valid, the subjective maxims must align with the objective principles, ensuring that personal intentions can be universally applied. This alignment is crucial for the moral duty and rationality that Kant advocates in his ethical framework.
