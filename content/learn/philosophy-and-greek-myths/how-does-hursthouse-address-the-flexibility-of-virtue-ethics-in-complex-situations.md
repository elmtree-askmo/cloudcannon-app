    How does Hursthouse address the flexibility of virtue ethics in complex situations?
answer: >-
    Rosalind Hursthouse addresses the flexibility of virtue ethics in complex situations by emphasizing the importance of context and the moral significance of emotions. In her work, particularly in "On Virtue Ethics," she argues that virtue ethics does not prescribe a rigid set of rules or principles that must be followed in every situation. Instead, it encourages individuals to analyze each situation separately, taking into account the specific facts and ethical sensitivities involved.\n\nHursthouse posits that a virtuous person would consider what a morally exemplary individual would do in a given circumstance. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of moral dilemmas, as it recognizes that different situations may require different responses based on the virtues relevant to those contexts. For example, if a patient refuses a blood transfusion not out of a strong personal belief but due to familial pressure, the virtuous response may differ significantly from a straightforward application of rules.\n\nThis flexibility is a key feature of virtue ethics, as it allows for moral wisdom and discernment to guide actions rather than relying solely on universal principles. Hursthouse's perspective highlights that moral education and the development of character are essential in navigating complex ethical landscapes, where emotions and relationships play a critical role in decision-making. Thus, virtue ethics, as articulated by Hursthouse, provides a framework that is adaptable and sensitive to the intricacies of human experience.
