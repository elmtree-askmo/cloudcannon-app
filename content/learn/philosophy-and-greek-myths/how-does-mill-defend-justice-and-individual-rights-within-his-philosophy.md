    How does Mill defend justice and individual rights within his philosophy?
answer: >-
    John Stuart Mill's defense of justice and individual rights is intricately woven into his broader philosophical framework, particularly in his works "On Liberty" and "Utilitarianism." Mill's approach to justice is distinctive because he seeks to reconcile the principles of utilitarianism with the moral imperatives of justice and individual rights.\n\n1. **Justice as a Component of Utility**: In "Utilitarianism," Mill addresses the relationship between justice and utility, arguing that justice is not merely a set of moral rules but is deeply connected to the promotion of overall happiness. He contends that the moral elements of justice are grounded in social utility, meaning that rights are claims that society protects because they contribute to the greater good. This perspective allows Mill to argue that individual rights are essential for achieving the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\n2. **Rights and Duties**: Mill explicitly introduces his theory of rights in Chapter 5 of "Utilitarianism," where he differentiates justice from general morality. He defines justice as duties linked to the rights of individuals, emphasizing that these rights are not arbitrary but are essential for the protection of individual liberty. Mill argues that the protection of individual rights is crucial for social stability and the promotion of happiness, as it fosters an environment where individuals can pursue their own interests without infringing on the rights of others.\n\n3. **Liberty and Self-Determination**: In "On Liberty," Mill articulates a robust defense of individual freedom, asserting that individuals should have the liberty to make choices about their own lives as long as their actions do not harm others. This principle of non-harm is central to Mill's philosophy, as it establishes a boundary for individual freedom that respects the rights of others. He posits that the exercise of individual liberty is vital for personal development and societal progress.\n\n4. **Critique of Utilitarianism**: Mill acknowledges the criticisms of utilitarianism, particularly the concern that it may lead to the violation of individual rights in the name of the greater good. He counters this by arguing that a true understanding of utility must incorporate justice and individual rights, thus ensuring that the pursuit of happiness does not come at the expense of fundamental human rights.\n\n5. **Influence of John Locke**: Mill's ideas on individual rights are also influenced by John Locke, who emphasized the importance of property rights and self-ownership. Mill builds on this foundation by advocating for a broader conception of rights that includes personal liberties and social justice.\n\nIn summary, Mill defends justice and individual rights by linking them to the principles of utility, emphasizing the importance of protecting individual freedoms, and arguing that a just society is one that safeguards the rights of its members. His philosophy remains a significant contribution to discussions on liberty, justice, and the role of government in protecting individual rights.
