    How did C.S. Lewis's understanding of myths change after his discussions with J.R.R. Tolkien?
answer: >-
    C.S. Lewis's understanding of myths underwent a significant transformation following his discussions with J.R.R. Tolkien. Initially, Lewis viewed myths as mere fictional narratives, but through his conversations with Tolkien, he began to appreciate the deeper significance of myth in conveying truth about God.\n\nTolkien argued that while ancient myths were created by humans, the story of Christianity represented a "true myth"â€”a narrative that, unlike others, was rooted in historical fact. This perspective helped Lewis to see that myths could serve as vehicles for divine truth, revealing glimpses of a greater reality. He came to accept the Gospels as a form of myth that was not only meaningful but also true in a profound sense. This shift in understanding allowed Lewis to embrace the idea that pagan myths contained fragments of truth that pointed towards the ultimate truth found in Christianity.\n\nAs a result of these discussions, Lewis's own myth-making became evident in his later works, such as "The Chronicles of Narnia" and "The Space Trilogy," where he sought to communicate Christian themes through imaginative storytelling. This evolution in his thought was pivotal in his journey to faith and in shaping his literary contributions, which aimed to articulate and share the Christian faith in a compelling manner.
