    What is the genitive plural form of 'Os Ilium'?
answer: >-
    The genitive plural form of "Os Ilium" is "Ossium Iliorum." \n\nIn Latin, "os" (meaning "bone") is a third declension noun, and its genitive plural form is "ossium." The term "Ilium" refers to the ilium bone, and when used in the genitive plural, it becomes "Iliorum." Therefore, when combined, the full genitive plural form is "Ossium Iliorum," which translates to "of the bones of the ilium." \n\nThis structure follows the rules of Latin declension, where the genitive plural typically indicates possession or relation.
