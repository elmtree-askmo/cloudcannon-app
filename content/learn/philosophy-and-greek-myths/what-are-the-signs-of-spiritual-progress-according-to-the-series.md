answer: >-
    According to the "Stronger Than Ever" series, signs of spiritual progress can be identified through various indicators that reflect personal transformation and growth in one's relationship with God. Here are some key signs of spiritual progress:\n\n1. **Increased Self-Awareness**: A heightened sense of self-awareness is often one of the first signs of spiritual transformation. Individuals may find themselves more reflective and conscious of their thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n\n2. **Stronger Sense of Spirituality**: As one progresses spiritually, there is typically a growing connection to something greater than oneself. This can manifest in more meaningful moments of prayer and reflection, leading to a deeper sense of peace.\n\n3. **Hunger for Truth**: A desire to seek and study God's Word is a significant indicator of spiritual growth. This hunger for truth often leads to a commitment to understanding and applying biblical teachings in daily life.\n\n4. **Better Choices**: Spiritual growth is reflected in the choices individuals make. As they grow, they tend to make decisions that align more closely with their faith and values, demonstrating obedience to what they have learned.\n\n5. **Community Engagement**: Active participation in church activities and involvement in a local faith community are important signs of spiritual growth. Engaging with others who share similar beliefs fosters love, humility, and accountability.\n\n6. **Transformation in Relationships**: As individuals grow spiritually, they often experience changes in their relationships, becoming more loving, forgiving, and compassionate towards others.\n\n7. **Internal Peace and Joy**: A sense of internal peace and joy, even amidst life's challenges, can indicate spiritual maturity. This peace often stems from a deepening relationship with God.\n\n8. **Desire to Make a Difference**: A growing desire to serve others and make a positive impact in the community is another sign of spiritual progress. This reflects a commitment to living out one's faith in practical ways.\n\nRecognizing these signs can help individuals understand and embrace the changes they are experiencing on their spiritual journey, encouraging them to continue seeking God and growing in their faith.
