    Argument validity is defined as the logical structure of an argument where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises; it must meet criteria such as truth of hypotheses, truth of conclusion, and tautology condition.

answer: >-
    **Definition of Argument Validity:**\n\nArgument validity refers to the logical structure of an argument where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises (hypotheses). An argument is considered valid if, whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This can be formally expressed as:\n\n$$(H_1 \land H_2 \land \ldots \land H_n) \implies C$$\n\nwhere $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n$ represent the hypotheses and $C$ denotes the conclusion.\n\n**Criteria for Validity:**\n\nFor an argument to be considered valid, the following criteria must be met:\n\n1. **Truth of Hypotheses**: All premises (hypotheses) must be true.\n2. **Truth of Conclusion**: The conclusion must also be true whenever all the premises are true.\n3. **Tautology Condition**: The expression \((H_1 \land H_2 \land \ldots \land H_n) \implies C\) must be a tautology, meaning it is true in all possible interpretations.\n\n**Methods for Assessing Validity:**\n\n1. **Truth Tables**: A systematic evaluation method where a truth table is constructed to check the truth values of the hypotheses and conclusion. Critical rows (where all hypotheses are true) are identified, and the truth value of the conclusion is checked in these rows. If the conclusion is false in any critical row, the argument is invalid.\n\n2. **Rules of Inference**: These are logical rules that help derive conclusions from premises. Common rules include:\n   - Modus Ponens\n   - Modus Tollens\n   - Disjunctive Syllogism\n   - Hypothetical Syllogism\n   - Conjunction\n   - Simplification\n   - Addition\n   - Resolution\n\nIn summary, an argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and this can be verified through truth tables or rules of inference.
