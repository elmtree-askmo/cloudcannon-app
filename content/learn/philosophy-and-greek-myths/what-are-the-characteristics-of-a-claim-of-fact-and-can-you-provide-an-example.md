    What are the characteristics of a claim of fact and can you provide an example?
answer: >-
    A claim of fact is a statement that asserts something is true or false and can be proven or disproven with factual evidence. The characteristics of a claim of fact include:\n\n1. **Verifiability**: It can be supported or refuted by evidence, such as statistics, records, or observations.\n2. **Objectivity**: It is based on objective data rather than personal opinions or beliefs.\n3. **Debatable Nature**: While it is a statement of fact, it can still be subject to debate if the evidence supporting it is contested.\n\nFor example, the assertion that "the 2020 national budget is Php4.1 trillion" is a claim of fact. This statement can be verified through official government records, making it a factual claim that can be proven true or false based on available evidence. \n\nAnother example could be: "Climate change is caused by human activities." This claim can be supported by scientific studies and data, making it a claim of fact that is open to discussion and debate based on the evidence presented.
