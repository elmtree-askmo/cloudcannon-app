    How does Newtonian dualism describe the nature and extension of minds in space?
answer: >-
    Newtonian dualism presents a unique perspective on the nature and extension of minds in space, diverging from the more traditional Cartesian dualism. While Cartesian dualism posits that the mind is an unextended, immaterial substance (res cogitans) distinct from the extended, material body (res extensa), Newton's view incorporates a more integrated understanding of mind and body.\n\nAccording to the gathered information, Newton explicitly rejects the Cartesian notion of "nullibism," which suggests that minds are nowhere located. Instead, he asserts that "God is everywhere, created minds are somewhere and body is in the space that it occupies." This indicates that, in Newtonian dualism, minds are not only present but also have a specific location in space, which aligns with the physical presence of bodies.\n\nNewton contends that minds are extended and locally present, challenging the Cartesian idea that minds lack extension. This perspective implies that mental phenomena are not entirely separate from the physical realm; rather, they occupy a space that is consistent with the physical properties of the universe. Thus, while Newton acknowledges a distinction between mind and body, he does not adhere to the strict separation that characterizes Cartesian dualism.\n\nIn summary, Newtonian dualism describes minds as entities that are both distinct from and yet integrated with the physical world, possessing a spatial presence that aligns with the material bodies they interact with. This view reflects a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between mind and body, emphasizing their interconnectedness within the framework of early modern philosophy and metaphysics.
