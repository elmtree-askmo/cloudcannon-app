answer: >-
    The key developments in early liberalism during the 17th and 18th centuries were marked by significant philosophical contributions and a shift in societal structures. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Origins and Response to Medieval Structures**: Early liberalism emerged as a reaction against the rigid hierarchies of medieval society, characterized by ascribed status and religious conformity. It emphasized individual liberty and equality, advocating for a transition to achieved status, where individuals could rise based on merit rather than birth.\n\n2. **Philosophical Contributions**:\n   - **Thomas Hobbes**: In his work "Leviathan," Hobbes introduced the concept of the social contract, arguing that individuals surrender certain freedoms to a sovereign authority in exchange for security and order. His ideas laid the groundwork for the liberal premise of individual freedom and equality, albeit with a strong emphasis on political authority.\n   - **John Locke**: Locke's theories significantly shaped liberal thought. He argued for limited government and the protection of natural rightsâ€”life, liberty, and property. His social contract theory posited that governments derive their authority from the consent of the governed and that citizens have the right to overthrow a government that fails to protect their rights.\n   - **Adam Smith**: Often regarded as the father of modern economics, Smith introduced economic liberalism in his seminal work "The Wealth of Nations." He advocated for free markets and minimal government intervention, introducing the concept of the "invisible hand" to describe how individual self-interest in a free market can lead to economic prosperity for all.\n\n3. **Economic Liberalism and Capitalism**: The 18th century saw a shift towards economic freedoms, with critiques of mercantilism and advocacy for free trade and competition. This laid the foundation for modern capitalism, emphasizing the importance of individual economic agency and the benefits of a market-driven economy.\n\n4. **Human Nature and Individual Freedom**: Early liberalism posited a view of human nature as rational and self-governing. It promoted the idea that individuals should have the freedom to pursue their own life projects without undue interference, which became a cornerstone of liberal philosophy.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: The rise of liberalism was influenced by the Enlightenment, which challenged absolute monarchy, feudalism, and religious persecution. Key historical events, such as the American and French Revolutions, further solidified liberal ideals and their implementation in governance.\n\nIn summary, early liberalism in the 17th and 18th centuries was characterized by a philosophical shift towards individual rights, limited government, and economic freedom, driven by influential thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Smith, and shaped by the historical context of the Enlightenment and revolutionary movements.
