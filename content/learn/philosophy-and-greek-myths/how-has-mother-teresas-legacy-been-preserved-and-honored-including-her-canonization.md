    How has Mother Teresa's legacy been preserved and honored, including her canonization?
answer: >-
    Mother Teresa's legacy has been preserved and honored in various significant ways, particularly following her canonization as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. She was canonized on September 4, 2016, in a ceremony held in St. Peter's Square, attended by tens of thousands of pilgrims. This event marked a pivotal moment in recognizing her lifelong dedication to serving the poorest of the poor, particularly through her work in Kolkata, India.\n\nThe canonization process began with the recognition of a miracle attributed to her intercession, which occurred in 2008 but was only formally acknowledged in 2013. This timing coincided with the Jubilee of Mercy, a theme that resonated with her mission of compassion and service. During the canonization ceremony, Pope Francis highlighted her efforts to make the world aware of the "crime of poverty," emphasizing her role as a voice for the marginalized.\n\nIn addition to her canonization, Mother Teresa's legacy continues to be honored through various initiatives and commemorations. For instance, on the first anniversary of her canonization, she was named co-patron of the Calcutta Archdiocese, alongside St. Francis Xavier. This recognition further solidifies her impact on the local community and the Church.\n\nMother Teresa's work has inspired numerous humanitarian projects and institutions worldwide, including hospitals and schools named in her honor. The Missionaries of Charity, the order she founded in 1950, has expanded globally, continuing her mission of care and compassion. Her life and teachings serve as a reminder of the profound impact that individual acts of love and kindness can have on the world, motivating countless individuals and organizations to engage in charitable efforts.\n\nOverall, Mother Teresa's legacy is preserved not only through her canonization but also through the ongoing work of the Missionaries of Charity and the many lives she touched during her lifetime and beyond.
