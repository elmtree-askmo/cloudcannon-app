    What are the core principles of utilitarianism?
answer: >-
    Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that emphasizes the outcomes of actions as the primary basis for determining their moral worth. Here are the core principles of utilitarianism:\n\n1. **Greatest Happiness Principle**: This foundational principle asserts that the rightness of an action is determined by its ability to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. When making decisions, one should consider the overall impact on well-being and prioritize actions that yield the most benefit.\n\n2. **Consequentialism**: Utilitarianism is inherently consequentialist, meaning that it evaluates the morality of actions based solely on their consequences. An action is deemed morally right if it leads to positive outcomes, such as increased happiness or reduced suffering.\n\n3. **Welfarism**: This principle posits that the only thing that has intrinsic value is well-being or happiness. Therefore, actions are judged based on their contributions to the overall welfare of individuals affected by those actions.\n\n4. **Impartiality**: Utilitarianism holds that everyone's happiness counts equally. This means that when making ethical decisions, one should not give preferential treatment to oneself or to specific individuals; rather, the well-being of all individuals should be considered impartially.\n\n5. **Aggregationism**: This principle involves summing up the benefits and harms of an action across all individuals affected. The overall utility of an action is determined by aggregating the positive and negative consequences for everyone involved.\n\n6. **Hedonism (in classical utilitarianism)**: Classical utilitarianism, as articulated by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, includes hedonism as a key element, which suggests that pleasure or happiness is the only intrinsic good. Thus, actions are evaluated based on their ability to produce pleasure and minimize pain.\n\nThese principles collectively guide utilitarian thought, emphasizing the importance of maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering in ethical decision-making.
