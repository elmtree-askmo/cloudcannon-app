    What are the core principles of utilitarianism?
answer: >-
    Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that emphasizes the maximization of happiness and the minimization of suffering for the greatest number of individuals. Here are the core principles of utilitarianism:\n\n1. **Greatest Happiness Principle**: The fundamental idea is that actions are morally right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. This principle guides decision-making by prioritizing actions that yield the most benefit to the majority.\n\n2. **Consequentialism**: Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, meaning that the morality of an action is judged based on its outcomes. The focus is on the results of actions rather than the intentions behind them.\n\n3. **Welfarism**: This principle asserts that the well-being of individuals is the primary measure of moral value. Utilitarianism seeks to enhance overall welfare, considering the happiness and suffering of all affected individuals.\n\n4. **Impartiality**: Utilitarianism holds that everyone's happiness counts equally. When making moral decisions, one should consider the interests of all individuals affected by the action without giving preferential treatment to any particular person or group.\n\n5. **Aggregationism**: This principle involves summing up the benefits and harms produced by an action to determine its overall utility. The goal is to achieve the highest net positive outcome when evaluating different actions.\n\n6. **Types of Utilitarianism**: There are two main forms of utilitarianism:\n   - **Act Utilitarianism**: This approach evaluates the consequences of each individual action to determine its moral worth.\n   - **Rule Utilitarianism**: This perspective assesses the consequences of following a rule of conduct, advocating for rules that generally lead to the greatest good.\n\n7. **Hedonism**: Classical utilitarianism often incorporates hedonism, which defines happiness in terms of pleasure and the absence of pain. Thus, actions are considered good if they increase pleasure and reduce pain.\n\nUtilitarianism encourages individuals to seek the best possible outcomes for society as a whole, making it a significant framework in discussions of moral dilemmas, medical ethics, and philosophical questions about morality.
