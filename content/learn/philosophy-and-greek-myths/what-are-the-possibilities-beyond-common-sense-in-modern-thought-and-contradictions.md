    What are the possibilities beyond common sense in modern thought and contradictions?
answer: >-
    In modern thought, the possibilities beyond common sense are vast and often lead to contradictions that challenge traditional understandings of reality. The shift from a priori reasoning, which relies on established principles and logical deductions, to a more empirical approach emphasizes the limitations of human knowledge and the complexities of existence.\n\n1. **Open World of Possibilities**: The modern philosophical landscape recognizes an "open world of free possibilities," where much remains unknown. This perspective suggests that the universe cannot be fully prescribed by a priori principles, as these principles often fail to account for the infinite complexities of reality. Logic, rather than constraining possibilities, liberates the imagination, allowing for numerous alternatives that common sense may overlook.\n\n2. **Illusory Contradictions**: Many metaphysical attempts have historically sought to prove that certain features of reality are self-contradictory. However, contemporary thought increasingly argues that these contradictions may be illusory. For instance, the nature of space and time, which appear infinite and infinitely divisible, challenges our intuitive understanding. The difficulty in conceptualizing a final point in space or time illustrates the limitations of common sense when grappling with the infinite.\n\n3. **Hegel's Dialectical Method**: Central to Hegel's philosophy is the dialectical method, which posits that contradictions are not merely obstacles but essential components of understanding reality. Hegel's approach emphasizes the synthesis of opposing ideas, allowing for a more cohesive understanding of existence. This method encourages a deeper engagement with the complexities of reality, moving beyond fragmented perceptions to a holistic view.\n\n4. **Relational Character of Existence**: Hegel's notion of "determinate being" (Dasein) highlights the interplay between possibility and necessity, suggesting that our understanding must transcend mere appearances to grasp the underlying causal powers of reality. This relational character of existence implies that knowledge is not static but evolves through the resolution of contradictions and the integration of diverse perspectives.\n\n5. **Fragmentary View of Reality**: The modern philosophical inquiry often reveals a fragmentary view of reality, where knowledge is pieced together from various experiences and descriptions. This approach acknowledges that while we may lack direct experience of certain phenomena, we can still gain insights through the connection of universals and the principles of causality.\n\nIn summary, modern thought expands the boundaries of common sense by embracing the complexities and contradictions inherent in reality. Through the dialectical method and an emphasis on empirical knowledge, philosophers like Hegel provide frameworks for understanding the dynamic and interconnected nature of existence, ultimately guiding us toward a more profound comprehension of absolute reality.
