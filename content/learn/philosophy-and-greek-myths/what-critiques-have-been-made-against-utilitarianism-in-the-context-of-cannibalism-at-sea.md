    What critiques have been made against utilitarianism in the context of cannibalism at sea?
answer: >-
    Critiques of utilitarianism in the context of cannibalism at sea, particularly illustrated by the infamous case of Queen v. Dudley and Stephens, highlight several ethical concerns and moral dilemmas associated with this philosophical framework.\n\n1. **Moral Validity of Actions**: Utilitarianism posits that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences, specifically the greatest good for the greatest number. In the case of cannibalism at sea, the decision to kill the weakest member of the crew (the cabin boy) for the survival of the others raises questions about the moral validity of such an action. Critics argue that utilitarianism can justify heinous acts if they lead to a perceived greater good, which can undermine moral principles and human dignity.\n\n2. **Human Dignity and Rights**: Critics emphasize that utilitarianism often overlooks individual rights and the intrinsic value of human life. The act of cannibalism, even in desperate circumstances, can be seen as a violation of the cabin boy's rights and dignity. This critique suggests that a purely utilitarian approach may lead to morally unacceptable conclusions, as it prioritizes collective survival over individual rights.\n\n3. **Disgust and Moral Intuition**: The emotional response of disgust plays a significant role in moral assessments of cannibalism. Critics argue that utilitarianism fails to account for these intuitive moral feelings, which can be crucial in ethical decision-making. The discomfort associated with cannibalism may indicate deeper moral truths that utilitarian calculations cannot adequately address.\n\n4. **Long-term Consequences**: While utilitarianism focuses on immediate outcomes, critics argue that it neglects the long-term societal implications of normalizing acts like cannibalism. Allowing such actions could lead to a societal acceptance of violence and a breakdown of moral norms, ultimately producing more unhappiness than happiness in the broader context.\n\n5. **Higher and Lower Pleasures**: John Stuart Mill, a prominent utilitarian philosopher, introduced the distinction between higher and lower pleasures. Critics of utilitarianism argue that in extreme situations like cannibalism at sea, the focus on survival (a lower pleasure) may overshadow higher pleasures associated with moral integrity and respect for human life. This raises questions about the adequacy of utilitarianism in addressing complex moral dilemmas.\n\nIn summary, critiques of utilitarianism in the context of cannibalism at sea highlight significant ethical concerns regarding the justification of actions based solely on their consequences, the neglect of individual rights, the role of moral intuitions, and the potential long-term societal impacts of such decisions. These critiques suggest that a more nuanced ethical framework may be necessary to navigate the complexities of moral dilemmas in extreme situations.
