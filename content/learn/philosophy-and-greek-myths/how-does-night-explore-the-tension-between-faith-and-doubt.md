    How does "Night" explore the tension between faith and doubt?
answer: >-
    In Elie Wiesel's memoir "Night," the tension between faith and doubt is a central theme that unfolds through the harrowing experiences of the protagonist, Eliezer. Initially, Eliezer is depicted as a devout Jew, deeply engaged in his religious studies and rituals. However, as he endures the atrocities of the Holocaust, his faith is profoundly challenged.\n\nOne of the pivotal moments illustrating this tension occurs during Yom Kippur, when Eliezer chooses not to fast. This decision is influenced both by his father's advice and a deeper, more troubling realization: he has lost his faith in God. Wiesel employs rhetorical devices, such as anaphora, to emphasize Eliezer's disillusionment, repeating phrases like "Never shall I forget" to convey the weight of his experiences and the resulting spiritual crisis.\n\nThroughout "Night," Eliezer grapples with the question of God's existence in the face of unimaginable suffering. He witnesses horrific acts, including the deaths of fellow prisoners and the brutal treatment of his own father, which lead him to question the justice and benevolence of a higher power. The pervasive imagery of darkness symbolizes this loss of faith, with the night representing death and the absence of God. Eliezer's struggle is encapsulated in his reflections, where he expresses feelings of numbness and despair, ultimately declaring that he may never believe in God again.\n\nDespite this profound loss, Wiesel's narrative does not completely sever the connection to faith. Eliezer's internal conflict reveals a complex relationship with God, where doubt coexists with a lingering hope for divine presence. Even as he confronts the depths of human cruelty, the struggle to maintain faith remains a poignant aspect of his journey.\n\nIn summary, "Night" explores the tension between faith and doubt through Eliezer's transformation from a devout believer to a young man grappling with the absence of God amidst suffering. This theme serves as a powerful commentary on the human condition, the search for meaning in the face of despair, and the moral dilemmas that arise during times of extreme adversity.
