    What is pure a priori knowledge and how is it different from empirical knowledge?
answer: >-
    Pure a priori knowledge refers to knowledge that is acquired independently of any particular experience. This concept has been significantly developed in Western philosophy, particularly by Immanuel Kant in his work, *The Critique of Pure Reason*. Kant distinguishes a priori knowledge from a posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge derived from experience.\n\nA priori knowledge is characterized by its independence from empirical observation. It includes truths that can be known through reason alone, such as mathematical propositions (e.g., $2 + 2 = 4$) and logical tautologies (e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried"). These types of knowledge do not require sensory experience for their validation; instead, they are justified through understanding and reasoning.\n\nIn contrast, empirical knowledge, or a posteriori knowledge, is dependent on sensory experience. This type of knowledge is derived from observations and experiments, such as knowing that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. A posteriori knowledge requires evidence from the external world to substantiate its claims.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between pure a priori knowledge and empirical knowledge lies in their sources: a priori knowledge is independent of experience and is justified through reason, while empirical knowledge relies on sensory experience and observation for its validation.
